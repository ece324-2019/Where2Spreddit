Does anyone else stay up at night because they feel if they go to sleep then they havent gotten enough free time at home?,"I'm a high school student, just a freshman, and sometimes I feel that if I go to sleep early then I'll just be like ""Well, this day just felt like school, barely any time at home."" Sometimes I just stay up so I actually feel more at home and not always have that feeling of just school, school, school. Does anyone else feel this way, maybe with work as well?  

Edit: I know people don't like it when others edit their message saying ""thank you"" or anything, but DANG did I not expect this post to be the highest post in the sub after I, ironically, came home from school. Thank you all!  

It is interesting to see a lot more people than I thought stay up for free time as well. I can't imagine going to school or going to work, then going to sleep only a couple or few hours later, only to do the same thing again the next day.",NoStupidQuestions

How do you repair relations with crows?,"Story is relevant.

My neighbourhood has a lot of crows. Over twenty of them. They are generally on good terms with one another.

I watched them band together and kill one of the crows. They left its dead body in my yard. I waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because I don't want crow guts everywhere.

However, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. This brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. None of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

Now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time I am outside. Some swoop. They are becoming more and more aggressive.

Confusion on why they'd be mad at me for cleaning up _their_ mess aside, how do I repair relations with these crows? I don't want to deal with being attacked every single day by multiple crows. 

Google is not helpful on this front at all. There is surprisingly little documentation on how to make crows like you after you've cleaned up the corpse of one of their peers.

"My brother died in a power line accident, did it hurt?","My brother died in a work accident. His drilling rig hit a 12,250-volt overhead power line.

Anyway, would it hurt to die that way? 

He was working the controls, standing on the back of the truck when the arm of the drill hit the power line. Witnesses saw the truck burst in flames, and the fire department wasn't able to make it to the truck for over an hour. 

I wanted to know if it was instant? Would it hurt? Did he burn alive? 

I told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn't even know what happened, but reading online I don't know if that's true. 

I'm crying right now, it just sucks and I miss him terribly. 

Edit: For those asking, this accident happened last May. The emotions are raw and fresh again because Easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.

I had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

With it coming up again, I just keep thinking why did I cancel? We could have had one last day with him but we didn't. I want to go up this year, in his memory but I don't know if I can.

"Matched with girl on tinder. Profile said 18, got phone number, she calls and reveals she's 10.","I blocked her and the texts were super short and completely non sexual. She randomly calls me and I was like shit she sounds super young. I text her and ask if she's 18. She said yes. Later she texts me and said she was lying. She FaceTimes me and she's in fucking kid pajamas and says she's 10 and calls me stupid. 

This is dangerous. What can I do to notify her parents ?  It is an ATT number. Should I call them? 



Edit : I looked up the number on social media. Nothing. I reported it to tinder using their online form. 

She used fake pictures of course. I could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. I will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. I reported it to tinder and that's all I will do. Some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. The second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) I hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. She revealed she was 10 while I was in the process of blocking the number. 

Even before she said she was under 18 I said absolutely zero things that wouldn't be okay to say to a ten year old, so I know I'm in the clear. I believe there's zero case to be made for any sort of enticing or anything like that. ",NoStupidQuestions

Am I a loser for being a virgin at 27 years old?,"I was born in Vietnam and moved to the US when I was 23. I had some girls interested in me during college (in Vietnam) but we never made a move because you know, it's Vietnam and it's the cultural thing back then. Then I moved to the US. Haven't found anyone since. There's so few asian in my city let alone Vietnamese. My college is full of white and latins (demographics). Don't get me wrong I don't mind dating out of my race but college folks here seem to keep to themselves, even men. I made some friends but as soon as semester ends they all go their own path. Some even deleted my number and ignored me. And it seems like all women are taken. In the end maybe it's because I'm not good looking (short, dark skin, average looking face). I also have moderate depression & anxiety. 


Then people made fun of me when they knew I'm a virgin. Even my relatives laughed behind my back too.

I made a post in a tech subreddit. Not only people didn't answer my question, but also they stalked my profile and made fun of me being a virgin. 

I know it might not be a big deal. But I felt so down after that. I felt like I should commit a suicide for being a useless loser in this world... 

Do I have hobbies? Yes, but most of them don't involve interactions with people. I keep a big fish tank and I love them. I play video games too. I've been rescuing stray dogs since I moved here.

"Just became homeless and have $130 and a bike, what do i do?","So a few hours ago i was kicked out of my parents house. I've been ""disowned"" or something. They made it really clear they wont be taking me back. Im 20, no job, no real friends and no family at all.

I was able to get my bike from my parents' since i did buy it with my own money and took my life savings which so happen to only be $130. Maybe it hasnt hit me yet cause its only been a few hours but its starting to get really late and i have nowhere to go or sleep. I was considering a hotel but that would take a huge chunk out of my money so im considering just doing an all nighter in a 24h mcdonalds. Im guessing I'll have to buy something every few hours so I won't get kicked out. 

So basically what the fuck do i do next? Im considering maybe odd jobs but i have no idea how to find them. So if there's an app or a website for that I'll take recommendations.




Edit: im saved!! Well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. He works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won't be until 5 or 6 am. Right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. Im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. This post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets

Edit2: wow this blew up fast. I see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. I never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. I wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. Im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. I'm extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. As long as i pay for the internet and my own food.

A lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. I worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).

A lot of people were recommending joining the military. I've considered the Navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)


((Edit3)) a lot of people have asked if i have a paypal or venmo. Im very glad that there are many nice people here on reddit, but i would much rather you keep your money or use it for someone who needs it more than me. My situation isnt that bad. And again, thanks to everyone for all the advice",NoStupidQuestions
I (27f) haven't had any friends for 10 years. Are others here like me?,"After going so long without regular socialization, were you able to make friends? How? 

I feel like I wear normal clothes, if not super fashionable. I'm groomed and wear some makeup. Ive been called a good person, etc by many different people. I want to think it's not me, but I'm the only common factor.

I have a very small family and they don't talk to me much either, generally don't seem to want anything to do with me. 

I guess it would just be cool to know I'm not the only one who has been so alone for so long.

Edit: I usually think these edits are annoying, but I really want to thank all of the support and everyone for sharing their experiences.

"My Dog went deaf with age and can no longer feel happy/excited when I praise her by saying ""good girl"". Is there a way to ""sign"" that she's a good girl and teach her to associate it with praise?

But since she's had hearing her whole life I feel like vocal praise is equally as important and that's not something I can give her anymore. Any redditors have experience in this field?

**Update**:Wow, this was way more of a response than I was expecting, thank you so much for the advice/ experiences/ helpful links redditor's! It seriously means a lot to me and I got some serious research to do.  Up until now I've just been practically yelling ""GOOD GIRL!"" loudly hoping she hears me lol, but imma make sure to buy some extra treats for training and get her used to my thumbs up's!

"Was I sexually assaulted? If so, what should I do?","For the past couple of months, I've been working in a restaurant. There's this girl there who keeps flirting with me and harrasing me, touching my arms, openly announcing she's looking through my social media profiles, won't stop snapping me or Facebooking me, I've since deleted her Snapchat and blocked her on Facebook. 

Anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. I moved my arm away to which she responded ""don't you like to be touched?"" to which I responded ""not by you"". So she went to kick me in the balls but I moved out of the way and said ""no chance"". 

As we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. She moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which I pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. She said ""I'm only joking"" before trying to do it again IN FUCKING PLAIN SIGHT OF THE OTHERS. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. All the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. The manager wasn't present during this.

Anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said ""dude, isn't that basically sexual assault?"" I responded ""is it?"" He said ""man, she literally molested you and tried again"" 

Honestly, I don't know what to think. I am contemplating telling the manager but I feel she'll laugh it off and class it as a joke because I'm a man. And no offence to us guys, but harrassment and sexual assualt isn't taken as seriously if a man is getting harrassed. Just think of it, if I had done that, I'd be fired on the spot and have the cops on my case.
