"super awesome update sat down on my friend's macbook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.. i never thought this would turn out the way it did and i really felt like i learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

i went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and i sincerely thank each and every one of you.

i did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it's around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so i wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, i'm withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. she sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she's going to take me to court.

i got served a few days later and went to court. i told the judge i gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current macbook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (i printed out the email i sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we'll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. i also told him that when i offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no i want the money in cash. when i told her i'd give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. i tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

she gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case i guess. after listening to both of us he ruled that i pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. so i'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

if it weren't for you guys i would've paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and i honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

i feel good for following all the advice here.

"(update) neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/

i'm sad about this update for the kid, i took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because i had questions about an issue i'm having and briefly explained it.

officer shows up, i invite him in and explain the whole situation. he isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. supervisor shows up and i go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where i have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

we watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. a few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what i put on the drive and then signed it, i repeated it all 3 times.

about 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 cps workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. this took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as i remember it and left out anything i wasn't 100% sure on.

the officers and cps workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times i'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

after they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. i'm in my garage so i don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the cps workers van and they left. the father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

i talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

i haven't seen them since the day after the post, i feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (i didn't think it was anything like they found, i just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). i should have called them earlier once the cps reports i was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything.",2
"i think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. he is a doctor.. this is in north texas. 

hey so i must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. i started typing it up in word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. 

i think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. i know this is going to be hard to explain, but i have been having gaps in memory that i have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  i was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then i started to notice that this seems to happen when i go on dates with him. 

i know it must be crazy, but i have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  i know its him as… well i wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

the first time it happened was when we were drinking and i wrote it off as too much to drink. we get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. but then there were a few times when i know we were not drinking. 

i decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. i had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time i talked with him. i remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. my car and his car was in the parking lot too so i was confused. 

i decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

after 3 days at his place i remembered everything so i was started to trust him again. knowing he was an ent i know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. i was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said i should be treating those sores. 

i had completely forgotten they were there. these little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. i got so freaked out he mentioned them that i decided to leave. 

the next day he came over to ""check on me"" and i remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. i never agreed to me with him and would never want to. he does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something i have no memory of. 

i am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

this has started to affect my work life as well as i start to get paranoid when i see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. i get paranoid that they are about to fire me. my friends also state i have been acting strangely and out of character. i have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when i do.  

is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? i do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so i want to be damn sure when i go to the police.

"neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive. male, late 20's, co

i quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (i haven't consumed alcohol in years) and i replaced that habit with drinking martinelli's sparkling apple juice. the juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to corona beer bottles. 
here lies my issue:
this morning i was walking to my car from my apartment and i had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. my neighbors basically jumped me from behind. one grabbed my daughter's car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. he was saying stuff like ""the nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby."" as a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone's screen is destroyed, and i think my nose is fractured. most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that i was not about drink and drive, but that i was drinking apple juice. this all just happened. i'm calling the cops. any suggestions?

btw, i didn't get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. they said they were doing their ""duty"" to protect the community.

update:

the police showed up. as soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. 

update #2:

both men were arrested and i will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. i will be talking to detectives. the police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. ",2
"update pa i followed and reported a drunk driver, then i got a ticket for driving past curfew. this is an update to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

i took the advice that i was given and i pled not guilty. last week i went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200b;

i brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that i called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. i also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and i printed out a copy of the ""justification"" law(https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/conscheck.cfm?txttype=htm&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

the hearing started with the officer saying that i was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why i was there, and that i voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. he said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

then it was my turn to speak. i said that while i did drive past curfew, it was because i had noticed an erratic driver and i was following him because i thought he was going to hurt someone. i felt that if i had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. i gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and i said that i would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. i argued that i had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 bac. (the judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the bac.)

finally, i brought up the justification defense. i argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. i said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because i drove in an otherwise safe manner.

the judge agreed and found me not guilty! he said that i had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that i had done the right thing. i'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200b;

tl;dr: went to court. police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" i presented my defense that i was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. judge agreed; i was found not guilty!",2
"i told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.. i got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. i didn't tell him all the details, but i told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and i showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. at first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because i told him i'd run away and call the police if he did.

he called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. they talked to us away from eachother and i had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who i told everything real specific. she was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

we went back home with them and i showed the police where my mother kept drugs that i'm pretty sure we're illegal. she wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and i don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs i think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. i think they're gonna look into it though. 

there were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. like a shelter or something. 

i should of done this year's ago, i feel really bad because i could have had my siblings taken better care of. i don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place i'm in now is way cleaner than i'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. they weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. they also weren't very happy with our house i could tell.

i hope we don't have to go back. and i hope it's ok to post this. even tho i don't need advice anymore. thank you to everyone who helped me.",2
"my college says if i miss class to testify at my assault trial, they'll drop me from my classes (update). op here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9gdico/my_college_says_if_i_miss_class_to_testify_at_my/?st=jn056nas&sh=90aa7f5f

thanks to everyone's terrific advice, i got my university's ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to rainn) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

within a day of meeting with the school's general counsel, my attorney and i were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

one of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration's decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching i am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

between my professors' incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting i was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (i'll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

the ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward. 

thank you everyone here who took time to give me such helpful advice. i appreciate all of you! ",2
"update: my father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). my step sisters father, won't allow me visitations... i got custody!!!. **edit: per the bots request, i am required to tell you that i live in washington (wa)**

here's my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

so after one of the most stressful months of my life, i can happily tell you all that i got custody of my step sister.

i did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people i've ever met in my life. i told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

after my step sisters bio dad was informed that i would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. the lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. she said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

after her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, i then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. i've never signed so many things in my entire life. because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, i was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

yesterday, i signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that i had 100% custody of my step sister. after i signed, we both cried and cried for hours. we're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. as i write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

the past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. i consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision i've ever made. these events have made me realise that family isn't just dna based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. i owe all of you for the rest of your lives. once i turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

i hope you all lead wonderful lives. give your loved ones a big hug for me.",2
"my wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! i'm growing very worried. posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

title says it all. we've been married for 3 years now. she's always been one for quirky, ""against-the-grain"" thinking and interests. however, it's not just harmless things like believing there's no gold in ft.knox, taking pictures of trash in ""aesthetic poses"", or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... no, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. but now there's this anti-vax bullshit. 

she got sucked into one of those anti-vax facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she's worked at a fucking wawa for 10 years. she messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on facebook. 

i love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her vitamin k shot, and the hep-b vaccine. however, now she's refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

i know that in her mind, she's coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we've had a number of arguments already. all her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

""oh well if you look this graph you'll see that the numbers of cases for <x disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <y vaccine>""

""i'm the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, i know i'm right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc..."" 

i've tried explaining to her the basic idea of ""correlation doesn't equal causation."" by showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. she followed that one up with ""we aren't talking about ice cream and murder, we're talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! they're completely different!""

i've tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn't as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. she follows that up with ""those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and ""big-pharma""

she won't budge and hasn't budged for weeks now. our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and i'm worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could've been easily avoided. 

i am in florida. is there anyway i can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife's knowledge? what are my options here? legally speaking, what kind of leeway do i have? i don't want this to lead to divorce but i just feel quite lost at the moment. 

edit: thank you to everyone for your advice! i come to the decision that i will try and sit my wife down one last time, as i am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome i desire. if that fails, i have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because i know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child. will keep you updated",2
"update to: someone is threatening to release nude photos of me that were taken when i was underage and i'm terrified that i'll lose my job and be arrested for what is essentially child porn (ohio). original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/

so as the title states, last year i was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when i was 14/15. i thought i would update now that it's come to a resolution.

i went to see a lawyer the day after i made that post. he drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that i had nothing to worry about. it was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. then i got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

i panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. he was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. he was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). i wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that i wasn't really allowed to know about.

anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus i'm getting married in a few months and i'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. so i thought i'd update here with the good news! i was afraid that i'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys i got up the courage to deal with the situation. i really appreciate the advice i got here! thank you again so much.

"i was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the da finally got around to my case. i did nothing wrong.. okay, so a few days ago i was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. i lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

i was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (i'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest i didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something i did not do). i had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where i was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. i'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything i told him to at this appearance i had because a simple background check shows i don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened i was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). he literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

so then i sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. i tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper i had but he was never in and never came to see me. i couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. i don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, i was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because i can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months i'm about to owe.

when he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the da who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter i mailed them until then also. after that appearance i got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and i was released.

what can i do for any of this? apparently someone with the same name but a different dob shot a building after a fight and is a felon but i sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless i pay some crazy fees (how am i liable for these fees if it was a error?!). this is in madison, wisconsin

edit: thanks for all the replies guys and gals, i'll contact the wisconsin branch of the aclu tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. also i appreciate the messages offering to help me if i need it but i can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.

edit 2: to clear up more confusion about my car. the city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. the storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and i only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. the towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and i can get my car but told ""good luck"". also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.",2

"subaru service center gave my car to someone else. final update

so i dropped my subaru wrx off to be serviced at a third party service center.  they called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when i arrived today i waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  they offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  should i take any action against them/is there any action i can take against them. 

<edit: i need to clarify a mistake i made earlier when posting this, they are not an official subaru service center as i previously thought.  they are just a third party service center, i have and do not want any hate going out towards subaru, they did nothing.  this was not their fault and i love their cars/company.  i will be posting a final update later tonight about how everything is ending.  thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

edit:

thank you all for all of the advice.  im not good with legal stuff and if i had not posted here i probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  i called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while i called the cops.  i still have not seen it but i was told the damage was extensive and that i would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  at this point im going to get a lawyer involved right? i shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  even if they offer to cover fixing it im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  they if i didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but im really not having that.  not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

final update:
hey guys i just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  i did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  little backstory, when i first bought the car in november the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  that is what i was getting fixed.  that being said, in the end i will be getting a new 2019 wrx, i am pressing charges against the sm for theft, i have filed official complaints with the motor vehicle dealer board and the office of the attorney general consumer protection section, and i will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  luckily my lawyer was pro bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  all in all i am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  without this thread i would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  for everyone dm'ing me and asking about what the location is, i am not at liberty now nor will i be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  it is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  thanks again everyone!

my location is washington dc

"update, my son took the boba fett figure.. so, i never honestly expected the post i made to get where it did. i also never expected the barrage of support and hate. i will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.

&#x200b;

so, why am i back? well, because i feel like i need to be. i'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how i acted or seek validation. i'm here because i feel that for myself i need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.

&#x200b;

so, i want to talk about something first before i get into the update. many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how i reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. i was also hit pretty hard for how i was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. to give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. we have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. we're just to different in some senses. he's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. in these past few years we've tried to fix this. work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. during our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and i wont lie i never understood the appeal. it is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200b;

so, when my son stole and damaged his property i didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. so when he asked for 2,000 to fix it i really didn't feel like it was worth it. was this wrong of me? maybe. i don't feel bad about defending my son, i only feel bad that i discounted my brother in the process.

sorry about that. like i said, i don't want sympathy. i only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

so, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. i had no idea what i was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. we collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. during this time i got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. i offered to pay in full.

(also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so i asked him. he had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

my brother said he plans to not sue us. his renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. at first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. this was the plan until last night.

during the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. it turns out my son stole the figure to sell. he had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. he didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

suffice to say, i am not happy about this. i won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. my brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly i think this might be for the best in the end. the way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and i believe the only option that i can live with myself making is this. i will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

so, thank you all for the advice. the support and hate are what i needed as a true wake up call. like i said, i don't need pity. i'm doing this so that i can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.",2
"my daughter disowned my underage grandson. what do i do?. i posted in r/justnofamily and was told to post here for better advice on what to do in this situation. 


my sixteen-year-old grandson was kicked out by his mother because he came out of the closet. he travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. i found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first i'm hearing about it. 


i phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. she said some very nasty things. i honestly thought i raised her better than to act in such a manner. but my grandson doesn't want to go back home, i'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but i want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible.

"co my ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. she now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. i want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible.. me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. there were a variety of reasons for this that i wont get into here. one of them though was her anti-science beliefs. she's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200b;

we have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. my ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. and threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200b;

around this time i also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. when this happened i decided i wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. the only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. my ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. the judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200b;

ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" i demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. so, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. she somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. i have been stressed out from the minute i got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. my daughter must have picked up on this and thought i was mad at her because when i was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200b;

turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. she made my daughter lie about it. instead she has been using ""special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" what about the forms i got saying she was vaccinate? there fake. i called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. so my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200b;

i'm pissed to say the least. my daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. my ex doesn't know i know yet and i told my daughter not to tell her, i want her gone now. how do i approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. i have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. i also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones i have a forged. i'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but i would like to know going in what to do. thank you.",2
"little sister (16) needs an abortion. texas wants parental consent which we can't get. can i take her to new mexico? (update: it's done). https://redd.it/6m79kf

so it is done. we called an abortion clinic in new mexico and asked for advice. they were very helpful. scheduled an appointment.

i told my parents that i'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in new mexico for 2 days. they never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. so in the morning i picked her up and we drove to new mexico. we took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. she spent the day and that night at my place. i called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so i'll bring her there tomorrow.

she was feeling fine by then. so nothing suspicious at all. she's very happy this worked out the way it did and i'm happy that she's happy. i told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. you can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. once we knew i won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. ",2
"update mn school is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. i'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.. i'm updating my last post(https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

i did what you all told me to do. i wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. i also called them. they said they will speak with the school.

i was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. i did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

i said loudly ""i think you owe me an apology.""

she said ""yes, i should not have accused you of cheating.""

i said ""yes, and another apology for saying i don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

she said ""i'm sorry"" and left.

the principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

i said ""it wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

he apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. i then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

so things are sorted out now. but also, i'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. i only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and i was very pissed off at them. and the counselor had given me horrible advice.

thanks for pointing me in the right direction!",2
"update - my brother went missing 6 years ago. police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? how do we get more information. illinois.. https://redd.it/74we5z

i talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. they found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. the officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

there days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed dna samples to confirm. dna confirmed it was him.

what happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). that was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. that's when they decided to... his friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

the officer says my brother didn't die in pain. it was multiple gunshots. you'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. we had a funeral for him. now there's a place that i can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

i thank all of you who helped.

"update had a falling out with the girl i love and got served a cease and desist order. what can i legally do? michigan (x-post on r/relationships). past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

oh boy. i've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. i wasn't going to, but i know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and i actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and i read all the comments there. it was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. i decided i needed to post again for some closure. i would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

for those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so i'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. i want to take full accountability for everything, so i want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

first, i want to assure everyone that i didn't contact that girl ever again. since i moved, i no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (i don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. i have avoided getting any information about her at all). the way i acted and the way i hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but i know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. if she wants to get closure by talking to me, i'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. i don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. i learned in my classes that men do that a lot. i don't want to hurt her anymore, so i will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

i was distraught after my last post here. i admit i came here looking for validation, not help. i had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that i was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that i needed help. all of these people were right. i don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive i was in response to the comments). i checked myself into therapy in michigan the week after i posted here. i knew something was wrong, but i was still in denial. i thought i needed help with heartbreak. i didn't recognize that i actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that i used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. after a few sessions, i started seeing a psychiatrist too. i got on mood stabilizers and i started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way i was acting. something that couldn't be cured by medication. after talking it over with my therapist, i decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my aunt's house. within a month of me posting here, i had moved into her house. 

after moving, i started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. i had a fresh idea of the issues i wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that i was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in michigan (though i wasn't stalking anyone at this point, i was just obsessing in my mind. which is still bad, but i wasn't actively victimizing anyone). i realize that in addition to therapy, i needed more help. my therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so i signed up voluntarily. i attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. the goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  i know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? people like me. people like me in the last post. i look like a normal person. i grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. monsters come in all shapes and sizes and i fooled myself by saying because i didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because i wasn't ""like"" the abusers i saw on tv, that i wasn't one. but i am. i can't take back what i've done, but i can promise myself i will never victimize anyone else again. 

in conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. i want to say that i do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. i made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because i thought i had the right to dictate how others interact with me. the class is a year-long class and i have only been in it for a month, but i have already learned so much. i have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. but i believe that since i've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. i've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so i made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people i am stalking or believe i am in love with (i talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and i'm sorry for how i decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice i asked for.

**tl;dr**: i ceased, i desisted, and i got mental health help. thanks to everyone.

**edit**: wow, just wow. i didn't expect this response. i guess this is a top post of all time. 
i wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. i read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though i didn't reply to many. i cried a lot while reading them. 

2. i didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. i'm not sure why i did it, but i don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. i don't know if i deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. but thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. i've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program i am in. the program i am in is specific to my area, so i'd rather not disclose the name. however, i encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" i did some research today about the class i am in and that is what these types of classes are called. they all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. there is no official federal program i don't think.

4. i am not healed. i have a lot of obsessive thoughts and i have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. my meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process i need to change and that cant be done with pills. i have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. i have never had real ""friends"" until the ones i have now. before jaime, i definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women i had crushes on and men i wanted to be friends with. it was never as bad as it was with jaime, but i still am sure i made people uncomfortable.  i also have some self-harm behaviors i am working out. so to the person who was worried that i would use all of the good praise to say ""oh i'm perfect now so i can do what i want,"" trust me, i know i am fucked up and i want to change. i want to have normal relationships and friendships. i want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

please get help if you need it. take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",2
"update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. i'm back after 6 months.. you can read my old post here: florida: parents hired people to kidnap me. my brother ended up pointing a gun at them. what do i need to do to get emancipated?(https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

i sadly don't have any good news. just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. the camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

the place wasn't like anything i imagined it would be. i tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. they also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. whatever you do they see it as resistance. their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. even when i was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. it took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that i'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. i got to the point that i didn't care about anything anymore, i just wanted it to end.

they knew about my youtube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. they had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if i truly hate my old self or not. she'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also youtuber) and i was supposed to agree with her, if i took things personally they knew i was acting and wasn't ready.

they got me when i was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. the next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. i was thinking all the time and effort i placed there was gone.

from there i didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. so things became easier. they'd teach me to be a nice girly christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. it was like they were sending me into a children's book. then my dad came and brought me back home.

when i got back my brother actually told me that my youtube account wasn't deleted. since i was using his email for recovery he got a notification when i logged in from the camp because it was a new place. so he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. so my account is intact. the assholes at the camp were lying.

i don't know if i'm the same person or not or how much i've changed but i really hate my parents. i hate them so much that a year ago i couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. there are 448 days until i'm 18 and i'm counting every single day until this is over and then i'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

my big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who i trust. when i was gone he went to police, cps, even talked to a lawyer and a pi to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. my parents came after my $15,000 which i had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. but my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. he continued to post the videos that i had prepared in the pipeline when i was gone so i continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

that's it for me. from what i understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",2

my mom and step dad are really into ""new age"" science and beliefs. i've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird ""support group"". i say that in quotes because i have no fucking clue who they are. when i'm around they never mention any group names or what ""organization"" they work for or are apart of. because of this i have not had much luck finding out stuff as ""new age cult"" gives to many results to look into.

this monday my mom and stepdad sat me and my 4 siblings down. they told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more ""stable"" location within a spiritual community. according to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their ""mind awakening"" school where ever we move. i tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. according to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. i've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but i've been unable too. they cut of the internet, phone and tv tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. i'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way i've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. i was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is ""closed"" and that i will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the ""leaders"" will love to meet me and put me in their programs.

&#x200b;

i need to know what the fuck i can do here. my dad has shared custody of me and since monday i've had no contact with him. he is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been ""informed"" and supports this 100%. i tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. he lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. i'm at a friends house because i was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after i told my parents i wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and i plan to stay here tonight if i can. my parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"".

&#x200b;

i'm so lost right now it makes me sick. i do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and i need to know what the fuck i can do here. can i just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. if my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.

&#x200b;

edit:

i talked to my mom and told her because i would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times i could see my friend i would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was ""trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view"". i got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. he did not agree and was told i didn't want to talk to him. my 15 year old sister's dad was told the same despite the fact he has primary custody and she only spends the summers with us. my sisters dad is going to call cps too and i just got done with my call to them but i wont repeat what they said here. i will be spending the night here and when my mom asks me to come back tomorrow my dad has told me not to go back and tell her that he will be flying down here to florida immediately if i don't check in with him or he hears i went back to her. he says that he is already looking into emergency custody (i want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great. they both have been great and are working with my dad right now to help me). i also will be going and buying a burner phone tomorrow and withdrawing all my money from the bank. my dad says he will handle getting my stuff from my mom when the time comes. thanks guys for the advice.",2

raised hell with the county commissioner for my district, showed them video and threatened to lawyer up, he pulled in the director for the road and bridge department then pulled in the director of zoning and planning.

my driveway is no longer a road and i am no longer being assessed for repairs and i am legally allowed to do what is necessary to stop traffic from crossing my property so both sides of the property have been ditched and bermed and a steel pole gate across the side i plan on keeping open. sheriffs dept has been out multiple times dealing with people trying to enter the property but they are starting to get the hint that road is closed.

we are currently in negotiations for a portion of my property to be purchased and turned into a road but not 10 feet from my house, there is a county commissioners meeting next tuesday and it is on the docket to be brought up.

&#x200b;

my driveway is no longer on google maps as a road, signage posted private property no trespassing, dead end road, etc etc etc. several people are angry about it as they are used to the pass-through but with the cameras i have installed i've been able to get clear images of vehicles and license plates of the worst offenders and they will be cited according to the sheriffs dept.

&#x200b;

i have contacted amazon and ups about their trucks crossing my property, ups has instructed their drivers to no longer use that route, haven't heard a thing back from amazon yet but i have stopped two of their trucks so far,both of which were ticketed by the sheriffs dept and the one needing a tow to get pulled off the berm it got stuck on.

"update i take prescription medication for adhd. started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. left old job for new one and now i'm unemployed.. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)

i am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

i met with an attorney for a consultation thursday. after talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has adhd. i could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. she told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as i could get punitive damages. i told her i don't want to sue anyone if i don't have to, i just want this job offer back as i have been waiting a long time for a job like this. she also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, i could file an eeoc charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. due to an unrelated incident a while back, i have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my google drive. i played the calls with my manager to the attorney. when my manager informed me of the preliminary result i explained to her my prescription medication and my adhd. the attorney told me it was good that i disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and adhd would not cause any issues in performing my duties). i was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. the call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but i would be paid for my one day of work. as far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if i knew i would fail. i had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

i asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because i signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. she would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. she said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. she said ultimately the point of having a lab test and mro is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the mro is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. if it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of hr and their legal department. when she initially talked to the head of hr, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. he called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. my attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if i could come into her office that afternoon. i agreed.

when i was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of hr, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. essentially this call was an apology to me. the head of hr profusely apologized for this. he went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in hr and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. if he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. he went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of hr felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. they want me to come back in monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. he stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they ""want nothing more than a person with my background on their team."" he even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch monday.

he told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my adhd. i told them that wasn't necessary as i am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

so now i have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of hr. i owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. i wish i could personally shake hands with all of you. i was so scared before reading your comments. thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

edit: i'm going to disclose my medication. i take vyvanse. a lot of people assume i'm taking adderall. i used to take adderall but my doctor suggested i try vyvanse when it came out. although similar and made by the same company, vyvanse is a much better medication for me. the release is more controlled, it's not as ""intense"" as adderall, my appetite is not affected, i sleep much better with it, and it doesn't give me the ""crash"" that adderall does when wearing off.

"ex-wife is suing me for child support. i don't even have a penis... (update). original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/585svt/exwife_is_suing_me_for_child_support_i_dont_even/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

i have both good news and bad news.

the good news is that i won the battle with my ex. i put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. i had documents about me showing i don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (i don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before i married her. however paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. that ended the case. it took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but i won. i don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. maybe she thought that i won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.

the bad news is that, i'm dying. as i mentioned in the comments of my original post, i was battling cancer at the time that i made the post. it was the fourth time in my life that i was dealing with cancer and even though i had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and i have very little chance of beating it again. i will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. i'm happy with the life i've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until i finally rest for good. 

thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. it helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. you could see from my comments on the original post that i was almost ready to give up. ",2
"(az) our neighbors dog was poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. i say absolutely not. how should we proceed?. i guess some background is in order here. earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. we were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. the next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. they did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. the next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. this all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

so they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. we tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

so we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. we have yet to contact the lawyer. 

we had made the initial report to animal control last thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" i was really taken aback and i think i asked ""i think so, do you need some?"" 

he then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. i literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. i explained that i actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and i really have no way of knowing which dog is which). he said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" i got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


the officer then asked if he could take everything. i said i wasn't comfortable with that but i would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. i did exactly this. i was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. again i was taken completely aback and said that i'm not sure what he'd be looking for. he told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. it took me as second but i asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. i asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if i remember) ""not yet."" 
i asked him if i could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. i said i would really rather not but i would get back in touch with him. he gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

i just got home and told my wife. my wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. we have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but i feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

she thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. i say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. i'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. wife thinks we should let them, i say absolutely not.

>edit: hey guys i'm involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in dm but it would sure be easier if i could just answer them once. i'm sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, i really don't want to say where i am and my attorneys name. all the laws i found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

so thank you to everyone who responded. and i guess thank you to everyone in the dms who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, i want to sleep in my own house. just to allay the fears of the other nice dm's, i did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

i took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on monday night. i also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. i called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

he was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the da actually pursuing this were slim to none. he did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, i could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. he said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


so basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as i type this) but i just heard (wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. in fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. the people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. they also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all i know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people i've ever encountered). the can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). so with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

so our complaint to animal control from last thursday is still on the books. the lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. the criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

"cops completely destroyed interior of my car looking for drugs, found nothing. i had purchased a used cadillac a few months ago for a good price from a mechanic i knew. he said his son was driving it. when i first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of bho oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. i threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. 
flash forward to the other night and i was pulled over for an improper lane change. officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when i was being pulled over. he asked to search the vehicle and which point i said no. waited half an hour for the dog to show up. he alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  he checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. after his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. they cut into the leather seats. they also cut into my spare tire. mind you, i have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. they cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. i'm obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. after this well over 2 hour ordeal, i was told i was free to go. when asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. before i do that i would like to know if there's any better options and how i should pursue this. the seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there's so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what i probably would've payed for it. not to mention they also ruined my spare. thank you.

"neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs. for the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

at first i just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. however after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

i've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

she will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. i've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. i don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

when she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when i'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. before i started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. now since i've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. somehow this is my fault.

now i'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred german shepard, an english bulldog and a mix sheppard/bulldog).

i just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. i have a pool and if she falls in when i'm not home she could very well drown. that's why i installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, i truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

i've called the local child and family services office (cps) several times in the past two months to report it because i feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. i have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that i've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when i open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

i feel like i've done everything i can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. i just have no idea what to do now? i've debated calling the police when she enters but i don't know how that will escalate.",2

i watched the vhs tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. that's why he kept his savings in cash. he didn't even trust a safe deposit box. that's why they were kept in his walls. and it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. i found the other $20,000.

i went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. she talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

i scheduled an appointment with the bank. when i told them it's for a cash deposit they told me i don't need an appointment for that but i told them it's for a large deposit. they still said no appointment is necessary, but then i said it's a very large deposit. so they booked the appointment. everything went smoothly at the bank. they made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. money was in my account a few hours later.

i made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and i now have a larger emergency fund.

"updatefired for being fat. update to: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bx4q0p/fired_for_being_fat_ct/   

i posted this 2 weeks ago and a lot has happened. something happened before i could go any further with the lawyer i spoke to.

the monday following the incident i was asked to come speak with a vp of hr i'd never met and only knew by name, because they work directly for the company that bought ours out. when i walked in the conference room there were 4 people waiting for me, 2 of which i was told was part of legal. what i didn't realize, is my friend who i mentioned in the comments of the other post ended up saying something to another coworker because he was so horrified at the situation (even though i told him to keep it secret). this information ended up making it's way up the chain and was not taken well, to say the least. i was asked to explain exactly what happened, who i told, and asked a lot of questions. everything i said seemed to make them very uncomfortable, especially when i told them i was in touch with a lawyer. they had me leave the room for nearly 40 minutes and then called me back in and let me know they were very concerned about this situation, and assured me it was an isolated power trip basically....  

this is the holy shit part. they say that due to my long tenure in my position, knowledge of how the team works, and my relationship with clients that they felt i would be a good fit for the position the jerk manager sat in, and if i wanted the position it was mine, as their way of saying sorry. they also made sure to mention the large salary increase and bonuses this would come with. i took a couple minutes to think about it, and took the offer. btw i'm not stupid, i know they did this so i wouldn't take any legal action against them, but i love my job and don't blame them for the actions of a 20something on a power trip. i also know it came down to he said/she said, and would've been a hard case to prove.

there's going to be a company-wide training on gender and interpersonal relations, and i finally have an office with a door i can actually close! i'm in the field a lot less now, so i guess the jerk got what he wanted, because now i don't interact face to face nearly as much as i used

"update iowa city threatening a lawsuit to get me to take down a website criticizing town odors. this is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jubfl/iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me_to_take/

hello r/legaladvice,

a few months ago i posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town i live in sent a letter demanding that i take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. most of the comments i received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my first amendment rights, and yes, i should seek a lawyer. 

so i did so. i set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. however, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended i speak with someone ""outside the city's little sphere of influence"". 

skipping over unnecessary details, i met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. i updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about "" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services"". 😉

once i updated the website and the city realized i wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. i went, although now i realize i probably should not have done so. he was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought i should take down the website because it was hurting the town and ""we both want what's best"" for it. he also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think i should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. i declined the interview, because i was afraid i'd get sued (whether justified or not) if i said something the city didn't like.

of course, i was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. so she ran her story, and i was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. what's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. they were also quoted as saying ""there may be legal stuff coming down the road"".

a few weeks later i received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. it was the attorney from the original letter writing ""on his own time"" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. he told me i was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. the letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.

this was around mid-january, 2018 (i received the first letter mid-december, 2017). everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until i got an email from the legal director at the aclu of iowa. on the advice of reddit, i had emailed both the aclu and the eff, but after over a month with no response i had figured they were too busy to look at my case. i was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.

i spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the aclu of iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. toward the end of february we filed suit in federal court, and by march 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:

1. they had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content i produce regarding the town.
2. they must pay legal damages to me.
3. they must pay attorney fees to the aclu.
4. they must write an apology letter to me.
5. my favorite part, the city's staff *and its attorneys* must take first amendment training.

all in all, i'm incredibly impressed with the aclu's work on this case. i know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but i think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were. i'm super grateful to the aclu for helping me with this, because as i said above, i wouldn't have been able to afford an attorney and the city would have gotten away with their threat. i'm also grateful to r/legaladvice for encouraging me to contact the aclu -- thank you for all of the help!",2

aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. he wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. i hadn't complained to them myself so i did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

thanks for the advice in the previous thread, especially /u/wittyandpithy's excellent not-practicing-legal-advice to actually pay to use a legal professional.

"update - dog ate neighbor's drone. *edit: original(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

a small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

i was served a summons by a sheriff's deputy, neighbor decided to take me to small claims over his drone. my mil is a paralegal secretary, so i was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. he seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. he also suggested i counter sue and how i could possibly add in more damages. 

he also told me that my neighbor and i technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under faa regulations. i called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). i don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. they took my information and have called me back once, so i know they're investigating but don't know anything else. not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

i brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos i had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. his main argument to the judge was that i ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which i (somehow) trained him to do"". which, yes i had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so i have somewhere to sit and eat outside. i argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. in the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). he is also banned from flying over my property, and i installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. he seems pretty upset with me, so i wanted to be careful. 

the only thing that could make this better is if the faa finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.",2
"doctor's office keeps telling my mom my test results. i'm 22 and no longer even live with her.. background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. my gp who i have seen since i was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. i moved away for college when i was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new gp and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since i've seen him half my life. 

i get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication i take to make sure that i'm not getting too little/too much. the results of this information or the fact that i have those tests done isn't a big secret i want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless i were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. 

the first time i had this work done, i hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. they even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/ml the medication level was. again, it's not like to my mother this is anything i want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and i never received any call about my results. i go in for these monthly, so the next month that i went i told the woman working in the lab of the office that i wanted to update my information to make sure i got the results (i thought also since i had been seeing this doctor since i was 10 i probably had never given them my phone number). a few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; i again got no call from the office. once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when i explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, i was a little tipped off that i wasn't called again. i chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. 

at this visit i had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. he asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. i wasn't worried that i was pregnant, but i knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. i asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. it did, so on my way out i stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that i and i alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. they nonchalantly agreed and i asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. i happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. my mom blew up at me asking why i needed to take a pregnancy test (i didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). that all blew over, but at this point i was pissed that she kept getting this information. 

i ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of hipaa and she knows it after working in a hospital. she laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since i was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, ""it's not a big deal - i'm your mom!""

since then, i've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. to no surprise there are no issues. i don't really know what to do here. since i cut ties with that doctor, i no longer have personal problems with this, but i'm sure other people do without even knowing it. i don't have resources really for a lawyer. i might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. so how serious is it really?

"mother took 500$ dollars from my account to pay tithing that i said i don't want to pay. so my parents are heavily mormon and we just recently had a tithing settlement and when they asked me if i had paid my tithing i told them no. they then asked me if i had a plan to fix that and i told them that i worked too hard just to give that money away.

anyways so afterwards, my mom, who is my account co-owner as i am under 18, decided to take 10% of my bank account out and refuses to give it back.

this isn't legal right?

*update: i plan to slowly over the next few days, withdraw the money over time. i will leave some in as to not look suspicious. i will try talking to my mom about paying the 500$ just to keep her on my good side. 

*update 2: ok now this has gotten ridiculous.

turns out my dad is sick of my mom overspending so he did two things. he's stopped paying tithing himself and swapped my moms credit card for a debit card. my mom took my money to pay off tithing for him and she gave me roughly 200$ back. she said she'll give me the rest back and that she's still disappointed in me for not paying my tithing. i'm at a loss what to do next.

*update 3: doesn't sound like i'm getting my money back any time soon, both my parents are in a significant amount of debt, my parents fought a lot yesterday apparently. my mom spent almost 10,000$ on stuff for the past month or so. my dad has started making cuts in our budget to fix this, tithing being one of them. 

i'm still following through with taking my money and putting it in a place where my parents can't touch it. just in case they get any ideas.",2
"co my retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. i fear that she intends to abuse other children and i want to stop it. i have proof of her abuse against me. how do i go about this?. between the ages of 9-11, i took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. if memory serves, i believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that i took lessons with her. the only reason i stopped going to her was because she retired. 

my teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". i won't get into specifics, but i have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

i never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

recently, i found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. i am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and i want to stop it before it's too late.

so my question is: legally, what can i do and what should my course of action be? i don't want money, i just want her stopped.

i have the photographs, but i am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

please walk me through this, because i genuinely don't know what to do, and i'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because i didn't stop it sooner.

"update neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. now she's trying to sue me. we're the ones with 29k in medical bills. nc usa. here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=jsce6bw3&sh=7f56780f


my sister and i spent the weekend after i posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
the guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
he is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

the neighbors mean dog has been put down.  she was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

we've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

she was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
one from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  i'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

one for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

her lawsuit against me has a court date of march 5th.  after she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   she then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

she finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in nc where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

now for some extra facts. 

my left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on february 27th. 

our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  the vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  she still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

the destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

the day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  she broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  she straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  she also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

we called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. they asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

the video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  it shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. it also shows her audibly laughing during it. she only started trying to help when i started smashing her dog into the ground. 

we also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the hoa. 

he said it's pointless to go after the hoa and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  our lawyer did tell us that the hoa has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

there was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

i honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

either way, my sister and i both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of march. 

thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. you guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

i'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  please feel free to ask any questions and i'll answer whatever i can.

thank you to the user who suggested i look in the facebook marketplace. i found it in there and got the name of the man who took it. 

i took that information to the police and the man had other complaints of petty theft against  him. 

even better, one of the people who helped me move realized my neighbor has a video doorbell and i was able to get proof to the cops that the man stole my couch with me standing right there with a moving truck and boxes. 

a friendly officer went to his house and got my couch back, as well as a few other stolen outdoor furniture pieces (one was a bench from a local restaurant, i don't know the other situations.) 

i deeply appreciate your legal advice, i now won't have to tell my parents the beloved multi-generational couch is gone. cheers",2
"(update) my autistic brother was banned from the local hobby shop.. so i came here yesterday to ask for some advice on my situation and i thought i might as well leave a update(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9l2z39/co_my_autistic_brother_was_banned_from_the_local/)

&#x200b;

so i want to start out by saying that i was wrong and i want to apologize to anyone i may have hurt with my last question. it was wrong of me to defend my brothers actions and i wish i could have seen that at the time but thats the past.

i went to my parents and talked to them and they have begun to see that they were wrong too. me and my dad went last night and apologized to the shop owner for our actions and how we treated him and the victim of my brother and that we agree with his ban. the owner was genuinely happy with us for this so i'm glad we did that. the girl who who my brother touched was also at the store and despite what many of you said i felt that i needed to apologize to her too because she deserved it after my actions and she thanked me for it. my parents are now looking into different options to deal with my brother including therapy and other programs. 

&#x200b;

i really want to end this by saying thank you for helping me learn i was wrong. like i said i'm sorry if i hurt anyone with my post, i didn't mean to do that but it was wrong of me too. this has been a learning experience for me and i hope that i can become a better person because of it.",2

hey guys. i first just want to thank you all for all the support regarding my last post.

i've had a free consultation with a personal injury lawyer and have filed a police report like many of you suggested. i let my cousin and aunt and uncle know this and they immediately ended up offering to pay my hospital bill (and ambulance ride) in full.

my cousin gave me a half-hearted apology and his parents told me he won't be leaving the house for the next year and will be severely punished for this.

i've decided not to press charges, i don't really have the money/time for it, and all i needed was my medical expenses paid. i just plan on not going to any family gatherings where he is for a long long long time.

thanks again for all the love and support.

"a former air bnb guest put a hold on my mail for everyone at my address and has been paying to hold the mail for 2 months! (texas). its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  one guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  a lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  one lady missed the receipt of a death certificate.  we thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  so i tried calling the usps and that got me nowhere.  going down in person was the only way to do this i guess.  turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal po box?  who knows.  the post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  still, how could this have happened?  surely this can't be legal.  i got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  she hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one. 

edit:  well that was quick~!  the post office called me directly before i could even report her and pro-actively already reported this lady to the postal inspector.  they're very certain what she did is illegal.  thanks /u/beamdriver for the advice!  important lesson here kids:  don't fuck with people's mail, because the usps apparently is the most effective law enforcement agency there is.

"can you legally steal your own property hours after a police officer hands it to the thief?. yesterday my phone was stolen at lunch and i chased down the girl who stole it making a scene in the mall. a plano police officer overheard the commotion and came over.

the girl tried to say i was trying to steal her phone. i told the officer that i could unlock the phone and the girl could not, i told him my pictures are on the phone, my bank information was on the phone, and basically my entire life was there to prove it was mine. 

he refused to give me the chance or believe me. he told me to back off and leave her alone or he would arrest me. 

i left. 

the girl was wearing a uniform of one of the shops in the mall so i decided to check back 2 hours later. i saw her set my phone down by the cash register of her work after failing again to break into my phone. 

when no one was in her store and her back was turned i took my phone back. 

before anyone starts going off on me for it, i know. i know exactly what i did was extremely stupid but i am still paying for that phone so...yeah. 

i am asking for the legalities of it.

the phone was set on a counter and not in an area that would be considered employee only, the store was open, and the phone is legally mine. 

the place is obviously heavily video monitored so there is no doubt that i am on video. my questions are simply did i break any laws?

if the phone was on the counter, not behind the register but on the counter, the store was open and i was not asked to leave, and the phone is legally my property did i break the law?

edit: thanks for all of the info. i do not wish to pursue a police complaint nor do i wish to report the crime. i am too lazy for that.

"update girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. i don't. what are my rights? (texas). this is my first post.(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice) 

short version: i'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

long version:

if you remember, i asked about how i should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. i listened to the suggestions. got a lawyer. put myself on the registry as well.

she really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. i was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. but in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. so we had no messy legal right over it.

the childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. my lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

so i have my baby daughter!

taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. i feel like i have something to live for! my family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. i also got a promotion at work. i realized that i need to be more ambitious because i now have a baby to provide for. a higher position was open at my work and i asked for the promotion but they told me i'm too young. i offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that i can do it. after a month they gave me the job! 

as most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), i had my lawyer file for child support after i had full custody. my ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. she actually called me names and various insults and all of that. but i didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. she said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. i don't know. i didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but i think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. i didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, i'm not good at studying) but i want to make sure my daughter has the chance! my sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and i think i'll send most of the child support payments there once i start receiving them.

thank you all. ",2
"husband surprised me with a divorce, cleaned out bank accounts and shut off credit cards. how can i find an attorney with no money?. tonight when my husband got home from work he informed me he wants a divorce and will be leaving until it's done. this is not a huge surprise honestly, ever since our daughter was born we've just not been getting along. what is a surprise is it's suddenness.

i've been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born two years ago, it just didn't make sense to work and spend 90% of what i made on day-care.

so in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""good luck with the mortgage and bills, i've taken my money out of our bank account and turned off your card on my credit"". i would say i was shocked, but i really am not. he's very mean when he's angry and never has seemed to connect with his daughter, he wanted a boy and from the day we got the word we were having a daughter he's been distant. 

i obviously need an attorney, i logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. what resources can i begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until i can find childcare and a job? is there anything i can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney? i understand it's all ""his"" money but we are married with a child. i don't see how he can just leave us with nothing all of the sudden.

&#x200b;

so after i stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. my dad said not to go so i somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and i would come home that night. this plan didn't work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn't contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. it didn't take long before my mom caught on that i was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  my mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because i had been ""corrupted"" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound. my friends parents called the police and i called my dad and he got to talk to my mom. i'll leave it short and say this was a nightmare situation that almost ended with my mom being charged with  trespassing.

&#x200b;

my mom and dad argued on the phone for over 3 hours outside of my friends house. in the end my dad made it so i would not have to go with them but the only ""safe"" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. i stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. my mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and ""save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: my step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month i was coming no matter what. 

&#x200b;

after a week of this, everything changed. my mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. my sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. during this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  after this my mom called me one last time.

&#x200b;

she proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". all to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand i was being used by evil.""during these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn i was."" according to her i am a ""evil seed"" and that i not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". i also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. she told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. she ended by telling me that i was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". the last contact i know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

at the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. i moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. things are still pretty raw right now and i really don't feel like getting into the emotions i feel towards this. but i feel like at least updating this may be a start. thank you everyone who gave advice and sent me kind messages on here offering help. i really do appreciate it :)",2

"dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. how do i protect myself legally?. i have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. a few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

the last few months have been hell. they have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. they are loud way past our community quiet hours. they have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). i have recorded it. it wakes up my 2 year old. do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

they leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. it has ruined my outdoor rug. i took pictures. 

they drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

they regularly park in the reserved spot i pay for monthly. it is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. they are an extra $50 a month. the minute i leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until i threaten to involve the apt. manager.

they have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

they like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. i have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. it ruined my potted plants outside. 

i have reported all the incidents. i have tried to ask them to cut it out. they don't care. 

i recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out i am not the first to complain that day. the police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (i am not sure of how it was found. i stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

since then they have taken to recording me any time i leave my apartment. they have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

the woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how i am impeding her ability to exist in public because i am racist. she says i call the police on her for doing nothing. i only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

i understand i am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. i would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

i just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot i pay for monthly, and play loud music i can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

she had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

they have really upped the bleach game too. it has gotten on a few spots on my door and i am scared they might throw it at my car. 

i have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. i can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

i can't lose my job and i am not sure how protect myself legally. 

they are actually my paid space right now but i am scared to have them towed because i don't know what they are going to do. i pay for that space. i have proof. the sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

if i tell the apartment they will have the car towed but i'll look like a racist. 

all it takes is one video and a lie and i am ruined. 

i want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but i think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that i pay for is reasonable. but maybe not?",2
"boyfriend and i slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out. this happened in ontario, canada.

so this past friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

i found out about it the next night at work (i work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and i were the night before. he filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

for more context, on the 24th of october a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. it has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (i sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

all we asked for was the alarm for our unit. luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

i dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. my dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. but i don't know. came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in ontario. 

edit: more direct questions; should we pursue action and report? if we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? i know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. i could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

tldr: boyfriend and i were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

"caretaker left cat without access to water for days and died as a result. i went out of town for 5 days and a co worker offered to check on my 4 cats while i was away. i came home to find they had no food or water and their litter box hadn't been cleaned in days. my oldest girl was in really bad shape, she couldn't move her back legs at all. i thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. took her to the icu and the doctor ran a lot of tests. the doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. she was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. this caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. she suffered for two days in the icu before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. there was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering. i stayed by her side as they euthanized her. that was about 3 days ago. my heart is in pieces. 
there is no signed document of my friend agreeing to watch my cats. but i have text messages of when i tried to check in on them, then 42 messages in the morning and another 4 hours worth of messages from this friend trying to blame me for not reminding her and not telling her about an undiagnosed condition and even blaming me for trusting her.

i know i'm angry and grieving. but because of what this person did my cat suffered for days until i had to let her go.

"son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts.. this has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. we sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. his allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

we had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. we even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

so we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and i can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. he continued to adamantly deny doing that and said mrs gave them to him. 

we then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? he's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""do not worry! this won't happen again"". we have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

then, the very next school day (the meeting was on friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. we figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. we send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. we get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? he should have known to ask to begin with. we are teachers not parents.""

we have no issues for a while until this week. some parent brought in pb&j sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. he forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". we find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. he was not given this one. we spent a day at the hospital.

we've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? the school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. he gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. this is in indiana, any help is appreciated.",2
"neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. update: i'll be sure to post updates so please stop pming me or replying to my comments/post history outside of this sub asking me to do so or suggesting i shit-bomb them back. 

my wife noted that what we think might be his kid comes around most weekends. in the interest of remaining neighborly and with the possibility neighbor dude might be losing his mind, we're going to talk with them before lawyering up or involving the fuzz. updates forthcoming.

original post:
hey all, i have a shitty situation here that i'm hoping to get some advice about. this is in idaho.

&#x200b;

my neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. a new neighbor bought a house across the street about 6 months ago. a few weeks back, i was working in the garage when i saw him take his dog directly across the street, into my front yard. he let it pee in my yard and then walked straight home. he didn't notice me  - my garage is set up as a shop and is pretty busy, and the garage door is up a lot - but this piqued my interest because it's goddamned weird. now, my wife and i have a dog so there are a few dog droppings from her that we pick up on a regular basis. my wife had been doing the dooty duty recently, so i asked her if there are more piles than normal. sure enough, she said there had been a ton for a while now. she figured it was assholes walking their dogs and letting them crap in our lawn. i figured it was our new weirdo neighbor.

&#x200b;

it happened again around a week later: i was in the garage as the neighbor took his dog into our lawn. this time the dog dropped a deuce and he started to walk away without picking it up. i called out to him, asking him if he needs a plastic bag to pick up after his dog, and he avoided eye contact and scurried back home.  i went across the street and knocked on his door. he didn't answer. we set up a security camera to discretely watch the front lawn and i kept an eye out for when he was next out in his yard so i could talk to him.

&#x200b;

i reviewed the footage over the next few days and, sure enough, he was consistently taking his dog to do the deed in our yard. why our yard? no clue, we've never had any interaction with this guy whatsoever. the next time i saw him walking to his car, i confronted him. i simply told him that i knew he was taking his dog to shit in our yard and if i caught him doing it again i'd call the police to report him for trespassing. he denied doing it, claiming it must be other neighbors, got in his car, and drove away with me standing in his driveway.

&#x200b;

so i review the footage from the last few days. dude is not walking his dog into my yard anymore: he's letting the dog shit in his yard. he then scoops it up, walks it across the street, and tosses it into my yard with a shovel. what the absolute fuck.

&#x200b;

how do i even begin handling this?",2
"(update) nebraska i just closed on a new house, sellers allege that i owe a portion of their 990$ security system cancellation fee because i did not take over their contract. threatening small claims court.. https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9h80ot/nebraska_i_just_closed_on_a_new_house_sellers/?ref=share&ref_source=link

thank you to all of the people who commented on the original thread. this was my first time dealing with small claims court and all of the helpful advice and information really helped set me up for success.


so, short story is that the sellers did end up taking me to court for roughly $1,400. this was for the total cost of the contract buy out for their security system, travel expenses since they moved out of state and would need to pay for gas and lodging to come back to sue us, as well as court costs. 


small claims court was surprisingly straight forward and informal. i've never been a big talker, but i honestly don't think i was able to say more than three words at a time without the plaintiff interrupting me. the judge eventually asked her to please stand in the hall way so i could speak my side fully. she absolutely refused to leave, but did stay quiet for a short minute so i could say that i never agreed to take over her security contract, and there was no documentation to suggest that i did.


the judge agreed and ended up ruling in my favor. i thought it was done there but the plaintiff swiftly appealed the decision. so now we had a new court date early this month with a different judge. 


during this time the plaintiff continues to send me hostile emails and voice messages. the seller's broker (their realtors boss) called me while i was at work to tell me he was very displeased i filed a formal complaint against his realtor. he told me i was not welcome to pursue any future business with his company, and i assured him the feeling was mutual. the broker said he supports all of his realtors and will not be acting on the complaint in any way. so i went and talked to the mayor's office about the situation. the mayor asked me what i wanted out of this, and i showed him the hostile emails from the seller and told him i felt it was the realtor's job to act as an in-between, even after the sell was complete. the mayor said he would step in and speak with the broker. (this is a fairly small town, they probably already knew each other). 


i never heard from the seller again after that, thanks mayor. so now it comes time for round 2 in small claims court. the new judge goes through and reads the write up from round 1 and asked the plaintiff if there is new evidence or information that has not been covered. long story short, there was not. the judge ended up sustaining the previous ruling in my favor, and strongly advised the plaintiff not to appeal unless there is new evidence or information that has not been seen by the court.


it's been five days and no word on an appeal so i think it's safe to say i'm finally done and ready to put this whole ugly thing behind me. once again thank you to all of you who helped me on the original thread. i'm very pleased that resources like this community exist.


on a final note, gossip, but i got a call from the mayor at 2am the night before last because there was a house fire down the street from me. (the mayor and i know each other well). so i went to go help the volunteer fire brigade put it out. we got it under control and we were winding down when a deputy from the sheriff's office comes to tell me that the lady who sued me waited around the court building the day of the appeal for the judge to get off, then tried to confront him about the ruling in the courthouse parking lot. i didn't really care to hear about it, but it sounds like she's in some pretty deep shit now. kind of cathartic.


tl;dr: they lost and i think it's finally over.

edit: thank you for all of the very kind and thoughtful messages! to clarify some common questions, the ruling stipulated that the plaintiff pays all court costs, including my own. yes, i could probably countersue, but i'm very interested in dealing with the seller and broker as little as possible for the rest of my life. :)

please do not take this post as a representation of nebraska, most people here are actually quite nice. there's a couple rotten apples in every bunch.",2
"police broke into my home because my child cried during the night while i was asleep. this has been a really weird morning... not sure if i chose the correct flair

i have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. he sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. i put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. around 3am i got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. she gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.

at 6:30am i am awoken by a single low knocking sound. i get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point i usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more z's). as i exit my room i am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. i dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if i should serve them a drink. one cop asks me who i am to which i reply with my full name and ask what is going on. he continues his interrogation, asking if i live with a woman. fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. i answer that i live with my girlfriend. the cop asks me if i have a son to which i reply yes. he asks me where he is. at this point i lean over the wall and i see my door busted upen. i am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so i look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. i see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop ""he is there, what is going on!?"" the tell me to step out into the dining room and i put my hands up as i walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. i sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. i look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex i live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.

 the cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. he says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. he claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. they never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. my apartment has weird acoustics and i cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.

he asks me why i didnt hear him and i told him i must have been deeply asleep. he asks if i am under the influence of drugs and i say i just went to bed late because i was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. as the cops leave i could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. the cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. i asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. i asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...

so now i am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. i fear when i go outside i'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.

i have been trying to understand the timeline of events. i went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. if the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. my son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. the cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the ""detonatios"" not a crying child. my son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.

is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? what about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? was that just an excuse to burst in? he sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.

"update: landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. good news!. well, here's my update! and with good news!

so first of all, i just wanted to say: wow. the amount of support i received, both in replies and in pms, was absolutely amazing. everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. the person who said ""sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

that said - i feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). he's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. he grew up in rural (arkansas, i think? that or alabama) and came to ma later in life. this was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. that, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

i know some of you were hoping i'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, i decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

yesterday i sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. he realized very quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. he also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. he just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

we ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if i weren't having the conversation with him i'd think he were a caricature). he's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so i think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". he seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. i reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

he still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. he seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. he agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which i will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

the past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. if things go well, i might even potentially renew the lease come september. i'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but i think i'll leave the issue where it lies for now. if this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, i'll go at him with everything i can in the future - but for now i'm satisfied. i'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",2
"mn a girl is planning to claim i am the father of her baby when we never had sex. i've been living in a foster home since january '18. i turn 15 in march. the foster parent if you want to call her that is a woman with a weight and alcohol problem who loves to yell. she blames me for getting her daughter pregnant who is 22 and lives here. i never had sex with her, and i would choose death if it were a choice between that and having sex with her. unless she somehow raped me without me remembering it, it's not mine, but she's going to put me down as the father anyway. the foster ""parent"" claims teenage boys can't control their hormones so it must have been me.

i can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court. i said i would go to the doctor with her and get a paternity test, and she thinks i will falsify it by giving someone else's semen sample. she is trying to gaslight me into believing something that never happened, probably because the real father is a real loser like her.",2
"nsw australia. last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. i jumped out because i'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. i now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.. long time la reader here, and i'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. when i'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.

early in november we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend i'll call aaron (because his name's aaron and i think he's being an idiot) had bought on ebay. we had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.

it'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. i'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. there was no way i'd go through the water as it looked, but because i'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river i didn't want to risk it. i didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. i said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

aaron decided to push on and started moving and i panicked and got straight out. it was far more water than i'd had to go through when i near lost my car and life before. i got out well before the water though so i didn't let water in the car btw.

aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. he was extremely lucky not to drown, and i ran down & helped him out. immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. admittedly i'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of ebay parts in the back so it's not like i'd have made much difference.

we phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. we haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. but on friday i received a letter from a lawyer i know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. it's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because i made the car unsafe by getting out. it was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

i think he's being a dickhead. someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? ideally i'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what i think they'll be. i want to contact his lawyer to tell them aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should i get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

i promised an update so here it is. first off, i want to thank everyone who strongly suggested i go see a doctor asap. i went to see an ent and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. my hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. the tinnitus was still quite bad, so i wanted to see if the doc could help with that. he put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. i saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (this was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

the ringing has gone down considerably, and i'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. it still bothers me at night and while i'm trying to work sometimes. the biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so i haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. this has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point i'm far too behind schedule to complete it.

my uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. i'm not planning on suing him. he knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what i was going through. my aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. i haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. they have offered to call me and apologize but i don't want to talk to them. i just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. i'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but i don't care. fuck that guy. thanks for hearing my story and for all the advice.",2
"update ex is saying that she lives with me and that i'm abusive, police kicked me out of my own house. i went to the police station with my ex's(the mother of my child) parents with proof of my ownership of the house, drivers license, my taxes(to show my filing status), and video of her breaking in. they brought her mail that was addressed to their house, not mine. i threw a fit and essentially told them to get her out of my house or else i was going to sue(i have no idea if i actually can or not but it seemed scary enough). i showed them my bruises and scratches from her attacking me and eventually they relented. we went to my house, i let them in, and they went to remove her. they arrested her, cps is now involved, and i'm on my way to a lawyer consultation. thanks for all the help everyone. hopefully this will be my last update. 

sorry for updating twice. i misread the bots instructions, deleted, tried to post it in bola, didn't work, and just reposted it here. ",2

"kicked our at 16. parents took all my money.. i had posted this on other subs and was told to post here. 16f.

three nights ago my parents and i got in a huge fight. i am not a christian. they are extreme bible thumpers. i am bisexual, they believe i'm going to be burning in hell. i was forced to come out of the closet due to blackmail reasons, and my parents promptly kicked me out. 

i managed to get my dogs and my keys, took my car and left. we just moved to this state so i have no friends. my siblings all have the same beliefs as my parents. my related family is all thousands of miles away. last night, my parents cut off my phone plan and told me they're kicking me off of their insurance. right now i am on my own with my two large dogs, pitbull and american bulldog, sleeping in my car. my parents forced me to quit my job last week so i could focus more on school. last night i checked my bank account. my parents drained the 1k savings i had in it. it is completely empty. 

i'm just scared and don't know where to turn. i primarily want to be able to take care of my dogs. i do not want to give them up but i'm not sure how much longer i can without neglecting them. giving them up would be out of absolute desperation. i will not give up on them easily. having them around has protected me from many bad situations. 

i live in tennessee. any advice would be helpful. 

i also do not want to return home. my mother is abusive. dcs has seen physical evidence of abuse (black eye, bloody scratch marks, bruises) and placed me back in the home. they are useless.",2
"work punishments include drinking soap and other abuse. my girlfriend works at a retail store in california. they are supposed to ask customers if they want to buy a particular item and there is a punishment board for not doing so. the employee is allowed to choose their punishment from a punishment board.

the punishments are either very hard and often demeaning work or obviously illegal punishments. the hard work is things like cleaning toilets or moving heavy objects. other punishments include doing pushups, coworkers being allowed to hit you with a stick, drinking soap, eating dog food, and sucking on undesirable objects that are not meant for human consumption.

is this illegal? they could argue these obviously illegal punishments are not mandatory, but there is an incentive to do them because the other punishments are so difficult.",2

update 2.5: there's been lots of debate about whether the sling is allowed or not. aa told me: 1) yes, medical devices are allowed. 2) i am protected under acaa and ada. 3) technically on aa you don't need to always make a ""special request"" to allow the device. in most cases, you can just tell the crew that it's a medical device and they should understand. but for extra safety it helps to make a note on your profile about it. 4) there should be no obstructive items in the way during takeoff and landing. however this particular aa representative said that the sling is ""not an obstructive item"".

amazon link for the curious: https://amzn.to/36xbjy3


update 2: aa called me, apologized for the fa ""escalating out of control"". they will open an internal investigation. i conveyed that i don't want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. 😞 but that it's up to aa to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. i don't want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. 

she assured me that i won't get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me. 

**i did not ask for compensation and told her that i'm not here on a vengeance.** not here to make money or fame from aa. nope. did not make a dime from this and don't plan to. i will not be responding to media inquiries. https://imgflip.com/i/3f8i7p 

for those of you calling me obese and telling me to die - i'm a 120lb girl lol. i injured my foot and was hospitalized thus the sling. 

forgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. it's just that i talked back (""no i don't but okay"") and i regret that so much. 

halloween is over but she spooked me to the core. 

someone asked if it's a racial thing. i'm not white but it's probably not a related to race. 

many of you guys advised not to delete the post and keep it here in case this happens to someone else and they need answers. hope this helps.

update 1: thank you so much for your quick advice on a sunday morning! i memorized some of the lines you wrote below.

as we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija

""the police will contact you when you get home. you will be banned from future flights."" 

""ok."" 

""oh i hope so."" as she walked away. 

i burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. she won. 

there was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my miranda rights. i made it home in one piece. still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future aa flights. i've been an emotional wreck and can't stop crying. my thanksgiving and holiday flights are both on aa. 

my seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. they gave me their business card in case i need a witness. 

thank you again for your helpful comments. i am not in jail (yet) at least!

original post: 

i can't believe this is happening to me. i'm flying from chicago to boston now and police are waiting for me when i land, so i don't have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

edit: i've looked all over the internet and can't find any faa rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

here's what happened:

..

i was on an american airlines flight from chicago to boston on november 3rd, 2019. because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, i use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. this sling is often advertised on facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. i am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

""you have to put your feet on the ground!"" i cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

""no i don't but okay."" as i put my feet down. emphasizing again. **i complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** although i had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights i've taken with my foot sling, i complied. i put my feet down immediately. 

even if it's technically not allowed by some rule i'm not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

she immediately escalated: 
""would you like to go back to the gate? we're gonna go back to the gate!"" and immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

but right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

she came back to my seat and barked: 
""police will be waiting for you when we land in boston.""

my seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. i had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, ""no i don't but okay"" are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

her statement caused me to panic inside. i'm now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

so i took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight. 

am i fucked?",2
"my niece's (5) school allowed a person to visit her at lunch and bring her a drink, all without this person being on the list of people my sister (26) approved to have contact with her.. located in oklahoma, usa

my sister and i have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. my niece told my sister about it when she got home. my sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. so they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. 

the principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. the only thing i can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? they risked my niece's safety and i think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but i'm not sure what could be done.

update: my sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. the board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. the school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution. thank you to the people who were helpful!",2
"update i'm pregnant and being investigated by dcs.. here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5smsoi/indiana_im_pregnant_and_being_investigated_by_dcs/) is my original post. when i made it, i was advised to get a lawyer right away. i was also advised that indiana's dcs doesn't investigate pregnant women who don't already have kids, and that the woman claiming to be a social worker might be an imposter.

i contacted and met with a lawyer, and explained the situation to him. he seemed to agree that something was very fishy. to make a long story short, the woman ""handling our case"" has no affiliation with dcs. 

i'm still in complete shock.

we went straight to the police. they're taking this very seriously. i can't give a lot of details because it's an ongoing investigation, but she seems to have been a very skilled/well-researched liar. i never would have known anything was amiss without the advice of this subreddit and the intervention of my attorney. i feel like a complete idiot, but the instinct to cooperate unquestioningly when faced with an intimidating ""authority figure"" is strong.

i haven't had the baby yet. we're staying at a trusted family member's home until the baby is born. my ob and the hospital we'll be delivering at have already been informed of the situation, and will be taking the appropriate security measures. i'm still freaking out, but we're taking every precaution for the safety of my child, and hopefully everything will turn out okay.

"returned a $1,175 computer back to walmart and they refuse to refund the money.. hi all! so i put a gaming comp on layaway with walmart a few weeks ago so i could make payments versus $1,000+ at once. 

i finally paid it off brought it home, and the motherboard was cracked. so i returned it, unfortunately they said that amount was too much for a gift card (as i was going to immediately buy a new one) but my mom has a walmart debit card they said it would be available to me immediately. 

well it immediately locked her account for fraud, so we called the walmart money people and they said all we needed to do was submit the receipt as proof. 

we did and called back and the lady said that the receipt wasn't good enough?? she said that it had a ""different balance"" on all the receipts but that's because it was layaway and i made payments! 

she told my mother the account may never be unlocked as we did not have sufficient proof? 

i'm totally distraught, i'm a college student and i don't have extra funds this was something i worked hard for. 

any and all advice is welcome i'm desperate. i am in the us, specifically florida

edit: i understand now, walmart was not the best place to buy the pc, i get it. the reason i did was so i could make payments the way i wanted. hindsight is 20/20 ",2
"my daughter left daycare and ran into the street and nobody noticed until a stranger found her. (wi) just started work for the first time since having my daughter two years ago. 

left her at a daycare with a group size of 11 and 3 care providers. 

on the second day i was driving and saw her walking down the street several blocks from the daycare with a woman i had never seen before in my life. 

i jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she'd found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (i have no reason to doubt the woman's intentions because there was a police station on this road.) 

i drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.

i was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a good samaritan that i just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her. 

this occurred on friday and i have yet to receive a response. i would like to know if i can take legal action against them for endangering  my daughter and if i can alert the other parents as to what occurred so they can keep their little ones safe, without opening myself up to slander charges. thanks.

"told that my eight hour shift is now thirty six hours and i'll be fired if i fall asleep. washington. like the title says. i work at a 24-hour post as a security guard and we are majorly understaffed.

my boss tells me there was a call-off and could i please show up at 10am tomorrow to work 10-10. i agreed. 

my boss went home and called me two hours into my shift to tell me my relief would not be showing and that he couldn't find a replacement. 

i told him i could either work overnight or pull a 12 tomorrow, but i cannot work 32 hours straight and safely drive home. 

i also have a medical condition i need to take medication for and a missed dose will give me debilitating withdrawal symptoms. 


my boss informed me that he was going to bed and would be turning off his phone. 


it's 11:30pm and i've tried contacting everyone up the chain. nobody has so much as an estimate as to when i can go home- they're all asleep or punting the problem to someone else (who is asleep). 

if i leave, i'll be fired. if i fall asleep, i'll be fired. 

what's my best move?

edit: it turns out what my bosses are doing isn't illegal but i seriously doubt they'll fire me when it means they'll be down three workers instead of two. 

i've informed the only person i can reach (my direct supervisor) that i'll be leaving at a set time, whether they've found a replacement or not.

second edit: i got my supervisors spoken permission to go home and take my meds/eat, and unspoken permission to curl up on the dirty floor someplace off camera to sleep. 

job hunt starts tomorrow.

"exwife is going off the deep end. this is in nj, usa. can i do anything here?. i get my daughter every other weekend. she's 9 years old and her mother bought her a cell phone, obviously to keep tabs on my daughter. 

this weekend, we were watching a movie when i got a text from my ex wife asking to speak to my daughter. 

now, i don't attach myself to my phone (unless i'm working) and i got the text about 30 minutes after it came through. 

when i saw it, i told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and i also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that i told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

the movie ended around 9:10 pm and i had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. i told her i'd be up to tuck her in. 

i went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. 

he mother was screaming into the phone ""you tell him fuck you! you can say that! i say its ok for you to tell your father fuck you!!""

i took the phone from my daughter and i said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

she yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn't true at all. 

i asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. my ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

i handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear ""daddy is going to leave the room now, please don't stay on the phone long, it's way past your bedtime."" (bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was saturday night so i bent the bedtime a bit). 

i had to get my stepson to bed (he's a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

i walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she's repeating ""i'm sorry"" into the phone. i fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

i walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

it wasn't until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. she had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

i sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. she was really upset and wouldn't speak much. i hugged her. my daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. 

i'm sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. divorce is hard enough on children, and i think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be.

"update: hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. building management's negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (to, canada). link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

first i want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and i are quite happy with. i've been very active on reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. it has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. i digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

through the advice i received on this subreddit, i contacted the city and the health department right away. i was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. the more we spoke the more interested he became. he called and asked me ""if i were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would i be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?"" to which i replied ""150%"". he then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, i said ""no."" 

shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. i went out and asked them why. they told me they were instructed to because they don't want people panicking etc. i told them they were to leave it there as i have called the city and they are on their way. they didn't seem happy. as if the whole floor isn't already in a panic anyway. literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. i also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. i have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. this lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

i explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. according to toronto health and bylaws that is bullshit. the situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. the bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information i have been receiving from the building management. 

the bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. i heard nothing until monday. come monday morning i get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. they will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. the cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. i'm guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

the city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. i do not believe them at all. we have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they ""didn't know"" and will be handing it over. from what i understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. i have the personal contact information for the officer i spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. we went from ""submit a maintenance request"" to ""we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately"" in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

thank you so much reddit!!! i couldn't have done it without your help!! 

here is hoping the next few months continues on a more upward trajectory. ",2
"police took my minor son and questioned him alone for 9 hours and didnt allow us to see him or speak to him. this happened last week, he's only 11. at around 10am my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.

they then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. the biggest issue is no one called us. not the school, not the police no one. we got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1pm).

we called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. we start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iphone and seen where he was and we headed there.

we got there at maybe 1:15pm and were completely stonewalled. no one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. he spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing nerf guns (this is important later).

we continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. she wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30pm and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7pm. they did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

we get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. they never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""creepers"" from their minecraft game. they painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

when they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. we've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

they kept offering him mcdonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. they asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. they kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

the school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. we can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. what the hell do we do?

edit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords.",2
"ne & co my mom wants to have me ""repossessed"" from college and taken home by force over state lines. can she do that?. for some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. she has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since i've moved out for college. she demands access to absolutely everything i have. this will be important later.

&#x200b;

i'm 18 years old, and i'm a college freshman. i go to college in colorado, but i was born and raised in nebraska. in nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. it was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. like i said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when i do things that are outside of her reach.

&#x200b;

my mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. email, whatsapp, facebook (even though i haven't used it in years), twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if i don't give it to her. in the past, i've rolled over and taken it. it was a survival mechanism more than anything. if i'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. she justifies this by claiming that because i have autism, i can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200b;

about a month ago, i changed all my passwords. sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that i need to give her my new passwords. i tell her no. this is where trouble begins.

over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. she's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. a week ago, she showed up here and i had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. that pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200b;

recently, though, as in last night, i was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" i asked her to clarify and she said that because i'm still a minor in nebraska, and i'm a resident of nebraska, i have to abide by nebraska's laws and as such, i am still a minor and she can do that. i wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like i wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as i've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. it's not nice. i do not want to be gooned and taken home. i don't want to face my mother again.

&#x200b;

so the question is this: can she do that? is the fugitive slave act not dead after all? does my having autism change the circumstances any? if all else fails, what can i do to protect myself?",2
"(va) my son stole a rare toy from my brother. my brother is refusing to take it back and is threatening to get the police involved. what do i do?. right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. here is the story.

&#x200b;

last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. while we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. my brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what i know it's one of his biggest hobbies. well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

&#x200b;

well, until yesterday. my brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and i needed to return it immediately. i honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a boba fett figure from his collection. he confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.

&#x200b;

i was furious and took it from him. here is the problem though, after i confirmed with my brother it was his i found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. so my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. i told him i would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. 

&#x200b;

honestly, what are my options here? i can't afford to pay him back right now. if he does go the police will my son get arrested? he's only 15. it was very wrong of him to do but i think my brother is over reacting. what can i expect if he does take me to court or call the police?",2
"(ohio) woman sent me video of her setting my priceless painting (family heirloom) on fire because i called cps on her. my boyfriend's sister in law abuses and over medicated her autistic child so i called child protective services on her months ago. i was living up there near his family and long story short, when i drove home for the holidays (was just supposed to be a short trip but all hell broke loose and my boyfriend quickly packed everything we owned and followed me down a few days later) he forgot this one painting that has been in the family for over 100 years and my grandfather gave it to me before he died 14 years ago. she and her husband sent me a video saying ""this is for calling cps, bitch."" they're both clearly seen in the video and called it a priceless painting. 

do i have any ground to sue or press charges? i wanted to see if anyone here might have advice before i go and shell out my savings for a lawyer. this was literally my most prized possession and my heart is in so many pieces because my grandfather gave it to me so long ago. i would give everything i own just to get it back. i'm living in florida and this is all in ohio.

"bored middle age neighbor has been giving me a hard time because i dress like a ""hussy"", is that a crime?. i have been accused of a litany of sexual crimes, some against children because of the way i dress. my neighbor is so adamant about all of this she's got me a bit worried. 

about a month ago, i moved in with my sister and her boyfriend into a neighborhood that's mostly families. i didn't expect any trouble. my first introduction to this woman, let's call her karen, was my first week here. i went to check the mail and i wasn't wearing a bra. i had on a baggy t shirt and basketball shorts, though. karen is one of *those* southern women who spend all day in their yards, pretending to garden, but are really spying on their neighbors. you know the type. she waved at me and i waved back, trying to be pleasant. she came at me, i thought to make a proper introduction, or whatever, but she started lecturing me about not having on a bra.

it was creepy and weird. i am not at all well endowed, i go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not karen. karen urged me to think of her children and jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. it was so goddamn weird, i felt like laughing in her face, but i didn't want there to be issues so i said i'd be more diligent in the future and karen went about her business.

well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for karen, y'all, oh no. not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. while my breasts are small and humble, i am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

the second time karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. she threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated i got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a jezebel and that i needed jesus. because i was wearing jean shorts.

we live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and i like to go out for walks, but it seems every time i step foot out of my door, there's fucking karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. it's getting annoying. 

this is in florida, by the way.

edit: i got dressed up in my skimpiest daisy dukes that barely cover my ass and a legit camel toe, a half shirt with no bra on, my abs exposed to check the mail (i do not regularly dress like this) i must have been quite a sight to karen who immediately stormed over once she spotted me, nearly knocking over her lawn chair she stood up so fast. she started laying into me. i just stood there letting her bump her gums for a minute then i said ""you can stop the games, karen. i see the way you look at me, i know you want me."" her face went beet red and she stammered out, ""i'll pray for you."" then scurried away. actually went inside her house. 😂",2

well, i took y'alls advice and went back to the restaurant, i spent about an hour and a half waiting and then speaking with a shift manager who called the general manager who called the owner, and they swore up and down that no one had come to ask for a tape or anything of the sort. 

then i started looking for defense attorneys but i wasn't sure exactly how to proceed, honestly this week i've been mortified and really on edge. finally when i told my friends about everything one of them fessed up to the fact that it was actually them and they made it up as some kind of prank. pretty twisted joke, i wasn't laughing. i'm pretty pissed and seriously reconsidering my relationship with him. i appreciate everyone's support, excluding the people who made fun of my mother's death or tried to figure out where i lived.

"my mom's defibrillator malfunctioned and shocked her 40+ times at 600v. the doctor's all denied responsibility for the cause. it put my parents hundreds of thousands of dollars into medical debt.. location: us. original incident happened in indiana.

i should first and foremost say that this happened about 10 years ago, so at this point i doubt it's possible to do anything about the situation.

&#x200b;

when i was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. she thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. this led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. it turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

&#x200b;

it could be some form of ptsd i suffered from seeing my mom nearly die in my arms, but her defibrillator almost triggered again today and it brought back those memories. she told me that her and my dad tried to pinpoint who was responsible (the company who made the wires, the defibrillator company, etc.) but all of the doctors she saw denied responsibility.

is there anything they can do at this point? i feel like she suffered so much and was given absolutely zero compensation for what happened. it makes me furious knowing how much pain she went through and nothing was done about it.",2
"a male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. he just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists.. spa is in maryland. a friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it's ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. he is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. he has not spoken with management yet. he just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

minor update: i advised him of his many options after reading the comments. he went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

i'm guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. the mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room. 

thank you everyone for the comments. if this  issue comes up again he will be going over their heads to handle this legally. ",2
"new york- mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while i was babysitting 4 year old step sister. hi folks

i'm a 21 year old college student. my parents separated soon after i was born, and my my mom raised me alone until i was 15. she met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister eliza. she's grown up with me, and i often baby sit for her for short periods of time. i live with a roomate in apartments owned by the college

late last week, my stepfather's mom died. he's polish, so my mom and he left for poland leaving me to babysit eliza for a week. yesterday, i got a call from my stepfather's sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in poland. i've tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it's starting to sink in that this is real

i have no idea what to do. my biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. my mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the usa that i am aware of. i'm studying political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but i have no job and no salary. 

eliza has no family other than me that i can turn to. i'm not ready to take of a child, but i also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she's my little sister, and i've been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. but we also look very different- my dad is jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. so i'm a tall, mixed race dude while eliza is a small blonde girl (i bring this up because i was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn't get sorted out till my mom showed up).

so what do i do? i'm barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and i haven't even told eliza yet. it just hit me that we're now alone, and i now have to step up to the plate and take care of eliza. i have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

edit: thank you for all you advice. i apologize if i do not respond to your post- got a lot to deal with right now

edit 2: thank you to everybody who has offered to send me financial support. however, i am currently ok, and my mom's friends, and my college friends have kindly offered to help me out, and i also have a little bit saved up. but i greatly appreciate your generosity",2
"my daughter (7) keeps getting touched inappropriately at school, school brushing it off (washington). on a near daily basis, my daughter (age 7) is getting groped by a boy at school.  she says he typically does it when the class is lining up and when the teacher is not looking, or at recess.  so far he has touched her butt, her chest, and proclaimed ""we should have sex.""

we talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  this has not helped.  we escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

the principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""  the read between the lines comment was: ""the boy's parents are not taking the issue seriously.""  the principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

we are really fed up that the situation is allowed to keep occurring and that our daughter does not feel safe.  it shouldn't be up to my daughter to ""cause a scene"" when it happens.  what obligation (if any) does the school have to try and correct this issue?",2

"us, ok disgruntled neighbor has installed a strobe light to stop epileptic kids from using a school bus stop.. to give some context on where we live: we're in a small neighborhood of about 5 homes; it's a very small cul-de-sac area in the middle of farmland. there aren't other homes or buildings for about 2 miles.

i have 3, young, elementary aged children that all have a very serious case of epilepsy: it does not take much to cause an episode. by some luck, two of our neighbor's kids also have epilepsy, and are also around the same age as our kids. for the past few years they have been able to successfully group together and go to the end of our community to catch the bus.

the family who used to own the house at the street recently moved out, and there is a new owner who has been an absolute hell to everyone. from the second day on, he has harassed our kids telling them to get off his property, even though they were technically on a public road. through the grapevine he somehow learned that a majority of the kids were epileptic, and has installed strobe lights in his front lawn. these are very powerful, very fast lights that you can not avoid walking by.

we've contacted the police, and they won't even come out to talk to the guy. we've contacted the school to see if they could come into the neighborhood to pick up our kids, and they really can't: the bus just couldn't drive into our neighborhood and easily back out. they have to be picked up on the street.

what can we do?

"(update) school wants my son's facebook password & email, also wants us to hand over any phone or computer that he's had access to in the last year. wtf? florida. this is an update to this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pcmwx/school_wants_my_sons_facebook_password_email_also/).

i went to school and asked what's going on. i did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

first, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. second, the principal explained the situation to me. it had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

when i asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. i asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

i told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. i told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat i'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

i talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. he only knew that she had left the school. he showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

in short: they backed off after i made sure they understood that i won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. i will try talking to them to make sure. they deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at.

"update: old coworkers are telling me my old boss talks to them about ""all the issues i'm having."" found out my therapist is my old boss's husband. (mn). original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/anlpqr/old_coworkers_are_telling_me_my_old_boss_talks_to/)

&#x200b;

**old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that i was having a ton of issues. i found out my therapist is her husband, but i didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200b;

**new developments summary**: there's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. i even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200b;

**new developments, continued**: therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). i have a very peculiar family dynamic, so i think he talked about that. however, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that i was depressed and had family issues. neat. one of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200b;

**resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than i thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. i don't know if he'll practice again.

"i suspect my step-mom attempted to poison my dying dad's food. i managed to procure specimen in question. what do i do now?. not sure if this is the right subreddit. sorry for the wall of text, but my head is spinning and i don't know what to do. let me break down some background first:

&#x200b;

my dad is currently dying of liver failure. he's in end-stage, at-home hospice care.  we have nurses and social workers that visit every single day in the hospital bed we set up to help care and clean him up. the man is incontinent and can barely move unassisted. he's taking light doses of morphine and lorazepam so that he can sleep. the consensus seems to be that he'll be lucky to make to thanksgiving....

&#x200b;

my step-mom has a very shady history....she has three dead husbands  prior to my dad from whom she collects monthly in the sums of many thousands combined.  there was a fourth man after that she got engaged to after a mere 6 months, who died under mysterious circumstances, and she fought to take as many of his valuable possessions from under the noses of his children as she could. (my dad would be the 5th man)

she's euthanized 2 of her own dogs and 1 of her own cats....herself. not through any vet or other official. she is barred from every animal shelter and adoption agency in the state as a result.

so with that pre-established pattern in mind....let me bring you to last night.

&#x200b;

she brought in a ""home-made"" tuna fish sandwich to feed my dad, because he barely eats anymore, and it's somewhat of a thrill when he requests something. he was lucid and alert, laughing and joking. in a matter of less than a minute after devouring half the sandwich, he began to have the most extreme reaction i've ever seen him have:  his eyes rolled back, he began to seriously convulse, let out a series of loud groans and moans....his face contorted, and he was completely unresponsive to all outside stimuli - lights, loud voices, touch, you name it. before i even put two and two together, she's asking him (a little too enthusiastically) ""do you see the light yet??? do you see all the pretty angels??"" (wtf????). he's been in an essentially catatonic state since. out cold for the past 12 hours. it was a transformation that happened mid-sentence as he was speaking. in tears, i begged him to squeeze my hand if he could hear me, but....no dice. i was truly scared and genuinely thought i was going to lose him right then and there. we called hospice to send a nurse over (instead of calling 911, which is what we've been instructed to do. they are on staff 24/7). she wasn't sure what the catalyst for this episode was, but she did say that his vitals were okay and that this is a normal part of the dying process, and that if anything, we will be seeing things like this more often, and that it could also possibly be the drugs.

but he's been on them for weeks, at low, very controlled doses, and nothing like this has ever happened. i'm just a lay person, but that did not seem normal, and it's very suspicious to me that it happened immediately following the food, like flipping a light switch.

maybe i'm crazy. maybe i'm reading too much into it.  but i managed to wrap up the other half of the sandwhich in plastic wrap, and keep it refridgerated. my first thought is to get it analyzed in some lab somewhere....but....where? is that even a thing? do i take it to the police and tell them my suspicions? a hospital?

with him being in the dying stage already, is it even worth pursuing??

&#x200b;

again, if it weren't  for this woman's history, i probably wouldn't think anything of it....

&#x200b;

any and all feedback would be much appreciated. i'll do my best to answer any questions as well. ",2
"minnesota: landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. what now?. for some background i am renting an apartment and my lease ends on september 30th. my landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. i do have a lease that says i get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which i believe is the law itself, but in this case i did not get that notice.

last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8am saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). he asked if i could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing i'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

i did not see these messages until i took lunch at 12. i texted my landlord back saying i thought i am supposed to get notice for entry and i'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though i'm sure that doesn't legally count).

long story short they robbed me and i have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. they took everything of value such as laptop and tv and even some stupid things like my lamps.

my renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and i should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. he met them at dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. i told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place i would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

what now? push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? i would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.",2

when i confronted him he became aggressive with me, made threatening gestures toward me and started trying to accuse me of wrongfully occupying the building, which is not the case. he then left the property and came back 20 minutes later and started banging on the door and threatening me and accusing me of wrongfully occupying the space again. and when i explained to him that i had every right to be there because i had permission from the tenant to be there, he said ""okay, i'll let you go this time."" 

my girlfriend feels uncomfortable here because he just entered the unit without her permission. how can we make sure he doesn't do this again?

"update: i am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents. my step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses. can someone help me please?. i posted this a few weeks ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i\_am\_supposed\_to\_have\_money\_put\_aside\_for\_me\_for/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i_am_supposed_to_have_money_put_aside_for_me_for/)

i just wanted to say thank you to all the advice and help i received (especially derspiny). i was able to get in touch with an awesome lawyer who specializes in wills and trusts, who after explaining my whole situation to him he was willing to do the discovery for free.

he was able to find that i not only have 1 trusts, but 2 trusts for me. one of the trusts was setup a long time ago, most likely by my mother and is still intact and safe (which was more than enough for me). unfortunately the second trust was most likely ""improperly setup or handled"", as it seems to have been emptied about 2 years ago.

he gave me a bunch more useful advice and gave me detailed instructions on how to use the trust properly, along with a bunch of recommendations to ensure the money is not touched by my step mother or siblings.

i also managed to talk to my step siblings and basically learned that:

* they both considered themselves estranged from my step mother, my older step brother pays for her utilities/rent but that is it. they aren't on speaking terms in anyway, and recommended me to get out right away.
* apparently my step sister also was supposed to have a bunch of money for her education only for it to mysteriously just dry up after her first year of university. with her  mom telling her she spent all her 4 years of tuition in 1 year. so now she is paying her way. 

anyways i have decided to basically keep my head down for the last year of high school and get out as soon as university starts, and never look back.

thank you so much for your help.",2
"update ga just moved into a condo, neighbor is raising hell over my nonexistent pet bird.  original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8chp37/ga_just_moved_into_a_condo_neighbor_is_tasing/)

tl;dr of previous post\- my next door neighbor is absolutely convinced i have a pet bird and has made complaints to the hoa, animal control, and the police because my supposed pet bird is so loud it is causing emotional distress.

i got another complaint from the head guy running the hoa that my \(now multiple\) birds are causing severe emotional distress to my neighbors and their children, who can't sleep at night because of my ""flock"" of birds. the wife sent a recording to him as proof of my bird\(s\), and to tell him to tell me my smoke alarm is also beeping and needs the batteries replaced because they can hear it from their unit as well. 

now, you can clearly hear a smoke alarm beeping, as well as birds chirping on the recording. however, the beeping is coming from their unit, as i can faintly hear it if i press my ear to the shared wall. and the birds that are supposedly my pets? the ones that are so loud that their whole household can't sleep and it's causing severe emotional distress? those are the birds outside. it's literally the chirping of the birds outside they're hearing. now, i'm no disney princess, so i have no effect on wild birds\- or imaginary pet birds\- for that matter. i mean, my singing is so terrible it actually scares them away.  and i'm not sure how any person that is not a complete moron would mistake ordinary bird chirping for ""a flock of loud, abused rain forest birds"".

i've sent a letter to the hoa telling them to kindly pound sand and stop harassing me over the wild birds that i have no control over. i'm also going to record the birds from my porch and from inside the condo so if they say i have birds again i can prove that it's just ordinary outside birds making reasonable outside bird noises.  i'm looking into get a bird feeder as well, because it's allowed by the hoa covenants and fuck these people for being utter imbeciles and blaming me for the natural behaviour of wild animals. 

now i'm just going to sit and wait for the next problem they have with me,  because i don't think these nitwits will take kindly to being proven wrong over something so stupid.",2
"update this man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, i have a specific question regarding something i want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it.. i would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). sorry for not updating you right away as i was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

so here's what happened. i liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone's day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. so i hired a guy which i'll call him frank.

after waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid's drone and frank's drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

a few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom i recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. we went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. shockingly he was completely understanding. he told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both frank and i a settlement if i agree not to sue. i called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed frank for his drone plus way more money that i would've ever paid him. he also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that i wont pursue any legal action.

it was a happy ending and i was quite shocked of his father's reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but i must admit that i feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. never have i felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. while we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! so the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like ""mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and i'll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away"".",2
"tsa detained, roughly handled my terminally ill father and his port, causing us to go to the er and possibly miss out on experimental treatment.. i'm going to try to state this as calmly as possibly.

my father has cancer, walks with a cane/wheelchair, and has a port(https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/cdr756805-750.jpg) for his treatments that is a tube from the side of his chest going to his heart.  we came to this country 20 years ago, both my parents speak english well with an accent that is not so thick people have difficulty understanding them in our city (new york) facing the customer directly at our shop. they sometimes get syntaxes, plurals, and slang wrong, but it's not hard to figure out, my father read the times daily and has given lectures at a college. i'll gladly post an audio clip of them speaking if needed. however, the cancer and medication make him very soft spoken, and his hearing isn't that great (he's nearly 70) and when very upset or flustered, can have a hard time finding the right words. 
 

today, they were flying from tn (i don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to houston, tx, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   he had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (brooklyn, ny) and in texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which i will request from his doctors tomorrow)  he also brings a printout from the tsa about traveling with a port and cancer which i will find the exact link to when i get more info.  

my parents arrive 3:45 to a tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
both parents have tsa pre and get on line at about 4. they are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  the agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the id, etc.  my father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. meanwhile i assume he is not speaking his best english, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. i'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which i think adds to the confusion. they wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. they don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  they go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   my father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  he calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  he tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (his first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) they take him into a small room away from my mother. he is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  the agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. the agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  my father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed his parents and most of his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  i have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. he couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

he tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115-25 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) the agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   the agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. my father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  they bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  they wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  they agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  they take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. he asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. by this point the plane has left.  they go to the er to see if port is damaged and for pain medication.

he has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  my father is in incredible, needless pain, in a strange city hospital.  port is ok but they want to check him out again before flying.

i would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. if he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? they have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. i am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so i have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that i can go over with her later, so i'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
my family is very quiet, i don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  i would if that is the only option, however.  i don't know if it's relevant that we are muslim, either, i assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  my father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  he doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  i would love some advice.  apologies for length.

"i think my dads company is responsible for his death california. my dad passed away last week while at work. he had a massive heart attack. he was in the bathroom while the attack happened and he tried calling 911 repeatedly. here's the thing though, 6 months ago, his company installed some kind of signal blocking device in the bathrooms because employees were going to the toilet and browsing the internet. 

the doctors say that if he'd received medical attention within 20 minutes he might've made it but they didn't find him until almost 2 hours after he'd passed. last month, there was a nasty car wreck just outside his office and apparently ambulances were on the scene within 10 minutes so i'm sure that if he'd been able to make the call, he might've lived. 

i spoke to the company and they've told me to get lost, saying it's private property and they're well within their rights to use jammers how they please. is that true? i'm struggling with the funeral costs as it is, i can't afford a lawyer, especially if it's going to go nowhere. ",2
"today i came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from. the mystery fence(https://imgur.com/gallery/5k6nqdq)

delaware, usa. no homeowners association.

we live in a row home and the house attached to ours is vacant. it's been on the market since before we moved in, and nobody's lived in it for at least 7 years. there was a small cast iron fence between the two yards (on my property line) that went from under the fire escape to the brick garage (which you can see in the image). i removed that fence as it was on my property about a month ago and installed brand new, beautiful sod.

well i come home today and this disgusting, mismatched random combination of fences has been erected between the yards. part of it goes over my property line, crushing the sod, at the bottom of the fire escape. the leprechauns or whoever installed it stepped all over my grass to do so, and to top it all off, they gave us the ugly side, which is totally against fence etiquette.

i don't know who owns it, so i called the real estate agent. he was just as shocked as i was when i told him there had been a fence built at a house he is selling. he had no idea. he'll be in contact with the owner of the property tomorrow, but she is a 70 year old woman who doesn't live here, and he said he can't imagine why she would have a fence built. i asked my neighbor on the other side if she saw anything. she didn't.

what do i do about this fence?",2
"neighbor tresspassed on my property and posted online my custom carved wood in my yard as free for taking. it was taken by someone mistakenly thinking it was hers to give away. how can i proceed legall?. long story short, i live in ny. my bfs hobby is to take re-claimed wood custom cut it and make table tops or shelves out of them, selling some tables for $400 or more. i had 3 of these 7ft long oak wood sitting on the side of my house for a month, out to dry in the sun, on planks. those pieces can be sold for $1,200 or more when finished. this lady that lives in the area assumed they were for the trash and publicized the wood online as ""next to a dumpster and going to a landfill"" (my recycling bin was next to this wood, on the back end of my house.) i came home to my wood missing and i found her post online, giving it away for free with my exact home address for all to see. someone unknowingly thinking it was hers to give away snagged them. i contacted the guy, and got it back. i then wrote her a message showing her a screenshot of the ny state government property lines website of my properties boarder which she clearly crossed over to take the photo of the wood on my property. i told her to never do that again and mind her own business. her response was ""i am quite too busy to read all this, either way it was a mistake. good luck out there in this shitty world, it sure is a bear."" after that passive aggressive bullshit i went to the police. i filed for tresspassing. the cop said i could get her for possible larceny. idk how that wouldnwork if she didnt take it herself. i'm just wondering... how far can i push this? i am now completely uncomfortable with doing future projects in my own yard and the entire town i live in now knows my exact address attached to my name because of this lady. the cops said they would go to her home and ask her side of the story... i have pictures of her post, pictures of my property line and screenshots of many people i didnt know very well, asking me if her post was in fact the wood on my property that i had posted on my own fb that i was in search for, linking my exact name to that exact address. i work as a bartender in town, where i have many strange men i dont want knowing where i live. she posted it to my towns facebook page. maybe if she was more kind i would have let bygons be bygons but now, i'm thinking ""the world sure can be a bear""",2
"(update) school kept giving our son peanuts even though hes allergic. lawyers are expensive.... original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9x6enr/son_has_a_peanut_allergy_school_continues_to_give/

the past 3 months have been long and expensive but it's finally resolved. now i can't go into a lot of the details after but i can go over some of the details that happened during.

we contacted a few attorneys and finally found one we were comfortable with and then the fun started. we first sat down with the principal and teacher with our attorney and he didn't say anything except he needs to talk to someone else and not us.

our attorney then began collecting documents and statements/affidavits from our pediatrician, another doctor and even got another opinion. then he began having us get documents from the school, some of which they said we couldn't have but our lawyer assured us we could have them. so he sent the school district some nice letters and a few phone calls later we had everything. talking to our insurance and the hospital was the easiest part of this entire thing which i thought would be more complicated and our insurance even offered their attorneys services to our attorney which turned out to be quite helpful with some of the other issues that came up along the way.

he spent about a month going over everything, talking to doctors, getting more statements and reaching out to other parents etc. during this time our child was moved from his normal classroom and placed in a special needs classroom. something we did not agree to or with, our child has no developmental problems and an allergy hardly is a special need. 

so our lawyer then starts having us request more documents, same act with the school and he had to send off letters and phone calls to get the new stuff related to him being put into a special needs classroom. the lawyer began sending letters about how the school district is punishing our child with the move to a more restrictive classroom and a different curriculum and magically the next day he's back in a normal classroom.

finally after 3 months of mostly playing the game with the school district getting them to give us the paperwork and requests they are legally required to did we all finally sit down with the school districts attorney and our attorney.

now i can't go into a lot of the details but i can tell you they settled without us moving onto the next step of having our meetings in a courtroom. lawyers are expensive, and so are hospital bills. i just hope all of this doesn't make our child a target for the rest of the year. we are going to be moving and changing jobs over the summer hopefully. 

thanks for all your help and advice guys and girls, the plans everyone brought up for us to look over was incredibly important because we already had them on file with the school.",2
"tenant is renting out my apartment on airbnb. tenant isn't responding, airbnb doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. i have no idea how to even handle this.. location: toronto, ontario

i own an apartment in downtown toronto, our building has had a bad history of problems with airbnb tenants so we voted to ban any sort of short term rental. currently i am on the other side of the continent for work, and won't be back until january.

i decided to list my place up for a rental in late august, for rental until janaury. since the rental time was almost half a year it doesn't count as a short term rental (several people do this in our building and it is fine). i immediately got a hit by a person named jane who was a student about to start grad school (i don't know if this is true or not), and we talked and decided to agree to the rental.she signed a document indicating she agreed to the buildings rules, including the notice about ""no short term rentals, through services such as airbnb"".

yesterday i got an email from our property manager:

* on monday they were testing each units smoke detectors, and he noticed there were 3 people in the unit. along with a strong smell of pot. they apparently identified themselves as airbnb renters. (apparently they tried to deny our property manager from entering, since they weren't sure of who he was since they were only renting this place for a week through airbnb).
* i am violating the rule about no short term rentals.
* i am apparently in violation of a bunch of rule violations such as the fact that more people are staying in my unit than permitted.
* apparently multiple guests have been parking overnight in the visitors spot (not allowed) who all recorded my unit number as the one they are visiting.

after getting that email i called him and confirmed, and i was able to find my place listed on airbnb, using very recent photos of my apartment. i tried to contact jane, through email (no response), phone calls go to voice mail, and facebook (she blocked me after i sent her a message).

i have tried numerous times to talk to airbnb, but all they have told me is they can't do anything about this, and basically refused to do anything about the listing.

aside from all the issues above, frankly i don't feel comfortable with a bunch of random strangers in my apartment at all. unfortunately i have no idea even what to do about this legally speaking. do i have any way to block these random people from entering my unit?

\*edit\* i forgot to add, that i have talked to a lawyer about evicting the tenant however he told me it could take upto 2+ months, which is why it won't really help. since by then in \~2 months her lease will be over. i want to stop randoms from airbnb from entering my apartment now. ",2
"update: i just recieved a demand letter from enterprise rent-a-car stating that if i do not return their rental car, i will be charged with embezzlement and grand theft auto. i never rented a car from them. (san jose, california). thank you to everyone for the advice. i'm also a she by the way (many of you thought i was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

after my initial post, i saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because enterprise is the one at fault and i shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. so i did exactly this, and she told me that id i want her to give me more info, i would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that i am not the person who rented the car.  if not, she would report me for embezzlement and grand theft to the sacramento police. upon hearing this, i decided to file a report immediately online with the san jose police department. i know many of you said i shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, i did not want to take any chances where i could end up with a warrant on my head.  i thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  after filing it, i emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  when i spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that i was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

on may 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. she showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had my information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with cash. (i thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) the manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the sacramento police later that afternoon. the following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as fraud, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  at this point, i was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. i then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to sacramento see who the hell this woman is. however, turns out i didn't have to because 2 hours later...  
  
  
  
the san jose police did show up knocking on my front door. ( 2 policemen and 2 chp officers) before opening it, the first thing i did was grab the copy of the police report i printed because i seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). when i open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if name of woman i do not know lives at my home? i tell them no, and that i have no idea who that is,  then they ask if i am alymg and i tell them that i am. they then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of fremont that morning. the accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. they then show the license to me and it's an exact replica of my drivers license, and i ask them how this is possible if i have my license in my wallet? they then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (the black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) i then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when i hand them my report. i explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from enterprise.  so basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. i told the officers that i have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. i then asked them who is the name of the woman i do not know and they told me that she is the who stole the car. however, i'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we do not look a-like at all. idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. but after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

i do have her name now though, and after doing a google search i found her facebook and other social media accounts. i'm very tempted to message her but i've decided to leave this to the police because i have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she does know where i live) however, i do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

"girlfriend was arrested w/ a dui but blew a .06!!! cop arrested her after making her remove her glasses for the sobriety test!. so..... my girlfriend went out for a couple drinks with her friend tonight. she didn't drink much and she waited until she knew she was sober to drive home. when the time came she drove herself and her roommate home in her roommates car (well... was headed home). on her way she noticed that the headlights were off, and flipped them on a couple blocks down the road. a minute or two later she was pulled over by a police officer. she admitted to having a couple of drinks and the officer asked her to get out of the vehicle. 

this is when it gets interesting. 

the officer made her take her glasses off, in the dark... during a snow storm... to perform the sobriety test. he then declared that she was drunk without having her blow to test her bac, and arrested her on the spot and took her to jail. 

then, at the jail, she blew a .06!!! that's below the legal limit (we are in wyoming). and the lady at the booking desk told her to get an attorney when she heard what her bac was. 

my question is, does she have a  decent chance to be ruled innocent in a court of law? we have no money and probably can't afford a good lawyer. i could barely afford her bail. she is on track to be a school teacher and blowing a .06 shouldn't deter her from pursuing her dream. 

any advice would be greatly appreciated right now. we have two weeks before she has to appear in municipal court 

edit: she also told me this morning that when he arrested her he didn't tell her the miranda rights (found out he doesn't need to)


edit: thank you all so much for the help

edit: i am against drunk and unsafe driving (and so is my gf). in this situation she believed that she was good to drive and would not harm anyone. it was a shitty situation all around and she wishes that she had just walked or taken an uber.

"my parents have refused for years to do anything about my sister and now she has broken my nose. i am sick of this shit (florida). for clarity we're both minors. i'm 16 and my demonic sister is 15. she has never been right since we were little kids. always violent. she bashed me in the head with a metal pipe when i was 5 because i wouldn't let her ride my bike. all of my life i've been putting up with this shit and i have had enough.

she hits me, breaks my things, literally stabbed me last year, stole the keys to my car and banged it up twice this year. my parents wont do anything about it. she's already in alternative school for stalking another girl in her class. i really don't know what is wrong with her. she's not slow or anything like that before she got kicked out of regular school she was in the gifted program. my parents think she's like this misunderstood genius or whatever. they refuse to involve cops because it's a ""family issue"". which brings us to today. my parents force me to let her tag along with me and my friends because honestly she doesn't have any except for this delinquent at the alternative school she is supposedly dating. whatever, not important.

anyway, i was hanging out with my friends today and of course the demon was with us. we decided to go to the dollar tree to get some snacks. demon didn't buy anything. as we left the store i could hear something in her bag like a rattling noise. i confronted her and this little beezy stole a bunch of cough pills! i don't know why. don't they make meth out of those or something? so i told her i was going to call mom. i pulled out my phone right there and she fucking punched me in the face! i was really angry she did that in front of my friends and no way was i going to let her embarrass me so we started fighting. i took her down and had her pinned on the ground. that's what you have to do pin her and let her tire herself because she will not stop otherwise. i had her arms pinned and she started flailing her legs and kicking me. she got me in the throat and i was letting her go! i was getting off of her when she kicked me right smack in my face full fucking force like she charged that fucking kick up and broke my nose. blood was gushing everywhere and she didn't even care she just left! 

it took forever to stop the bleeding and my face is swollen and ugly. it hurts like a bitch. my friend gave me a bunch of tylenol and it still hurts. i came home and told my parents immediately and they asked me what did *i* do to upset her?! i was so angry i told them i was calling the cops and my dad told me i couldn't go to the cops without parental consent! is that true??? 

something needs to be done about her because she's like getting a lot worse and my mom is 8 months pregnant now and i'm really scared for my little brother when he gets here.  please help me. 

update: well shit went down basically how i expected it would. my mom called me very upset that police had came. what happened is my dad answered the door and he was really mad and probably drunk honestly and they told him they were there to check up on my sister. i asked if my friend's mom would really play up the fact she's crazy af to get her baker acted because i was afraid they wouldn't arrest her and she'd come after me. well my dad didn't want to let the cops in and basically told them to fuck off and they threatened to arrest him if he didn't so he finally let them and i guess my sister must have heard all of this going down so she barricaded herself in her room and wouldn't answer so they broke down the door and they found a bunch of empty pill bottles in her room and she was really disoriented so they called an ambulance and she got taken to the hospital. my mom said she went in after they left and there was a bunch of empty bottles of cough medicine. she said my dad is super pissed but she told me she's honestly relieved.

"the daughter i gave up for adoption is threatening me with legal action tx. when i was 14, i was raped by a close family friend. i got pregnant but gave the baby up for adoption when i was 15. i knew the child was adopted by distant family members who lived a state away but i did not know their names or what they were like. we received a sum of 2500 dollars when they took her from the hospital. i do not remember signing anything.  i do not know what happened to the friend; i asked to be kept out of the process as much as possible. my mother said he was jailed but i don't know if he's still in jail, how long he was in jail, or if he even went to jail. i  have two other children, ages 10 and 7. and am now married. my husband knows about my daughter but has deferred to me on how we should handle the situation.

&#x200b;

a month ago, i received a facebook message from a woman who says she is my daughter. i believe she is because her appearance and that she has the same genetic condition as my rapist. she told me that she wanted to get to know me. i spent hours going through her facebook page, trying to decide what to do. i found myself disgusted by her. there are a lot of similarities between her and my rapist as she is rude, vulgar, whiny, and smokes illicit substances. she is married but has a publicly strained relationship with her husband and refers to him by cruel nicknames. i decided that i would not be comfortable meeting her. i blocked her without responding. after a week, i began to receive letters from her. four letters in total. i did not read those either but recently received a phone call three days ago. i finally answered. i told her that i was not interested in getting to know her and that she should leave me and my family alone or i would get the police involved.

&#x200b;

she  began to berate me. she told me  that my family was her family. she accused me of not going through proper adoption procedures and that i had maliciously sold her to an abusive couple as punishment for being born and that i had held back important information. without medical records, she lived life as a very sick child and was deeply in debt from the genetic testing necessary to diagnose her illness.  she told me that she would be making contact with my family whether i liked it or not. she also said she would subpoena me for her father's name if i did not comply and that i could possibly be jailed for selling a baby. when i began to cry, she offered me an alternative; her genetic condition makes getting pregnant more difficult. if i agreed to pay for a round of ivf, she would consider us ""even"" and would only try to make contact with her father. here are my questions:

&#x200b;

1. does she have a legal right to make contact with my family if i tell her to stay away?
2. could she force me to disclose information about her birth father?
3. my parents are dead and i do not know how to find out information about the adoption. i did not sign any papers and didn't really speak to lawyers outside the court case. i am worried it is possible my parents merely handed her over in exchange for the money. could i be arrested for selling her as a teenager?
4. i have money in my savings account and could afford the amount she is asking for. could i form a contract that would legally force her to leave my family alone if i agreed to pay?

edit: amount asked for was removed. also, because several people have asked: i do not want her to know her father's name because the family has previously harassed and threatened mine. it only stopped once i left the state. i am worried that if she finds them, she will give them my address and i will need to move again.

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7r12hs/pa_my_ex_has_nude_photos_of_me_and_threatens_to


my post was not hugely popular, but i have a small update. thank you to everyone who commented on my previous post, i read all of them, even the ones i didn't reply to immediately.

i called the police last night. an officer came out to my house, he read the messages, saw the photos, and said, ""yeah that's illegal and i don't think it gets much easier to prosecute than this."" he had my fiance send him screenshots of everything and then the photos separately. he took my ex's information, our information, and the surprisingly ample amount of information i have on his girlfriend. 

my ex is currently on both probation and parole, so the officer is reaching out to his po today for a current address since he refused to provide it to me. he'll be calling my ex today, and if he hangs up on him or gets smart, he'll be prepared with an address to just go talk to him. he also knows where he is working this evening while the officer is on duty, so that is a last resort.

he is also going to run the evidence and our statements by the da's office today and get the green light to proceed with charges, which apparently will include an actual arrest once everything that needs to happen happens. i'm not clear on the details exactly, i just know that they are almost certainly going to be charging him with a misdemeanor 2. 

additionally, i am almost positive that my ex's current girlfriend, who he has been with for roughly 9 months now, was involved in some manner. she is an rn, so if it comes to light that she was complicit, she could also be charged and lose her job. i don't know how it would impact her license as an rn, but i did work for the hospital she works for currently, and any charges, no matter how minor, result in termination. the officer confirmed this, as well. 

and i took everyone's advice - i contacted my attorney. he is drafting a cease and desist letter to send to both my ex and his current partner. he is also going to request a copy of the police report to add to the already massive stack of evidence of reasons why he should not get custody of either of his kids, he should remain strictly on visitation, if he's lucky enough to even get that.

thank you everyone, i have a small amount of hope that this will work out favorably. my current partner doesn't care what he has to say or what pictures he sends, he sees it every day. he also knows that my ex is vindictive and is grasping at straws in an adult temper tantrum. hopefully this will end the years of this crap from my ex, as this is not the first partner he has done this with. it's just finally a charge in pa!",2
"my brother stole almost all of my inheritance and spent it on food and games. what actions should i take against him?. hello. i'm a first-time poster, and i'm also on mobile. i am 19, and i currently live in new york city.

my parents died when my brothers and i were young (eldest was 11, second (the brother in question) was 7, and i was 5). they left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. i turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. it was in march 2019 that i finally got it. it turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. i decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. i wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. i called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after i deposited the money. my savings account has also been taken from. i'll admit, i really should have been paying more attention, but i was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and i got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. we tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. he had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

when i confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. he spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. i know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. it's just line after line of uber eats, postmates, and game purchases. my grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence. it would take years for him to make that money back on minimum wage. should i call the police and have him arrested? is there any way to get that money back?


edit: okay, i've decided to call the police and sue the bank. i know how to get my hands on bank statements, and i'll record him confessing to the theft. but i don't know how to hire a lawyer. where do i start?

edit #2: okay i just figured out how he got ahold of my account details. my grandma sends him to the store with her atm card sometimes to get money. he memorized her card and pin, found the account shared with me, and took from it.

edit #3: thank you so much everyone for all of your concern and advice. i got a ton of messages and i'm trying to answer them all, sorry if it takes long.

i've managed to convince my grandma (after a long arguement about this potentially ruining his life) to sue the bank for negligence and speak to a lawyer. we're going to see if the court would be willing to send him a mental institution instead of jail. haven't gotten him arrested yet, but i told her if need be, i would call them myself.

i like to clarify my grandmother's intentions on protecting him like this. my mother committed suicide right after my father died, and my grandma felt responsible for not helping her or seeing the depression that had taken hold of her. she explained to me that she knew something was mentally wrong with my brother, and was trying to ""make up"" for ignoring my mother's mental state by shielding him. she had no play in stealing my inheritance, other than giving him her card and pin under the assumption that he was just getting money for her since she can't easily walk to the store and use an atm.

edit #4: so i went to the bank. because he went through my grandmother's account, the bank says we have no claim. no case to sue the bank with. there's nothing i can do to get the money back. i'm ruined financially. all i can do is sue him and put him in jail, but i'm never gonna see that money again. i'd like to thank everyone once again for their help, and i'm sorry if i haven't responded to your messages yet. also, thank those two people who gave this post silver and gold. this will be the last edit i make, hopefully.",2

"update texas my mom has my cat and has repeatedly sent threats all weekend claiming that she beheaded him. however, the police is still alive, and when i showed up to collect him, she refused to give him up. how can i get my cat back?. link to original post,

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9u6h0i/texas_my_mom_has_my_cat_and_has_repeatedly_sent/

hello,

first off, thank you to those who commented with helpful advice. i didn't feel like advice to steal my cat back was 'legal' (thus, being in this subreddit), so i took one users advice to talk to the director of animal control in my mom's city.

she basically told me that the police have no idea what they're doing, especially when it comes to law regarding animals. she said that the only thing i can do to get them to understand is to report my cat as 'stolen property'. she said the police will understand what to do if a i reference my cat as 'property' and not an animal.

i went to the police station and the police threw me around again. despite i tried to report stolen property, they got upset at me and claimed that a cat isn't 'property'. after 5 minutes of arguing, they send a cop out to the lobby and he agreed to read my mom's texts. 

the cop read them and said that since she claimed that the cat is mine, and she told me to collect him, i can go to her house with a police officer and he will assist me in getting her to hand back over my 'stolen property'.

we get to my mom's house and she's not there. we look around the outside of her house and find no signs of kitty either. i call her and ask her where she is, and told her that i was at her house with the police. she said, in quote, ""i took the cat and ran off into oklahoma and i'm not ever coming back."" 

the police said they can't help me since they don't have jurisdiction in oklahoma. 

i went to the courthouse to file a small claims against my mom, but the filing fee is $171.00, so i left because i can't afford it. on my way home, i contacted adult protective services in one last ditch effort, but was on hold for over 3 hours. so i hung up and filed a complaint on their website.

i also called my grandparents and they were the ones who tipped my mom off, which is why she ran into oklahoma. my mom played the 'poor me' card, so my family bought into it. and somehow, i'm now the bad guy in the situation who is trying to murder the cat... when i got home, i cut everyone out. all of my family. i separated every single tie i had to them.

i've had that cat since he was 2 days old, and if i'm being open about the situation, i was a victim of childhood abuse. that cat was the only thing who showed me love for most of my childhood and teen years, and it kills me i won't be able to get him back. i ended up hurting myself and had a nervous breakdown, and now i'm getting help for my own mental health. this situation broke me, and right now, i'm trying to recover.

thank you everyone for listening. 

**tl;dr:** my cat is gone and i'll never get him back.",2
"update: my landlord has 'revoked' permission to hospice at home. wtf do i do.. because i know you lovable assholes are all about the updates...and seriously, thanks for all the kindness on my post.  you all helped break the cycle of panic.

original:  https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nxple/colorado_my_landlord_has_revoked_permission_for/

turns out it wasn't my landlord at all.  it was my roommate saying my landlord had said i couldn't hospice there.

yeah.  i know.

i specifically moved in with this person for this reason...with the understanding i would be dying in this house.  i'm not sure if it was malice or just idiocy but apparently she thought that 'terminally ill' was just a cutsie designation or something?  and i guess she thought it wouldn't actually happen.  so instead of telling me six months ago, or three months ago, or when the hospice nurse started coming to the house...she tells me three weeks into hospice care that, supposedly, the landlord says ""you can't do in-home hospice here"".  


obviously this is super illegal (thanks, la!), and i call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

i started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after i threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate gave landlord's info to me... and i call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what i was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

so yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because i subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  my attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  everybody wins?  

except i still gotta die, yo.  after i move lol.  at least i can afford it i guess.  :( 

thanks la.   ",2
"can my parents force a paternity test update. last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/92evgg/can\_my\_parents\_force\_a\_pregnancy\_test/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/92evgg/can_my_parents_force_a_pregnancy_test/)

&#x200b;

i'd like to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. your advice helped prepare me for what came next.

&#x200b;

pretty soon after i posted, i received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. i knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so i googled the law firm and lawyer's name. i couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so i reached out to them. the letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. they asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. i don't know exactly what's happening as i have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&#x200b;

in other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that i also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. we still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

"update coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex's dog euthanized. can i help prevent this?. link to first post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c34jp2/coworker_is_bragging_about_filing_a_false_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

glad to say i've got a happy update!

the coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). i wasn't working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

the ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. he's also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. the dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn't shown any human or dog aggression. 

police and animal control are very good around here. they assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they'd require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can't be ""bitten"" by the dog without violating it. and the department says they don't allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog's owner but not the police/animal control. 

so the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. i'd call it a win!

thank you all for your advice and support!",2
"my school is demanding for a copy of every students car key. (ga). i found this out about two hours ago. my  high school posted the rule book along with the normal info for the  school year.

in the rule book section about driving to school, it states in bold letter; all students who drive to school using a personal vehicle must give the school a copy of the key or key fob.

after i read this i thought it was a misprint or a mistake. so i called the principal and school board, they both said that it was real and if you park on school property you must follow that rule.

about 30 minutes later i checked the school website and others were complaining  on the forums about it. they went on to post their reason, they want to be able to do random searches or drug sweeps.

i personally find this to be a invasion of privacy. what can i do to stop this?

edit: campus is the only place around to park at without paying $100 for a parking pass.

"i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately.. i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

this is a throwaway account, due to certain circumstances i worry for my safety of myself, family, & friends so thus the throwaway. 

i am currently residing in wisconsin.

i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

**information:**
my very first inkling something was up, is the day i believe this happened he came running crying into my arms when i picked him up, previously he was excited to be dropped off and picked up because he loved being there. and they had both previously baby sat my child and other children for a year, and there were absolutely no issues at all.

after this had happened, my 2 year olds entire demeanor has changed negatively, he has become angry and aggressive toward everyone in the house, including the family animals.

that night i had picked him up, i changed his diaper before bed and his body had  become stiff as a board. this is extremely unusual as my 2 year old usually is a playful child and tries to squiggle away from me or ""washes his hands"" with the baby wipes. this time he was not himself. he was scared, eyes wide as a deer in the headlights. as i took off his diaper he covered his eyes and began weeping softly, then moving his hands to cover hisgenitals and shouts, ""no! no no friends boyfriends name!"" and began crying hysterically. 

my heart sank. as a mother, my gut feeling is screaming that something happened to my baby. i know something was done to my baby. 

i looked my friends boyfriend's criminal records online and he has many petty things starting from 1999 but most notably he was charged with 3rd degree rape of a minor under 12. this man is dangerous, and i didn't even know this.

**my concerns and what can i do?:**

notably in wisconsin, cases involving you children, how often does cps investigate the person reporting? both myself and the party involve?

will the investigators / cps take this matter seriously when regarding my child's age?

how do i go about reporting this and keep me and my family safe?

what kind of things will they (either cps or law enforcement etc) look into?

if reported, and nothing happens, what things can i do to protect my child(ren) and my family? 

for a two year old child who has been sexually molested, what are some other signs i can keep my eyes open for?

any advice, any help at all will greatly help. i'm absolutely devastated and need help as i'm at a loss.

**edit:** i need to mention that this man has gang ties that originate from a very large city near us, hence why i'm scared for myself and my family.

**edit 2**: i am currently on my way to my appointment with cps and law enforcement that specializes in sexual abuse cases i will update later, thank you all so much for your kind words of support and advice, i honestly appreciate it and will update on the outcome.",2
"my dog keeps getting attacked by an emotional support dog in our apartment.. \wisconsin\ there is an 8 month old male german shepherd that is not fixed living in our apartment building. i have a six month old australian shepherd. we live on the fifth floor and the gs lives about four doors down. we run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.

he has attacked my as in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. he attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the gs was hostile. the worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. when we walked inside the gs was off his lease and immediately started attacking my as. the owner did not immediately intervene. i got down to try to get between the gs and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. after about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the gs off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. i took pictures after the event. i had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my as's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about five minutes.

i first spoke with the apartment building and asked their advice. they said as long as the owners were taking preventative measures, such as a muzzle, they would not intervene. i spoke with the owner of the gs after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their gs just for on the grounds. the attacks have happened so often that i do not think they can easily control their dog. my as is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from gs's if he sees them in public.

after seeing the gs and the owner for about a week after these events, i kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. i spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. she said that the 8 month old gs is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. i suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. she said she is not comfortable with that.

i do not know the logistic of esd's but i do know they do not have the same rights as service dogs. what should i do in this situation? i feel that if i go to the apartment building at this point they will say there is nothing they can do as most people assume esd's have the same rights as service dogs (which is not true).

&#x200b;

**edit:** this post got a lot of responses and i'm so thankful for it. i read all your comments. unfortunately the post was locked before i even got off work so i didn't get to reply to all.

stemming from the advice i got i contacted the apartment again via email so that i'd have a paper trail, i explained that she said she would not muzzle him due to him ""being a esd"". i also provided links to local government sites stating that esd's are not the same as service dogs, and directly asked that they intervene at this point. i am awaiting their response.

i also called the local department of neighborhood services. i filed my case, she said they will assign someone to it who will contact me and begin the investigation into it.

in lieu of this, i then contacted the pet store where the worst attack occurred. the owner was very supportive on the idea of starting a case against them. she remembered the incident and said that i had made a purchase afterwards, so she looked up my name and found the exact time we were in the store. she said she will trim the cctv footage into a clip and email it to me.

so now i will have footage of the attack in the store, a picture of the resulting marks on my arm as well as my dogs bloody paw, and the email exchange with the apartment. i feel pretty ready to get this started now.

thank you to everyone who came here to help. i really had no idea where to go with this. i'd just like to say that my goal is not to have their dog euthanized. i blame the owners completely for this. i'm sure with the proper training he would not be so uncontrollable. my goal is for the gs to be muzzled while he is in public, and hopefully to be removed and given to responsible owners if possible. thanks for everyone's care and advice!

"neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the two spaces in front of our home. after asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving all their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home.. california here, getting that out of the way. and full disclosure, its not my home. the home belongs to my parents, but i house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus i love my parents and want what's best for them). i will just be saying my home or my driveway so i dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


these neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with all the memories. i thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

my parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. he has it parked in the middle so that it takes up all the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. it has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. why? i don't know. perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. all i know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

i want to also mention they have a full garage. they also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. and a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

i politely asked him to move his car when i saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. he followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. several days later i visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

i spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since i had asked him to move his car as payback. they said he's really mean and to just let it go. this did not sit right to me, so i later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. i explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

bad idea. i assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. i assumed mom would just tell 'billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. turns out he got it from mom and dad. i get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how i did not just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

i didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. my mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an fu to my mom and dad. that's also when their car got keyed

so since i made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. now the parents are retaliating too.they finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. the one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. the beater was moved so its parked on the other side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. sorry for the run-on sentence. did that all make sense? i hope so.

this has been going on for a few weeks now.

is there anything that can be done? my parent's just seem to want to let it go. not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. my parents travel a lot and my work makes it so i cant always be there to sit the house for them. they fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. i used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?


tldr - neighbors parked all their cars in front of my parents home and wont move them, only rearrange them. the neighbors go out of their way to be jerks to my parents. parents fear retaliation.",2
"(nyc) i am being harassed by the orthodox jewish ""police"" in my home. this has been going on for almost 2 years since i moved in. i am at my wits end, what can i do to stop it?. **edit2: putting this here since this is locked. thank everyone for all the advice/support. i will be following some of the advice recieved and update once i have one. if this works i'll be able to stay though an overwhelming amount of what i've been told leads to me accepting that there is a 60% chance i'll have no choice but to move. thanks expecially to all the  orthodox people who have reached out with practical advice and information about this group and how it works. that has been expecially helpful because it's put my situation into perspective. yeah it sucks but worst case i can move across down the block or something  and be rid of it which isn't the case for people within the community. and even though the nypd has been helpless from my perspective, they have always responded to my calls and made the group stop in that moment, which again, is not an option for people within the community. hearing from people on the other end has really helped accept the situation i've found myself in for what it is. will update when i can.**


*edit: since i am geting this a lot, to clarify: my building has cameras. the police have seen the footage. the police have responded to them harassing me and are fully aware of what is going on.  it hasn't helped. most of the time (today included) i have to call the nypd in order to get them to move and stop preventing my guests from coming in the building or to stop harassing me in that moment. they come, tell them to stop, then leave and they just do it again. today the nypd came to my home seven times. and this is common.*

i live in brooklyn ny. i purchased a condo about 2 years ago in a building where a good chunk of the apartments are rented out by orthodox families. i would say that 45% of the building is occupied by orthodox families renting and the rest are condos owned + occupied by non orthodox people. i honestly did not care and did not think this would be a problem.

since i moved in though, this has been a huge issue. i don't want to go into to much detail since it would just lead to a rant but the families in by building do not like/agree with my ""lifestyle"" and have been trying to make me uncomfortable enough to force me to move out. i honestly don't give two shits about their opinions and typically try my best to ignore them. the issue is that they have been using the jewish police to harass me. 
to give you an idea of the shit i am dealing with i'll tell you what prompted this post.  i chose to have a superbowl viewing party today. about 30 minutes into the start of the party (when there were five people here) i get a knock at my door and standing there are two fake police who try to tell me they got a 'noise complaint' and a complaint that we are using 'illicit substances' that i have to end my party. we were in my yard at this point literately just talking and smoking (cigs). my condo is on the ground floor and people who live above me can see directly into the yard so i am assuming they are who claimed the cigs were drugs.   since then, they have been standing outside of my building trying to prevent people i invited from entering and have been harassing my guess, treating to ticket them and demanding to search them. i don't want to make this post too long but this is the smallest of the shit that i have had to deal with from these fake police over the last two years. 

i am fucking done. i want this to stop. i have tried everything i can think of and dont know what else to do. i have tried calling the nypd every time they show up. this has not worked. i have complained to my condo association. no help. i have contacted my elected officials, filed complaints with the city and state, contacted the fair housing justice center to file a discrimination complaint, and nothing has worked. i keep being told that what they are doing is not illegal and that they have permission to impersonate (my word) the police and attempt to enforce (their version) of the law. 

at one point, i was gone for a week and my boyfriend was harassed for 'trespassing' for going into the home that i own with my permission. 

im sorry that this is such a long run on rant. i am just so fed up with this bullshit. i am being discriminated against and harrassed by fake police who are trying to bully me into moving out of a home i own on behalf of a bunch of people who dont even pay market rent to live in my building because they cant stand to live with a gay person and everyone is telling me this is legal.

am i crazy here? how is this allowed? what can i do to stop it? ",2
"i (27f) am being asked to use my personal computer and download a tracker for work. hello,

as the post says i am a 27 year old family nurse practitioner in **virginia**. i work in private practice, think family doctor, and my company from the beginning has required me to use my own personal computer. when i was hired i wasn't told about that, but instead on the first day, they told me to bring it and use it daily as it needs to go in with me to see the patients. i think this is crazy for a variety of reasons- lots of wear/ tear that i'm not compensated with, bring back/ forth- risk of losing it or it being stolen, patient's records on my personal computer, sick people getting germs on my computer and on and on. i have been at this position for 5 months and so far the mouse pad has stopped working because my hands are always wet with hand sanitizer. so then i had to buy a wireless mouse. i have a nice computer and i hate that it's being ""destroyed"" like this.

today i have strep. strep as an adult is terrible. i told my boss i could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. that night on the phone she said yes please work from home. first thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. it is a google chrome timer extension. i told them that i would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but i was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. she said ok, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since i wouldn't install the timer and that i was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

thanks for the help!

she ended up taking me to court. her lawyer focused a lot on my criminal record (which had happened before i even met her, and she married me knowing it). her lawyer claimed otherwise, that i had hidden my record from her and she only learned about it after our marriage. this was very easy for me and my lawyer to disprove as i had email communications with her acknowledging my record. she insisted the emails not being in her inbox is proof that the emails are made up. perhaps she seriously thought deleting the emails from her account would delete them from mine too. her own lawyer looked really upset after this. 

she dropped the case immediately after that hearing.

her own husband apologized to me, said he wouldn't have agreed come forward for adoption if he knew the truth. he was a decent guy. ex lied to him about me to get him to adopt my son. it's been a couple of months since then and according to my son they're now separated.

"two large pitbulls got loose from their owner's grip and attacked my dog unprovoked. this is the second time it has happened with those same dogs. she is refusing to pay vet bills this time because ""i shouldn't have been walking my dog around her apartment."" houston, tx. the first time i let it go because she paid the vet bills and my dog got the care she needed. she is a medium sized, 35lb dog.   
this time, i turned a corner with my dog and her dogs saw mine, overpowered her (walking both at once. about 60-80lb pitbulls) and even though i picked my dog up, they bit her leg and dragged her down before going for her neck. i screamed for help and eventually people came out to help.   

one bystander said i ""should avoid that area because i know her dogs live there."" and i guess they convinced that owner that it was my fault that her dogs attacked my dog.   

my dog has a reputation around the complex for barking and trying to intimidate people, but i keep her in check and hold a short leash because of that. my dog has never attacked anyone or anything and has never gotten out of my control because i know how to handle her. this lady said that ""my dog is known to provoke reactions"" and is using that to justify why her dogs attacked mine.

"my family is abusive and i want to emancipate myself. i'm a 16 year old girl. i live with my aunt and uncle and cousins. my maternal grandfather also stays with us. my parents passed away in a car accident two years ago - i was in the car but i survived - and i was taken in by my maternal aunt. my dad grew up an orphan so there is no family on his side.

the last two years have been hell for me. not only because i still can't get over losing my parents (i cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. my mom was actually estranged from her family. she was white, and my dad was black. her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. they have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and i guess i'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

they have told me just that on several occasions. that my existence is a mistake. i get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. and i'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. sometimes it gets physical. sometimes it feels like i'm trapped in a minefield. i have to be so careful about where i step cause the repercussions may be explosive. my ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. he has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

i can't live like this anymore. i'm an absolute emotional mess. i wanna emancipate myself but i don't know how to go about it. i know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 i'm close with a set of twins at school - i'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. their parents own a farm and i work regularly with the family. i'm also into photography and i've been doing real good with shooting weddings. they are very lucrative and i've saved up a substantial amount. with summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but i also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

the parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. i've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. i don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

i would really appreciate advice.

thank you

"neighbor threatening to sue over wheelchair ramp. my boyfriend has mobility issues and uses either a wheelchair or crutches depending on his pain levels. i've done a lot of home improvement projects to ensure he can get around my house easily, including a wheelchair ramp up to my front door. my front door is really recessed from the street due to my lawn and hidden by my porch, so the ramp isn't very visible from the street. i painted it to match the house as well.

few months ago, a new family moved across the street and the wife's never been very friendly with me like my other neighbors are, which i chalked up to her being shy or whatever. however, recently i got a note taped up to my door that said she's going to sue if i don't take the ramp down, as it's an eyesore and ""reduces curbside value."" i have no idea what she means since you can't see the thing unless you know what to look for and really get up in my property, as confirmed by neighbors and friends.

she refused to answer the door when i went over to talk to her about it. i'm trying not to lose my temper over this but it's hard. there's been many times my boyfriend has been screwed over by so-called ""handicap accessible"" places, i don't want my home to be one of them. does she have any sort of case? i'm in washington.",2
"bank gave away my entire banking account. so last week, a check i wrote bounced from an account i have that i rarely use. it's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. i called the bank where i was informed that i closed the account to pay for ""my wedding"". i told them i sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. after them jerking me around ""are you sure you're not getting married"" ""did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding""...etc. i finally got them to open a fraud case. 

here's the crazy part. i call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. i finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. this woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. she lives in florida and i live in colorado. we do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. so she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. i figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. open and shut case.

so now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. they asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but i have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. the icing on the cake was i got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

"my ex proposed. i said no. he is now talking about suing me. advice?. just want to say this is going to sound insane but i am not trolling/making it up.

me and this guy were together for 3 years. we're 19 now. we never talked about the future until a year in. before then i'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

in short, i wanted kids, he didn't. i wanted to stay in ireland, he didn't. i wanted to get married, he didn't. when i realised it was a bad match i broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. this happened a few times over the next 18 months in this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

we knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something i would want further down the line, i wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. if i were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then i might have an issue, but when i'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

when i went to see him this time i was again, considering breaking up with him. aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that i really don't like. so when i arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, i assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so i wouldn't cause a scene. i don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

in the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. first he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff i liked and what my taste was. i assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so i told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. i also said ""go cheap"".

the other thing he asked me was how i felt about public proposals. i told him immediately that i, personally, disliked them as i felt i wouldn't be able to say no, even if i wanted to. i feel like public proposals are ok when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not ok at all. i assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

i never thought in a million years that he would propose.

so you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

the ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. he got on one knee, and held it out to me. we were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

i said no.

well, i didn't so much say ""no"". i ran out of the restaurant.

he drove me there, so i got a cab back, and drove home that night.

i realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but i didn't know what else to do. i could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all i knew was that i didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. i felt like i couldn't even speak, i was so upset about the whole thing. so i just got up and ran.

i just want to take the opportunity to say here that i really really don't care about the rings. honestly, when i want to get married (which is absolutely not when i'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and i'd say yes. i wouldn't even need a ring. i know i'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what i'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

i didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. he said that he thought a proposal was something i'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. he said that he was out of pocket for the rings. he'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. he linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). when i asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped i would cover the cost of mine. he said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. he'd hoped that i would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but i said no. he also said i'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if i was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

we both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on sunday.

he has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that i have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which i had no part in spreading. he says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. so €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

i think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but i am not a law student or a lawyer. he is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

what do i do about all of this? do i need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

thanks in advance :)

edit:  he knew i wanted to get married but not to him. he not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. he openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and i told him that this was why i was breaking up with him the times before this that i have ended the relationship. during the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like i'm gonna propose"" (that one was last april)

"a good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. now his adult son is suing me (virginia).. so basically, i lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. he was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. we watched football together, drank together, and all that. i even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. the point, i guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. i think this point is important.




he recently passed, which sucks. then i learned he left me a little something. that little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since i had no idea he had that kind of money. that 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. so it's not like i'm getting the majority of his estate. but then his son, who i'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  i ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




i have three things going for me:




1. my friend was mentally acute. he had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. our town's not big, and i know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. hell, i even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. these people can be witnesses i think, though i don't know how civil suits work.


3. his adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. she came around from time to time, and knew her dad and i hung out and stuff. the first time i met her, her dad and i were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the south so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





basically, my point is he and i were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? also, what kind of lawyer should i hire? the lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but i don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.

i'm 18 and in college. like all 18 year olds, i mess up. i messed up big time and i ended up pregnant. i waited a week after my pregnancy test came up positive, i went to the doctor to 100% confirm the pregnancy, and my best friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, and i took a couples' trip to nyc so i could have the abortion in a safe environment and have everything taken care of in a timely manner. 

we got back to boston and life went on. i am in therapy to work through my problems regarding the suicide attempts of my older sister and dealing with the repercussions of her mental illness. i have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, i'm not considered depressed, i have no history of any kind of any mental illnesses, self harm, or anything of the sort. i receive my therapy in a non religious environment. this is just straight up confidential counseling because my sister attempted suicide right before i went to college, my parents are toxic, and i needed help with that burden. 

i told my therapist immediately that i'd had an abortion, told her my reasons (cost of a baby, not wanting children, i go to a university that i worked my ass off to get into and i'll be damned if i let an unwanted pregnancy ruin my life. i also could not raise a child that i disdained. selfish? yes. but i'm not sorry). i also informed her that my boyfriend and i are still together and that he and i plan on staying together, the sex was between two adults who 100% consented, it was just a mixup and confusion on both of our parts. he and i split the cost of the abortion with him paying 75% of the cost. 

i go home and do homework. at around 4 pm, i get a visit from the boston police who are investigating a rape. they think that i'm the victim and my boyfriend is the perpetrator and that i've been forced to have an abortion, i ask them where they got this false information and give them proof that both he and i agreed that abortion was the way to go. after a lot of talking to smooth things over and apologizing, they left. 

then i get a call from my parents. they're ranting on and on about how i've gotten an abortion and sinned in god's eyes, how i've been fornicating and screwed every man in nyc, and how my lack of contact (i'm nc with them because of abuse and they're narcissists) is killing my mother. they screamed down the phone for four hours before telling me that they've been given my address in boston by my therapist and are coming to get me no matter what. 

it becomes clear. my therapist called the police, reported a false rape and forced abortion, violated all sorts of confidentiality, and had to track my parents down (i never gave her their number, address, or personal information. she did not know their names, i only ever called them mom and dad) to call them to say that i'd been raped and gotten an abortion. 

i never gave her any sort of go ahead to do anything. i never used the word rape in our sessions, in fact, when i mentioned the sex, i called it ""consensual sex"". the police are still hounding me, i'm freaking out and constantly having panic attacks, my therapist is making things worse by continuing to knowingly provide false information to the police (although i gave them the information that should have ended this all), therapist is also saying that i have stockholm syndrome and that's why i won't report my boyfriend, and i'm at a loss for what to do. 

i also know why she's having some weird witch hunt. my boyfriend is in a fraternity and in her mind, i was brutally raped at a fraternity party (this is what she told the police). i was not and in the session i said specifically told her that i never had sex with him at his fraternity house several times when she tried to convince me that i was raped at his fraternity house. 

i've also started to get calls from the nypd investigating the ""forced abortion"" and i'm freaking out and don't know what to do. this is serious. 

at this point in time i know that i need to get the police off my butt. is there a way that would help me? is a lawyer the best way to go? also, is there a way for me to report my therapist and make sure that she is punished? is there a way to make sure she doesn't do this again? 


edit: when the cops came the first time, i told them that she was completely falsifying everything and i gave them evidence. she is continuing to call and labeling me with various mental illnesses so she gets her point across and so i'm not taken seriously. the last time the cops called was last night.

"one of my relatives is ""homeschooling"" her kids, but isn't actually teaching them anything. her oldest is 2 years behind now. nearly 8 years old. is there anything i can do in texas to report her? i heard texas has pretty lax homeschooling rules.. by 2 years behind, i mean that she has admitted to not teaching the kid. she has stated herself that if she were to put the kid in school they'd have to start 2 grades behind. there are other things in their life that support this. but i don't exactly want to give out too many details. my question is simply that if i suspect she is neglecting her child's education what steps could i take? i don't care about your opinions on right and wrong. if i have legal steps to take then i will. if not, then i won't. that simple. having interacted with the kid and other kids that age, the kid is behind in so many ways. and no, their mom isn't teaching some odd curriculum. she just straight up isn't teaching her kids. she is like a very hands off day care for her own kids.

no she isn't doing what ever that unschooling stuff is. she just isn't teaching. she says she doesn't have the time. she is a stay home mom.",2

"il neighbor is using my paid parking spot (& has even gotten me towed). landlord hasn't done anything. i rent an apartment, and an assigned exterior parking space within my complex's parking lot is included in my rent. i have a parking pass that i display in my car, and documentation from my landlord stating that this specific spot belongs to me.

i have a neighbor that always parks in my spot. i have contacted my landlord every time this happens asking him to handle it, but nothing ever happens. i have also kept a log of every time i notice this neighbor in my spot & when i've contacted my landlord. (for what it's worth, neighbor does not have a visible parking pass on his car, and also puts a cone in my spot when he's gone to reserve it, so i don't think this is just confusion - i don't think he owns a spot at all).

this past weekend, said neighbor had my car towed from my spot. i confronted him in person, but all he did was claim that the spot was his. i once again contacted my landlord, who stated that this spot was indeed mine, i shouldn't have been towed, and he would speak with my neighbor to reiterate that it is my spot.

well, apparently neighbor didn't listen, because last night he was in my spot again. i called a towing company (same one that towed me) to have him towed last night, but they either didn't come or were talked out of it by him, because when i woke up this morning, his car was still there.

additional info that might be relevant: my complex is managed by an hoa, & my landlord always claims he'll ""notify them"" when i make a complaint about my neighbor. 

i'm growing incredibly frustrated with this situation, as i pay for this spot. with that being said, i'd appreciate advice on the following questions:

1. what can i do to stop my neighbor from using my spot?
2. what actions can i take to ensure my neighbor doesn't get me towed from a spot that i am authorized to use?

update edit: i just spoke with the hoa. they confirmed that the spot is mine & that this neighbor doesn't even have a parking spot at all. hoa also said he should've never been authorized to have my car towed, and are speaking with the towing company to ensure it won't happen again. finally, they provided me with a 24/7 emergency number that i can call to have my neighbor towed every time he is in my spot.

"i'm going to sound like a busybody but am concerned with my coworker and her boyfriend sleeping naked with her breast-fed seven-year-old; now she's getting ready to pull her out of public school because her teacher is questioning why the girl is smart but acts like a much younger child.. this coworker of mine is beautiful and very popular, but in my opinion is taking this hippie thing entirely too far. her daughter is smart enough but constantly reverting to acting like a toddler; she's doing it more than she acts her age. i support extended breast feeding but this is getting weird. we work at a health food store; we are talking major crunchy granola.  so, once she let it slip that they all sleep naked in bed together. i honestly do not think they are pedophiles at all, but as liberal as i am, that's still getting weird at her age.  i've always minded my own business, but now she's saying she's going to pull the girl out of the public school because the classroom teacher is starting to question the emotional development of the child. do i mind my own business or make a discreet phone call to cps?  no way in hell would i discuss the matter with her; she's on one hell of an ego trip.  could i do this anonymously? i can't risk cps telling her it was me. one last detail: another coworker's daughter spent the night at their house and they had both girls running around naked, which would not have been cool with the girl's conservative mom, but the adults were not naked in front of the girls. # free spirit!",2
"grandmother with dementia charged $13,000 usd for clothes at strip mall in florida. my grandmother who is 91 with severe dementia was charged $13,000 for five pieces of clothes at a strip mall in west palm beach, florida. we have limited the amount of money she can spend (she wrote checks for the clothes) and so the checks bounced. i have contacted the store owners who sent a 'receipt' for her purchases which is hand written on a piece of paper (no store business information) and just says 'dress $4000' and 'skirt $3000', etc.

i strongly suspect that the owner just made up these prices (that normally they would be sold for much less) and my grandmother was incapably of discerning any of this. my grandmother can't drive and has a full-time caregiver who was with her (and did nothing to stop this).  the owner is now asking me to pay what is 'owed' on the clothes.

"my sister is in some weird cult - mi. no, that is not clickbait and i am seriously very worried about her and all of the other people involved.

okay. so my sister graduated from high school last year and decided to take a gap year. she came across a craigslist posting by a woman i'll refer to as aileen about how she has a farm and she's looking for kids who want life experience, that she'll provide them room and board to work on her farm and how she can teach them all of these great skills. i never saw the ad, but i remember my sister telling me about it at the time. she was very excited, this opportunity was everything she had been looking for she had told me. so she began a correspondence with ""aileen"". i did not live with my sister, i'm older by 5 years so i was not on the scene when all of this was going down. 

so she ends up going to this place last august, i think, maybe early september. i have only spoken with her through emails since and at first she was happy, everything was good, she was making friends and all of that. i was wondering why she only emailed and she told me there's no phone service on the ranch, ""aileen"" doesn't believe in phones and she takes them to the library for internet access. that right there was the first time i thought something was a bit off, but my sister was happy so i didn't push it.

over time, the tone of her emails changed. she would talk about her friends there, the animals, all these activities she was doing, not about ""aileen"" much. then it gradually became that ""aileen"" is all she would talk about. ""aileen"" was telling her some seriously messed up stuff and if she didn't agree with it, everyone else would ignore her existence until she broke down crying and apologized. ""aileen"" made her slaughter her favorite chicken, ""aileen"" said she needed to cleanse herself and wouldn't let her eat solid food for a week. ""aileen"" made her take drugs. seriously disturbing stuff. i told her she needed to get out of there, that i'd come pick her up, but she would downplay everything, make excuses for ""aileen"", say she was over reacting, that it wasn't as bad as she made it seem et cetera. 

i didn't know what to do at that point. i thought something hinky was going on, but at the same time my sister was an adult and i trusted her judgment at the time. it's not like i had anything to go off of, a location, or anything and while disturbing, i didn't think anything super egregious was happening. ""aileen"" seemed like an eccentric survivalist type, but ultimately harmless. yes, i was tentatively concerned, is what i'm trying to say, but i felt like my sister was mature and intelligent enough to know when she was in over her head.

my sister emailed me yesterday and i don't feel like that is the case anymore. something had happened and from what i was able to ascertain, one of the other girls at this place committed some kind of cardinal sin and ""aileen"" instructed the other kids to beat viciously beat this girl. my sister was forced to participate in this. she seemed distraught about it, but ultimately blamed the girl because she should have known better than to have done what she did. i don't know what she did, my sister wouldn't elaborate on it. 

i stayed up all night pouring over all of her emails, lookings for some clue but i couldn't figure anything out. i know my sister took a greyhound to lansing and aileen picked her up from the bus station, so i think this freak show is probably in either eaton, or ingham but as to more specifics, i have no idea. i don't think my sister even knows. i have a hunch they're in, or around mason because aileen made the kids spend the night at seven gables, but other than that i'm coming up empty.

i know this is a jumbled fucking mess, but i really need to know what to do. how do i handle this situation?  

good update: i did what a lot of people suggested with the ip address. i would have never thought of it, i'm not very tech savvy. she is in mason or at least uses that library. i'm going to contact the police there. you guys are rockstars.",2
"nc my dog went missing a month ago and i found her on facebook. the family that has her refuses to return her to me. what can i do?. so a little over a month ago my purebred yellow lab went missing from my backyard. at first i thought she might have escaped but after looking around it turned out someone broke into my backyard and took her. i made a police report but nothing ever came of it and she didn't turn up anywhere.

last week though a friend who lives over four hours away from me sent me fliers that were put up for a found dog. it was my dog. i should mention here that my lab stands out due to the fact that she got into an accident as a pup that she lost her left eye in and tore here left ear up pretty bad.

i called the number on the flier yesterday and got into contact with a woman well call stacy. i told stacy that she had my dog and after a 20 minute conversation i all but confirmed it. here's the problem, when i asked what a good time to come and get my dog back she refused. stacy claims that they have had the dog for almost 3 weeks now and that because i took so long to get into contact with her she decided she's going to keep my dog because her kids have ""fallen in love with her"". i told her that was complete bullshit and that she was needed to give my dog back but she hung up on me and i assume she blocked my number.

i found stacy on facebook and she wasn't lying. i found a status from around three weeks ago talking about how she found my dog abandoned on the side of the street and took her in. she is now also posting pictures of her kids and my dog claiming they ""adopted"" her and renamed her.

i'm pissed right now and don't know what to do. that dog lived with me for over 5 years since she was a puppy and now because they've had her for three weeks they think they get to keep her. what can i do? i have all of the papers that prove i own her (dog licence, proof of ownership, medical records, etc) and she is chipped. i also have that police report. what do i need to do to get my dog back?",2

"update i have been paying for my entire apartment buildings water heating! and my landlord's response was: ""if you don't like it- just move out!"". here is the original post in case you are not up to date on the situation(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a05jq6/i_am_left_freezing_cold_in_my_apartment_as_i_pay/).

i have managed to uncover (for the most part) the cause of my exceptionally high hydro bills (averaging $400cad a month) in my apartment in ontario, canada.

&#x200b;

based on all of the advice i received from the original post – here's what went down after the comments got locked:

&#x200b;

**i managed to get onto my online hydro account – and discovered some very suspicious activity:**

* i noticed that each month was consistently high usage (every month i was consistently consuming around 2600 kwh. no matter the month – no matter if i was or was not using air-conditioning or heating during the month.
* i also checked the specific weeks where i was on vacation. i was not home at all and everything in the apartment was turned off- i paid around $70 for each week i was away. a total of $140 i paid when i wasn't even home for two weeks!
* furiously, i called the hydro company and asked them to look further – she told me the usage she is seeing is very unusual – it appeared as if the unit is vacant (consistently high consumption without much deviation).
* she also informed me that an inspector would be coming any day now...

**the inspector came to the apartment a few days ago, and accessed the meter (which was in the basement beneath the restaurant):**

* i was in school at this time so my boyfriend was there when the inspector came.
* the inspector noticed that the plumbing in the apartment for the hot water supply feeding each unit (possibly also the restaurant) were combined.
* the closest tank in circuit (mine) was doing all or most of the work for the entire building! feeding hot water to all the units.
* to prove this further, the hydro company closed the cold water intake to our apartment – and we were still receiving hot water! meaning the next closest tank in the circuit (our neighbor) was feeding our hot water.
* also, our hot water tank was feeding the cold water intake of the nearest hydro tank (the apartment next to us).

after emailing the landlord multiple times and waiting days for a response from him – he finally only came because now one of our neighbors was not receiving hot water. we noticed that he was in the basement doing something (probably fiddling around with the plumbing). after he left- we stopped receiving hot water ourselves. i had to shower at the neighbor's house yesterday because of this mess.

&#x200b;

**yesterday my boyfriend confronted the landlord when he came to ""see what's going on.""** *my boyfriend recorded the entire conversation in case we will eventually need it to support our case.*

* instead of getting a professional plumber to come and actually fix his mistakes. he is just poking and prodding at the hot water pipes (literally) and pretends as if he has any idea what he is doing.
* my boyfriend insisted that he get a certified plumber come and fix this massive disaster - and the landlord just complained about money and says that *we* should do it. (as if we haven't already done enough).
* the landlord was just complaining the entire time and even said ""**if you don't like it- just move out!""**

**i am almost certain that the landlord was aware of what was going on with the pluming in the building before we moved in**

* due to the fact that all the tenants before me have dealt with the same high hydro bills and have made complaints before (but they were all old and probably did not know that it was wrong, or what to do – likely my landlords favorite kind of person).
* since my boyfriend and i are having a hard time showering and washing the dishes with no hot water – we turned the hot water back on… meaning at this point we are carrying the entire load for the building again.

**my question to all of you:**

1. what do i do now?... can i trust my landlord to 'solve' this issue on his own – even though his ""plumbers"" will likely be rehired to do the work if we do?
2. what happens to all the money that quite literally went down the drain for this - and is still currently going down the drain?
3. do i need a lawyer?

thanks to all of you again – you have helped tremendously!

&#x200b;

***edit!***

* thank's to all of you who commented last night! - unfortunately the comments got locked before i could even reply to any of you! 
* i am working on contacting some lawyers now  and calling the tenant board on monday!

"(update) bought a ps4 from walmart for christmas and it had books in it. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a98686/bought_a_ps4_from_walmart_box_had_books_in_it_and/

ever since discovering right before christmas that the ps4 spiderman combo my wife purchased for our son had books in it and took it in to get a new one it's been an extremely annoying and stressful time.

i took the advice of everyone and called corporate, talked to corporate in their online chat, everyway possible and it's always the same a answer ""we stand behind the decisions of our salaried managers"".

corporate literally does not care and shifts it to the ""salaried managers"" decision. so i've been back to the same walmart 4 times to talk to them and the last time about 2 weeks ago they said they would call the cops. i wasn't yelling, or causing issues i just want the ps4 my wife purchased for our son for christmas. 

so the last time they called the cops, they came and the manager says right in front of me ""i believe this man has been trying to scam us since christmas eve claiming his ps4 had books in the box"". cop gets my story and says well there isn't enough to do anything against me, manager dislikes this that i've been constantly dealing with and i get permanently banned from the store (just that particular one, he can't ban me from all properties but said he will be calling corporate).

i again try to call corporate and nope, same exact replies that they stand behind their salaried managers decisions.

so the outcome? no ps4, no refund because it was purchased in cash and i cannot do a chargeback. if you are ever purchasing anything expensive from walmart, open the box immediately after purchase and in front of an employee. merry christmas walmart.

"wa my father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). my step sisters father, who has previously never cared about her, is getting full custody and has told me he won't allow me to visit. is there anything i can do?. hi, so my life is falling apart.

as the title says, a few weeks ago my father and my step mother were killed in a car accident. they have been married for 7 years, and my step mother had a daughter from a previous marriage who is 8 years old. i love her unconditionally as if she were my own sister and i would fight tooth and nail to keep her safe.

she has no immediate family other than her father in the area, so he is going to receive full custody of her. i don't know if subjective opinions are allowed in posts like this, but this guy is a fucking asshole. the reason my step mother left him is because he was abusive (which was never reported to the police, but i know several people who have witnessed it first hand, so it absolutely 100% happened), and the reason he was abusive was because my step sister was born and he didn't want a child. as a result, he has never given a shit about her, never asked to see her, and has never wanted anything to do with her until now.

i was at home with my step sister a few days ago and he knocked on the door. i opened it and we had a really ugly conversation about what was going to happen to my step sister now that her mother and my father were dead. i told him that if he did end up having custody i would want to be seeing her as often as possible as i consider her my family. he told me, verbatim ""that's not gonna happen, son. i don't want my daughter spending time with half caste blood."" (he's referring to the fact that my father is mixed race, and that i am too as a result. i slammed the door. i was absolutely livid, which brings me to this post.

so basically, i have a few questions:first, can anything be done to stop him having custody? there are no police reports about his abuse, and his criminal record is clean by all the research i have completed.

third, at the very least, could i contend in a court that i have visiting rights to her? i'm not actually related to her, so i'm not sure what the standing is there.

third, if it's not possible to force allowed visits, is there anyway i can straight up adopt my step sister? i have an office job that pays well, so financial security wouldn't be a problem, i have an apartment of my own, and i would be 100% willing to be her full time guardian.

**edit: i want to make it absolutely clear that my sister does not want to live with her dad, and she says she wants to live with me.**

thank you so so so much to anyone who responds to this. i'm at my wits end and i will do literally anything to keep my step sister close to me, and i don't care about the cost.",2
"update: my ex husband and his new wife made my daughter a back brace out of wood and steel and forced her to wear it (florida). **edit:** forgot to add this...my first post was here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4a97dq/my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my_daughter_a/

firstly i would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive pm's i received. it was really overwhelming (in a good way). a few people asked for an update so here it is.

so a lot has happened since i first posted. i called in to work while i was trying to get all this sorted. one of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. my husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. my daughter went to physiotherapy. eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. i was against it but the court ruled against me.

i gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. on her second visit it happened again. this time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. the next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. the neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. they had to cut the brace off my daughter. my husband and his wife were arrested. they got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with cps. my ex lost visitation and custody and i'm working on making it permanent. unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. it set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. she needed surgery and is still recovering. she always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. i hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. right now i'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. that's my update.",2

i got the timeline of my shares wrong, but it comes out the same. what my brother and i inherited from my grandmother was originally part of my grandfather's portfolio, he was the money savvy one. my grandmother looked after those after he died and she personally set up my brother's accounts and gave him control of his part. she didn't do the same with mine before she died (i thought she had already set the accounts up for me and given control to dad before passing) instead the shares were in her will, and she left everything she owned to my dad with instruction that what was $15000 worth when my brother got his equivalent part would go to me when i was old enough to know how to take care of them. there was no trust, she just trusted my dad. my dad did the right thing and set up accounts for me and gave me control six years ago. my dad put some of his own shares in too as an extra leg up.

dad admitted to me he'd chewed out my brother last year when he came to him asking for money, and dad had supported him several times over the years and got to the point he'd had enough. my brother found out i still had my investments because dad had used me as an example of how brother should have been using money. that's how my brother found out i still had shares and they'd grown.

according to all that info my lawyer tells me i'm in the clear, but it's not going to get to the point of finding that out in court as my brother's gf was only a legal secretary. i say was because the firm she worked for apologised and informed my lawyer she was terminated immediately. the letter i received from them had been edited to put her name in a position higher up than it should have been, and some of the contact information had been changed.

a week after she was fired my brother visited me begging for money. his girlfriend is in serious debt and she took a chance on scamming cash from me and lost. i felt awful rejecting my own brother over and over, and if he hadn't involved his girlfriend needing an amount well into five figures i might have given him some. the next morning i found all my tires had been slashed. screw him, i don't feel bad any more.

the rest of the comments in the previous thread made me realise i don't know nearly enough about what i'm doing with the shares and dividends and money in general. a lot of the decisions i've made have been with dad's help and his advice has paid off well so far but not because i knew it would but because i had no idea what i was doing and left it up to him. i've booked in to work with a financial advisor to make the most of what i have. thanks for all your comments.",2
"i found my 30 year old fiance talking to 13 and 14 year old children. what is my next step?. i apologize if this belongs in relationship advice but i am pursuing the legal route instead

i found messages on my fiance's snapchat account of him talking to two different people sexually and romantically. i took it upon myself to message each girl myself to get more information before i left him. upon talking to them i discovered that one girl is 14 and one is 13. the 14 year old claims that my fiance was willing to drive to her to have sex and that he also sent her explicit photos. i have no proof of these claims and neither does she due to him deleting his account and the profile is no longer able to be searched and messages cannot he retrieved. she also had one of my fiance's best friends added to her snapchat profile and was able to prove that his friend did send her sexually explicit photos of himself as well. 

we also have a one year old daughter who i am going to protect from him at any cost. what can i do to ensure this?

i have not contacted the police yet. i am not sure if a crime has been actually committed as i'm unfamiliar with the law. i just need help knowing how to get my ducks in a row and what my next step should be.",2
"banned from the local bus for not giving up my seat.. in a bit of a rush today so im just going to copy the story from my r/amitheasshole post: here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/9zfdq3/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

i used to take the bus daily to get to work. not a big deal, i'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.

but every thursday was awful. every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. still, generally not an issue because i'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.

but this bus company was not reliable. we have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. one day, a little school bus came instead. it had 9 seats. since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. so you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.

i have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, i needed that time to sit down. so, that's what i was doing, as always.

the group gets on the bus, i've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. i look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. i take out my earbuds and she says to me that i need to give up my seat. the other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when i tell her i need it she says that i need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. i try my best to explain that medically i can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says i'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). so after a couple minutes of this i snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as i'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. she gives me a look like i just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.

two days later when i tried to get on the bus i was told i was banned from the service.

when i called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the ""fully abled"" must give up their seats to those that aren't. i explained the medical reasons i needed it and was simply told i have a lower priority because i'm ""fully functional"" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as i ever knew. he ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as i know, but i feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.

on my original post it was suggested a lot that i make a post here. i live in ontario, canada. i don't have a lawyer but my mom has one she said would help me out, though he is currently out of town. i know almost nothing about the legality of what happened.

anyway that's why i'm here for help. am i in the right to sue? for how much? i don't know much about the legality of the situation and in general don't study law.

edit: there's a lot of responses on here so i'm sorry if i don't get to everyone, but for now i will pursue u/andthatswhathappened's advice and call the ontario human rights legal support center on monday. thanks everyone. i'll still be accepting further advice if there is more i should do though obviously i can't chase after compensation through more than one place.

edit: i gave them a call. it went well, should be covered from here. thanks all.",2
"when i was hired i was given a key and told if i lose it i owe $15,000. i lost it. do i have to pay up?. i am located in michigan.  

okay so when i was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) i was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  i was told that if i ever lost said key i would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

i have lost this key.  (it was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. i was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

so now my boss and my boss' boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the ""money i owe.""   i have received letters from their official letterhead and i am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. and they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

i have no intention of paying the fine.

the catch is that i was told this was the consequence verbally when i was handed the key.  my supervisor told me ""you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we'll worry about that later.""   i replied with ""to be clear, i will not be paying that if i haven't signed yet.  do you want to keep possession of the key until then?""  my supervisor laughed as though i was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn't forget to have me sign, he promised.

well he never brought it up again and i of course did not either.  

my question is.  can i be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of ""verbal contract?"" at this point i have not reminded them that i never signed.  i have simply ignored them.  but i worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and i'm not sure how to proceed.  i will be visiting my lawyer monday.  so hopefully more answers then. 

$15,000 is about 1/3 of my yearly salary. i can not afford this ""charge.""

"cousin confessed to falsely accusing my brother of rape. he was arrested, convicted and later committed suicide. i have her recorded confession. what should i do with it? (arizona). she accused him of rape years ago. she was 18 and he was 22. it was false and never happened. he was arrested and eventually convicted. when he served his stance and got out he was broken. from what he told me, he was heavily abused during his prison time by other prisoners. he tried to get back to his life and he couldn't. his record, his name on the registry and lack of options. he went from being a student in a top college in the country to having almost no prospects. within a year of being out, he committed suicide.

yesterday was 3 years since his death. this cousin sent word through a friend that she wanted to speak with me and seek my blessing on visiting my brother's grave. i said yes, but figured something doesn't seem right. i went and had a recorder with me and recorded the conversation. also had my boyfriend record a video of our meeting from a distance (it was in public). she told me she's sorry and my brother didn't deserve what happened to him. i asked why and pressed her for an answer, she broke down and said she didn't know who did it and she accused him because he had refused to lend her money she desperately needed and she was angry at him.

the voice recorder got everything, and the video also has audio in parts that match the voice recorder perfectly.

are these evidence useful in overturning that decision? i want to make my brother's slate clean. not only for his memory but also because he has a son he never saw (his girlfriend was pregnant when this happened, he lost his parental rights as a result of this conviction). his son should know this is not the kind of man his father was. if so, how do we begin the process? do we need a lawyer here, or do we need to go to the police?

what consequences (criminal) will she face? will she go to jail?

and, does my brother's estate have a claim against her for damages? of course this belongs to his son now although i don't know how that would work with respect to his parental rights being terminated (doesn't matter, as we'd want his son to be supported more than anything else). and can his son have a separate claim for damages against her? this conviction deprived him of a chance to know his father, because parental rights were terminated.

i know this won't bring my brother back but it can at least provide some comfort to us and to his son, and maybe making things more fair. so please help put me in the right direction.",2
"az discovered a video of my father raping me as a child. throwaway account for obvious reasons. i am a 19 year old male and i was recently looking through an old digital camcorder. most of it was really nostalgic, old videos of myself and my siblings as kids, stuff like that. i then came across a video of my father raping me. i don't want to go into detail as i am still in shock and typing this out is still extremely hard, but i have no idea what to do. i live a relatively normal middle class life and i am just at a loss of words. i have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as i don't want to face my family. the worst thing about this is my mother was present in the video as well, she seemed to allow it.

i am typing this through tears. i have absolutely no idea what to do legally about this. i cannot afford a lawyer.

"ma man that sold me a car called my insurance company and listed himself as a driver. now they won't take it off until he verifies that we don't live together. he's blocked my number.. i bought a car last year from a mutual friend that i didn't know well at all. everything was fine until this past june, when he fell into some heavy debt. he gave me a call sometime around june, asking me to take out a loan for him, to which i refused. red flag number one right there. after this, he began to harass and pester me for money (was already paying way more than i should've been monthly for this car). i eventually just gave the car back and that was that. i gave the car back mid july and purchased a new one (nissan altima) from a legitimate dealer. this morning i received a call from my insurance company (progressive), saying that this man has listed himself as a driver, costing me another $500. i calmly explained the situation, but they told me that unless he can provide proof that we don't live together, (we absolutely do not) i still have to pay it. this is absurd, how is this allowed? the guy in question is obviously desperate and trying to get back at me for giving the car back, but how can i provide proof for someone else? this is in massachusetts and i have progressive insurance.


update #1: okay so a lot has happened since i first posted. for starters, i should clarify some things. we signed an agreement that i would pay monthly increments for the title. until the car (30k) was paid in full, he held onto the title. initially he said i would be under his insurance, but only a few days after i saw this guy was kind of shady and switched to my own. i did not have the car in my name, which is why i was able to give it back so easily. i just thought ""screw this drama, i'll just get a new car."" today my adjuster happens to be ""out sick"" but i reported this man to both the state and federal insurance fraud agencies. a representative of progressive informed me that the man in question blatantly lied to my adjuster and told him we live together, and that he drives my vehicles occasionally. i have only spoken to him a number of times, so this is certainly not true. i've been in contact with a representative of both progressive and the insurance fraud agencies all morning and am finishing sending in documentation as we speak. i'm expecting a phone call and will update soon.

update #2: not much has changed since the last update, except everything has been officially reported with all required documentation. luckily i kept all of the text messages between us, which i attached to the reports i filed. with my adjuster out today (of all days, just my luck) it's a bit difficult to get this taken care of. after i settle this, because i am not paying an extra $500, i will most definitely be switching providers.",2

"(update) surprise divorce, husband cleared bank accounts. update from: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9xicm3/husband_surprised_me_with_a_divorce_cleaned_out/?utm_source=reddit-android

i wasn't able to get much done over the weekend except sell the wedding ring for some food/diaper money. today however was really busy, i spoke to a few people i was able to get in contact with through legal aid! 

i'm told by the end of the week i should be with an attorney who can begin helping me file everything i need to begin doing and hopefully begin tracking down where he's put all the money and get some back so i can continue to survive until i can be approved for childcare through state benefits and begin working again. 

i'm really surprised about how often this happens, there are entire places dedicated to helping men and women who have their wives/husband's do this to them. 

i am filing for divorce, before he can hopefully and for the return of the money into our account and an order to continue assisting with bills, child support and other necessities such as diapers, mortgage etc.

i probably will not have another update to this for a good long time but so many people wanted to make sure i was going to be ok and with everyone's advice to contact legal aid etc it looks like it hopefully might get better soon! i also contacted the bank and other bills that are coming up that i won't make and explained the situation. they are somewhat understanding and hopefully i'll be back at work soon to keep current.

"i called 911 for a medical emergency and the police showed up and verbally harassed/threatened me. should i file a complaint? (pennsylvania). i don't really know where to file this under flairs.

tonight, i had to call an ambulance to my apartment. my boyfriend was acting erratic and seemed to be in psychosis. he then had a full-on seizure. 

later on, i found out he smoked synthetic marijuana. i don't know much about that. i do not do drugs. i do not even smoke normal marijuana. i called an ambulance because i didn't know what else to do - i was scared. 

three policemen showed up first and entered without knocking. asked where he was. i started to cry and they told me to go in the other room as i was annoying them. i complied. then, the larger of the three cornered me in the hallway.

he said my pupils were completely ""blown"" and i better start telling the truth about what drugs i do. i told him that i have incredibly poor eye sight and my pupils have been naturally large since childhood - this is true. he told me, ""stop fucking lying to me now or you're getting arrested for drug possession."" again, i denied any drug use and told him he could literally drug test me through blood and urine at that exact moment - i am clean. he left me in the hallway and another man came out, rinse and repeat. then the third did the same thing. they kept telling me to look at lights and laughing and saying i was the biggest liar they had ever met. at this point i'm amped up and scared. i am a 23 year old woman. i am in nursing school. i do not do drugs.

at this point, they have the ems there coming or and checking my pupils and laughing. they were telling my boyfriend that he better rat on both of us or we were both going to jail. they ripped apart my whole entire room and starting laying into me for having cipro prescribed (an antibiotic). the largest policeman then told me he was going to speak to my landlord and have me evicted.  i reiterated that i am completely clean and could pass not only a field sobriety test but a drug test of any kind. he retorted with ""i highly doubt that"" as he continued to tear apart my home.

eventually, they got my boyfriend into the ambulance and all three of the cops left laughing. the largest turned around and said, ""congratulation on ruining your life. don't call an ambulance when you are on drugs, i'll see you around"".

not only am i shaken, but i feel threatened and ashamed. the man i was with should not have been on anything, but i called an ambulance because i was scared he might die! i didn't call them to be harassed. did they even do anything really wrong that i can report this? we live in a small town in nepa. i know that they heard a possible drug incident over the scanner and had three of them show up because they thought they'd find a good amount of drugs/an incident of interest. they found absolutely nothing. no one got arrested or charged. they also refused to give me any badge numbers and told me if i kept inquiring i'd be in more trouble.

"my coworker admitted to making false reports against my ex-boyfriend to get him disqualified from becoming a police officer.. about 6 months ago, my boyfriend was permanently disqualified during his application process to become a police officer. it was very odd as he's never had any legal trouble, he's never done drugs, there was really no reason to be disqualified. he has a criminal justice degree, he volunteered with the police department and he has background in security. the police refused to disclose why he was disqualified.

well after hanging out with a mutual coworker, he very openly told me he was trying to ruin my boyfriends life and he filed a report saying my boyfriend threatened him and was very temperamental and aggressive and that he was scared of him. they worked together and went to highschool together. 

he then told me to make sure i told my boyfriend because he wanted to start a physical altercation in order to get him arrested. he even told my boyfriend's brother, but he didn't say anythin because he didn't want to cause a fight. 

i feel like i'm in a very bad position. would showing the police our texts possibly get the disqualification reversed? is there anything i can do legally? it's been about 6 months since the disqualification and i'm in arizona.

"rover.com dog sitter lost my dog, hindered his recovery and damaged my work contract in the process.. i hired a well reviewed rover.com(https://rover.com) dog sitter to watch my dog on fri in order for me to work on a contract out of the city. i dropped my dog off at the sitter's house at noon on fri, and at 8:30pm he sends me a message letting me know that my dog had escaped. (something about his girlfriend and a open door) i break my work contract and race back to the city to start looking for him, and posted his info on several social media sources to get as much exposure as possible. i find out through bunz and fb that my dog was sighted about a kilometer away at 6:30pm, so this guy waited several hours before letting me know that my dog was missing.

i get into the city and start looking on foot. he informs me that he has called the police and tas (toronto animal services) and has ordered a set of missing posters to put up in the neighbourhood trough rover. he then tells me that he has a bunch of friends and family canvassing the neighbourhood looking for him. great right? this is where things get unpleasant.

it's -10c outside and as it gets later and my search gets wider i realize that i'm the only one looking for my dog. i call rover.com(https://rover.com) repeatedly and they say that all they can do on their end is encourage the sitter to go out and look, but apart from that their hands are tied. i get a tip from facebook that a dog similar to mine was brought in to tas, but i needed to call them for a more accurate description. i call tas when they open on sat morning at 8am, and discover that it isn't my dog. at that point they inform me that they never received a missing dog report for my dog the night before, and that i would have to submit one myself. (+12h after he went missing) this is the first confirmed lie from this dog sitter.

i continue my search throughout the morning with no leads, i double back into the neighbourhood and still don't see any missing posters or anyone else searching. i finally get a tip off to his location through facebook and catch up with my dog at a park that he is semi-familiar with around lunch time. this is after 17h straight of walking in -10c weather. i covered every street & alleyway in a 3 sq kilometer area because i was scared to death that my dog was going to get hit by a car and/or freeze to death. i couldn't stand the thought of going home without him.

i speak to rover.com(https://rover.com) again, and on a hunch ask for the missing poster order number and location. it turns out they were never collected from the staples that printed them. so this guy never had any posters in his possession and was never distributing them. i have them now as evidence.

&#x200b;

emotions aside, is there any course of action i can take to deal with this person? by lying about the search, the posters and the tas report he delayed valuable search tools that i could have procured myself and used in the search immediately. i also lost $1000 by breaking this work contract and have documentation to that effect. 

this guy really should not have any animal in his care, and pretending to go through the motions is worse than simple negligence like leaving a door unsecured. i'm at a loss for how to proceed. (if at all) 

edit: to clarify i did eventually find my dog, he's safe but it was a hellish experience.

"update: flneighbors/tenants cutting down my magnolia trees w/o consent. link to original post in case you need it: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants\_cutting\_down\_my\_magnolia\_trees/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants_cutting_down_my_magnolia_trees/?context=10)

i've received a number of messages begging for an update, but as it's only been a few months, i can only give a partial one, due to the ongoing legal issues (my attorneys have advised me not to divulge too much to anyone).

1) the day after my post, i called a good friend of mine who has been my go to plumber since i inherited the property (we went to high school together), to ask for his help. he went to both houses the next day, saying that i had called him last week since the water bill seemed high, and asked him to come look at the pipes. he went through the houses, surreptitiously taking pictures, while ""inspecting"" the bathrooms/kitchens/water boilers, etc for leaks. apparently while he was there they made a bunch of comments about me that included racial slurs (tldr: i'm biracial, and do not pass for white) and such about how i need to learn my place. after he'd inspected both houses he came over to mine, and gave me all the photos.

2) i conferred with an attorney regarding evicting them, and four days later both families were served with 7 day eviction notices. as expected, they blew up, and started throwing rocks at my house, slinging more racial epithets in my direction. i'd always grown up being terrified of angry racist white men twice my size, i never realized how unbelievably pathetic they actually are until i watched them crying like babies while being hauled off by the police on the video cameras.

3) the bride made a very angry post on facebook, followed up by standing up in church (small town, most of us go to the same church) during ""prayers and concerns"" to beg for prayers for her family because ""our landlord is evicting all of us because she's jealous that i'm getting married!"" the pastor, feigning innocence, said ""i thought she was evicting you all because your father and \groom\'s father cut down \my great-grandmother\'s prize magnolias?"" hardest game of you-laugh-you-lose i've ever played, still proud i survived.

4) according to the arborists (yes plural. though my friend came out and did an assessment, my attorney for the suit over the trees advised selecting someone who isn't so close to me for the paperwork we'll submit to the court), based on the number of trees cut down and the number of trees damaged beyond repair, and how old/well-tended those trees were, the value of the trees alone is more than i could sell all three houses for in the current housing market around here. then the attorney started talking about how the damages are multiplied and let's just say i would be quite happy with half that number, but i know when to zip my lips so i'll let my attorneys handle the negotiating.

5) they did, in fact, destroy the houses as best they could. i have enough savings/inheritance left that i can live without the rents for a while, so i'm using it as an excuse to have both houses renovated since they haven't had major renovations since well before i was born.

6) the bride and groom got married and had their reception in the church basement instead of the cul-de-sac. they had to cancel the honeymoon to spend the money on legal fees. (am i a bad person for being amused?)

7) hurricane michael just gave me some wild thunderstorms, thankfully passed over us with the worst of it.

8) my boyfriend of seven years proposed (finally, goddamn).

other than that, you'll have to wait until the eternally slow court systems process through. i do want to take a moment to thank you all for thinking of me, and being so helpful with your advice with what was a terrifying ordeal at the time. i'd never really stood up to my elders like that before, and it was comforting to know that not only did a gaggle of internet strangers have my back, but there were resources and protections in my community as well.",2
"ma a restaurant manager purposefully switched out my celiac boyfriend's non-gluten meal with a normal one due to her disbelief that he was intolerant. so i wrote about this last night just after it happened on another subreddit, and was advised by many of the comments to post here for some clarity on what recourse we could actually seek from this.

i won't be writing out the whole incident again in as much detail as before, but if anyone reads my earlier post and thinks i've missed out something crucial, i'll be happy to edit the post.

my boyfriend and i went out for lunch yesterday at a restaurant we have dined at before. my boyfriend is a diagnosed celiac and has been for many years, and when this place was recommended to us originally we were told the restaurant has specific gluten free items, and a specific area where such food was prepared to avoid cross contamination. we had a great time, and checked online before going back again yesterday and saw there were no complaints about people being 'glutened'. we arrived and ordered our meals, with my boyfriend specifically ordering a gluten free appetizer and entree, something that the waitress stated would come with a different sauce than advertised as the usual sauce was made in the general area of the kitchen and as such could be contaminated.

we have no issues until the entrees come, when my boyfriend is served a dish of pasta with the advertised sauce. the waitress thinks that there's been a mix up in the kitchen, and comes back a minute later to say that someone else has received his gluten free pasta and the kitchen were rushing out a new order. she said she'd comp our appetizers and try to get us a free dessert, something she'd have to check with the shift manager on first. we see her go over to someone we assume is the manager, and then minutes later the manager storms over and asks us what kind of scam we're pulling. she says that the pasta was definitely gluten free, and we tell her that because of my boyfriend's celiacs we were told that the normal sauce wasn't safe and were waiting on a new dish with a new sauce. she started to complain about fad eating and sensitive customers (something we attributed to us being young and therefore 'millennials'). the waitress came over with the new dish with the new sauce, but the manager snatched it from her and started to walk it back into the kitchen saying that the 'precious table' couldn't be served something that she hadn't checked. she came back a few minutes later with what we assumed was the same dish and wouldn't give it over to my boyfriend initially, sarcastically asking if she wasn't us to drag away the chef from their job and tell us ourselves it was safe. we said it was fine, and rushed to finish so we could get out of there, probably finishing our meals in about 10 minutes.

we flagged down our original waitress and asked for the check. she was a little while, and when she came back to us she looked like she'd seen a ghost. she told us that she'd gone back to the kitchen to check on another order, and noticed a pasta dish that looked exactly like the one my boyfriend had eaten sitting on the side. she asked if it needed to go out, and was told that it was the one the manager had brought back about 15 minutes before. the waitress said that she thought it had been brought back out to the customer, but was told that the manager had only come in and asked the chef working with pasta dishes to simply drain some normal, gluten-containing pasta and serve it with the gluten free sauce (my boyfriend had ordered a tortellini style dish and there was a similar one on the regular menu, so he wouldn't have noticed by appearance or taste alone).

the waitress had comped all of the food on our check, but i insisted that we paid for my dishes, and tipped her well over the average, just in case she was penalised for the manager's mistakes. she went above and beyond what was necessary by telling us the truth to help us in preparing for my boyfriend's future 'glutened' state.

my boyfriend started having a reaction just before we got home, and spent the rest of the evening locked in the bathroom having a serious response to eating a whole bowl of gluten. as of this morning the worst is over, but he is still having serious stomach pains that will be occurring for the next few weeks at the very least.

on my original post, i was given many different types of advice; i was told to both post and not post a scathing review, to sue and not sue the restaurant, and to get the police involved over a 'poisoning' incident or just go all vigilante on the manager. as i have been looking after my boyfriend all night, i have not been able to research any further, legal ways of dealing with this. as a note, my boyfriend has not and will not be going to the er or doctor about this - we already have everything we could possibly need to manage this, and it would simply be wasting time and money. however, if people advise that we need medical 'proof', we will be happy to pursue that.


tl;dr - my celiac boyfriend was purposely 'glutened' by an irate manager who didn't believe he needed a specialist meal, who and what should we pursue to get this manager fired and the restaurant investigated?",2
"update: i am a forgotten employee who has been ""working"" for over a year. i got found out.. i post this a year ago. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5psadr/i_have_become_a_forgotten_employees_for_a_few/

since that time i got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until i landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

recently i found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what i used to do, and pays more. basically tired of doing nothing even though im getting paid for it.  

the day after i mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office i got a phone call exactly at 8 am. the head of hr for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. i asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. she stated that there were no issues like that. they just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

i told her that they should have that information as head of hr and promptly disconnected stating i had to return back to work. she called back at 12:05 exactly. 

i have been ducking her calls ever since. her voicemails state that i am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. my emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. each time i am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. she calls at least once per day. 

i am thinking i just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away. 

how incredibly bad is that plan? before anyone says it. i know... i know ok i should have quit a long time ago. i did not.

"update: fiance may die, sister wants half of our house if he passes.. i apologize for formatting/grammar errors. i am on my phone.

my post got a decent amount of attention. i thought i would update since i still get really sweet messages from people wishing me well/praying for me and my family. 

my fiance, now husband did pull through! he's currently in our backyard setting up a tent to ""camp out"" with our 2 and 3 year old boys. he was in a coma for over a month and the doctor's were pretty sure he would never wake up. his recovery was slow and he still goes to physical therapy 4 times a week but he is pretty much back to normal now and we couldn't be happier! although it was a horrible thing to go through it changed both of us for the better. you don't realize how much the small things matter until they're about to be taken from you. 


he was appalled by his sisters actions when i finally discussed it with him. we recently both made wills and made sure there is no chance sil or bil will get any money if both of us were to pass, or god forbid our children too. we also chose godparents for our children and we are expecting a baby girl in 2018! 

i really appreciate all of the sweet thoughtful messages i was sent. they definitely made me feel better on bad days to know how many people were praying for him! ",2
"i adopted a dog. they said they gave me the wrong dog even though the photos match. now the adoption clinic is trying to sue me.. i live in texas and i recently adopted a puppy from a humane society several hours from my house. before arriving i paid the adoption fees via a phone call and then arrived and filled out adoption papers for the good girl. however the next day the clinic called and said that they had accidentally given me the wrong dog and that i needed to return her as some other family had also filled out the adoption papers for her to which i refused. they then said they were going to press legal action on the basis of ""stolen property"" if i didn't return with her within 24 hours. the dog i adopted is clearly the dog within the online photos that were posted for her and they handed her over to me without checking her chip..they said that they could be sued if i didn't bring her back and they didn't check the tags so are they not at fault for giving out the wrong dog?

the puppy i adopted is clearly the same as the one in the photos posted online and i've already bonded with her, taught her tricks and introduced her to my entire family over the last several weeks she's been staying with me. they say that even if i return her they still want me to pay their attorneys fees. please help me anyone i don't want to lose my dog and i don't feel like i'm at fault for their mistakes.

edit: the large amount of responses is greatly appreciated. it's an incredible help to me to be receiving many different perspectives on the scenario as well as slightly reaffirming to know that many believe the courts would be sympathetic to my stance in the situation. i am a young man recently graduated from high school and have never faced such a level of legal threat before and was honestly in a panic about what to do. i'm doing my best to read yalls responses and get back to you with any additional information you may have requested about the scenario.",2

apparently they are going after gas 1/2 mile east of our property but there was no road to the location so they are directional drilling from our property. we've paid an engineering firm to plat out our land to home builders, those plans were expensive and are worthless now. no one will buy a house with a gas well out their back door, lost every buyer we had lined up. 

we haven't been paid a cent nor have they called us back to negotiate the cost of damages, trees taken, lot buyers that have now backed out, and acreage they have taken.

"boyfriends ankle monitor is dying, his charger isn't working and no one from the house arrest company will pick up. what should we do??. trying to get this update out there proved to be harder than i thought. so i put my update here. 

op is still published at the bottom of this post

i know a lot of people were concerned about the reason behind my boyfriends house arrest sentence. which led to an entire post on r/bestoflegaladvice being dedicated to how gullible, stupid and naive i must be for believing his reasoning. whelp! he got off house arrest on tuesday (9/10) ((yay!! :)), i asked if he would mind if i uploaded his ""certificate of completion"" to reddit and he said that was fine.

certificate of completion (https://imgur.com/a/by974wg)

a few people asked some really good questions so i'm going to try to be as clear as possible:

he really was not on probation or parole. when he went to trial he was given the option to ""complete the program,"" which was a year with a privately owned house arrest company. if he failed to complete the program he would be sentenced to three years in prison.

the terms of his house arrest, as per the company's rules, where that he was allowed one grocery store trip a week and needed to provide sign-in and sign-out sheets for his daily work shifts. he could not leave the house otherwise unless explicitly approved by the owner of the company. every other week he was required to ""check in,"" which means he had to go into the house arrest place, sit down with someone, and provide receipts for his trips to the store as well as all of his work slips to prove that he was at the locations doing what he was supposed to be doing. he had to pay the company $60/week to be on house arrest with them (which was quite an expense but definitely better than prison). 

now that he has completed the program, he hands over his certificate to a judge to show that he served his time and he is now eligible to reapply for a drivers license (which was obviously revoked when he was ""sentenced"" due to dus charges).

he was never on parole. he was never on probation. this entire ordeal was due to being a ""habitual traffic offender."" a year of house arrest. for driving without insurance. he could not afford the insurance and was driving to get to work, to afford the insurance, he even switched up cars every time he drove. does any of that make what he did okay? absolutely not. but i did want to provide proof for those who were concerned that that is why he was put on house arrest and for no other reason.

tl;dr: my boyfriend was sentenced to a year on house arrest due to traffic violations, no other reason. he has completed the program and now we're going to the beach.

thank you for coming to my tedtalk i hope this cleared things up. sorry for the lengthy post.


certificate of completion (https://imgur.com/a/by974wg)


op:

title explains it all. what is our best course of action to prevent him from going to prison if his monitor dies before they open in the morning? i suggested maybe filming himself sitting at home for proof he didn't go anywhere. he thinks maybe he should call the police and go into the station so that he can be supervised, maybe put in a holding cell overnight so that he has witnesses that he didn't go anywhere. 

time is a factor. what do we do??

edit: thanks everyone for your feedback. he called, left a voicemail, sent a text, sent a video recording of the monitor and charger not working (he has been on house arrest for 11.5 months we definitely know what it looks like when it's supposed to be charging)((he gets off sep. 14! :)), his supervisor has an iphone so we even shared his location with them. everything we could think of.


at 12:29am we got this text back:
""sorry so late.. i have been traveling today and not near a computer or cell coverage. i looked it up and it should have showed you on charge but hasn't. either it's not connected or charger not working. still showing low battery. call the office at 9 and talk to greg about it. i'm sorry.""

crisis averted. sounds like we'll just stay put until the office opens and then we'll go in to get everything checked, and we'll be sharing his iphone location with them until then.

i would like to take a moment to address a few frequently asked questions:
1. we are in south carolina.
2. he is not on probation or parole. he has never in his life been convicted of a crime. he was actually put on house arrest because he acquired too many traffic violations (none of which were duis, which in my opinion is absolutely ridiculous).
3. the house arrest company is a privately owned business. there is a man and wife who charge every person they keep on house arrest $60/week. capitalism ladies and gentlemen.

thanks again for everything and if anything changes i'll let y'all know.

final edit: we went in to the house arrest place today after they opened, they gave him a new monitor, a new charger, a back up charger still in the box, and even knocked 4 days off his sentence!!! horribly, horribly stressful event had a relatively happy ending. thank you everyone who took the time to read and reply.

editedit: people are getting pretty mean, this got way out of hand. i want to genuinely thank everyone who responded to this post with helpful information when we were in need of advice, and our issue has resolved since then. i may make a separate post with all of the interesting information and developments that came about as a result of this once i get some more organized/tangible information, but honestly it's late and hate mail takes a lot out of you. thanks again to everyone who was sincere and wanted to help.


absolutely, positively, nonnegotiable final edit: okay kids, it's been a long day. we laughed, we cried, we learned a lot about ourselves. but at the end of the day, after grilling him, background searching him, and even calling his mom, it has become abundantly and unquestionably clear that my bf's current house arrest sentence is 100% due to three dus (driving under suspension) arrests. he was pulled over driving without insurance, three times. irresponsible? oh absolutely, he's known from the beginning how i feel about it. but, he is not, nor has he ever been, 1)in prison 2)on parole or 3)on probation. the disconnect was the difference between arrested and convicted, that is where i was confused and as a result confused some of y'all. he had been arrested several times when he was in his teens (a very, very long time ago) and all of them were for dumb teen stuff like petty shoplifting, which he never went to prison for. was that stuff irresponsible? yes. illegal?? also yes. but a long long time ago and entirely unrelated to his current house arrest sentence? you betcha. we had a good laugh about how dumb he was as a teen, he remembered a lot and i learned a lot. to everyone saying i'm dumb for believing him about his current situation: you had me really questioning things for a minute there and i'm sorry to disappoint you but that's all there is to it. he will be getting off house arrest on september 10th, and to celebrate we're going to the beach. the end.",2
"mylife.com has a profile on me with identifying information. their website falsely claims i have a criminal record. isn't that technically libel?. long story short, i googled myself and saw the first result was a link to a webpage for a company called mylife.

it's a little jarring to see that a company i've never even heard of has a profile on me with my pictures, my hometown, political party, and phone number. it's a little more disturbing to see them falsely claiming that i have a criminal record, which is the first result for anybody who googles my name.

it's not that big of a deal, but they seem to have this ""alert"" on everyone's profile saying that ""\insert name\ does have arrest or criminal records.""

i know anybody with more than two brain cells would realize that this website is a scam, but out of general curiousity, i was wondering if this would technically be considered libel, considering my record is perfectly clean save for a single traffic ticket for an expired registration sticker.

"resolved ne hoa tried to take my land. so after 6 long months, everything been resolved. this is my final post regarding this, already asked my lawyer if i could post this and he said go ahead. 

so here's my last update:  

https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7go96c/ne_hoa_towed_away_my_car_and_built_a_chainlink/


so the hoa board got a lawyer to respond to my c&d and they requested a meeting asap with my lawyer present as well. i didn't want to go but my lawyer suggested me hear them out at atleast. at the meeting, i noticed there president and some of the higher ups were not there. 

the board had no idea what the hell was happening and their lawyer was just as confused as them. after i laid out my timeline of events they thanked me for my time accepted all the financial burden of replenishing my pond, missing car (couldn't locate it), and damages. 

i got checks for everything and got my pond restored back in april and didn't really think much of it. 

i found out a few weeks ago from the new hoa president. turns out the old president, tresaurer and someone else had been stealing money from the coffers. they wanted my land to expand and put in a pool, clubhouse and etc just as i saw on their website. the old board fined everyone a ton of money to get all the cash together and buy my land. instead they spent it on themselves. they needed my land somehow so they thought they could just take over the land i wasn't using.


long story short, their entire plan fell apart after i fought back and brought to the other members of the hoa attention what they were doing. from what i've been told, they had to sell their house to pay back the hoa and have since moved away. the hoa has offered me market value for my land and i do plan on selling since i really don't use the land for anything and the money isn't bad.

i did not file any complaints with the postal inspector or anything, since the situation resolved itself. i got a new project car and for those asking it was a '98 supra with a bad engine. my new project is a '67 fastback that i plan on restoring to look like elanor. :)

i want to thank a ton of redditors for chiming in with advice including a few from nebraska.

"cousin needs a life-saving hysterectomy but insurance doctor won't approve because ""she's not done having babies."". my cousin has been getting these terrible infections after having her first child. after trying a few treatments, her doctor informed her she's at serious risk of life-threatening hemorrhaging and she needs a hysterectomy. however, when her doctor tried to clear it with the insurance, their doctor (who has never met my cousin) informed her that he would not approve of her surgery **because she's young and shouldn't throw away her chance to have more children.** he said, ""if you were 40, i'd approve this. but you're \young\ and only have one child so far.""

this seems incredibly wrong to me. i know people have tried taking on insurance companies before but how on earth would you start? thank you for any support at all. she lives in utah but the insurance company is based out of minnesota.

update: thank you everyone, especially those of you who reached out including doctors, insurance specialist, nurses and everyone else. i relayed all the information on to my cousin. her doctor had completed the peer to peer but she's begun the appeal process with help from a lot of your comments. i really appreciate all your help and she does as well.

"updateoregon neighbor cut down trees on my property. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72h3rm/oregon_neighbor_cut_down_several_trees_on_my/


hello legal advice community! i have not forgotten about you, who helped set me on the path to justice! i'll get right to it. i can't speak to all the details, and i'm sorry about not continuing to update (after everything got underway i figured it would be best not to). to keep it short, we (my lawyer and i) spoke to the police, who then spoke to the neighbors down and across the street (the one who witnessed my trees getting cut down) who stated they saw the neighbor and the company cutting down the trees, and then finally they spoke to him (neighbor). i don't know much beyond that with the criminal investigation, what happened with the whole city document or the company, and why that is will be explained below.


i hauled his ass into court. well, first, the arborist came, as did the surveyor. the trees were on my property and they were white oaks. the arborist gave me an estimate on having 15 mature white oaks brought and replanted on my property, which was just shy of $650,000, though he did say some trees would die and that would drive the cost up. i also had my property appraised, for the difference before and after losing my trees. it then became a question of whether i wanted to pursue my lost trees and see how much their lumber was worth, or sue for the replacement cost and loss of property value. basically, do i want the trees back or do i want the cost of the ones i lost? (apparently you can't have both).

well guys...

i picked the trees.

the actual court stuff started a lot sooner than i thought. we filed, a few weeks passed, and a few days before our day in court his lawyer reached out with a settlement offer. apparently he was wealthier than i thought. we accepted and while i can't speak to the details of it...

i'm getting the trees back!

it's going to take a long time apparently (several months, possibly all the way until september since the process didn't start until just this week due to the holidays), but i will have all 12 trees back on my property at no cost to me! my neighbor has also put his house up for sale, and i haven't seen him for quite some time now. oh well! there's a bit more to the settlement, but i don't feel comfortable speaking to that, hopefully that's understandable.

i remember some of the comments about whether the trees were a hazard to the road based on how far they were from the road. i ended up having to check with the county (not the city), and they sent someone out to measure and mark the boundaries. my trees were at least 5 feet beyond it (so outside the boundary). not even close! just thought i'd add that in.


anyways, there it is! i plan to take photos of the trees once they start getting put in, and of course once they are all in place and i have them back. i'll be sure to share them! i want to thank everyone for all their advice, it was a huge help! i didn't know you all were so into trees, but i'm glad you are!

"mother in law suing my wife for ""grandparent rights"". so today in the mail we received a letter from the county court of where my mother in law lives and she is suing us for ""grandparent rights"" a little back story.

\*courts based in upstate ny\*

over the last almost 8 years me and my wife have been  together her parents always have despised me cause i was a punk city boy and my wife was a good country girl. we moved in after 6 months and have been happy together since. we got married back in 2015 so we are coming up on a 4 year anniversary and things got better for awhile until we bought our first house and i got a job where i started making a lot of money. me and my wife now live a very comfortable life nice cars house etc.

back on thanksgiving of last year is when shit hit the fan. her mother said some very hurtful stuff about me and my wife to my brother in laws girlfriend, my wife and her are very close so she tells her everything and once the beans were spilled my wife confronted her mother about it. her mom made every excuse under the sun instead of just saying sorry she was wrong (we know she said it because there was text proof). we haven't talked to her only once or twice since thanksgiving.

today we received a letter in the mail from her county court suing for grandparent rights everything i have read they can only sue if we are ""unfit"" to be parents. my wife and i don't have any alcohol, drug problems, or trouble with the law we have been happily married for almost 4 years and our kids are well taken care of no debt etc. we also never once stated ever she could not see the children not verbally or over text. we just sold our house yesterday expected close is early may and then we are moving to south carolina this has been a plan for years and we finally acted on it back in december.

does she have any ground to stand on? does ny have any laws to that effect where they could force us to give them the kids for visitation? can this stop our move from happening and screw up the sale of my house? any advice is much appreciated.

"suicidal best friend checked herself into a facility while she recovers. she requested i take care of her children (1m 3f). her family took them instead against her wishes. (ut). my best friend is a single mom. the other day she had a mental breakdown and became suicidal. she has made an attempt on her life in the past years and years ago and knew if she didn't get help immediately, she would kill herself, and so she went directly to the emergency room. she has been moved to a behavioral health unit while she recovers mentally and is ready to go home.

she has requested that i take care of her children while she is gone. we are very close and her children love me. she trusts me completely with them. we have plans to move in together in soon. i am not a parent, but i have the means to take care of them and they would be happy.

i received an unnanounced visit from some of her family members (grandmother and cousin). they wanted to watch the children for a little bit. i was fine with this as i wanted to visit my friend to see how she was doing and stock up on food and supplies for the children. my friend was very upset that i let her cousin watch her children and requested i pick them up as soon as possible. she has always had difficulty with trusting her family and didn't want her cousin parenting her children.

her family doesn't want to return the children to me. they claim they are worried about child protective services stepping in. they believe/claim if the children are found in custody of a friend rather than family member that the children would be taken as custody of the state.

what can i do in this case? her children are in no way neglected and would be completely safe and cared for by me. i have taken time off work and will be with them 24/7. she even wants the children to be with me and not them. does her will not matter to cps? would they actually take the children if found in care from a non family member? or would i be completely fine caring for her children?

**edit: i have received a lot of great advice. thank you! i will be going to get the children asap. many of you suggested getting the delegation of parental authority completed. i can attempt to do so but she is only allowed an hour of visitation per day. she also has no idea what is currently happening with her children and with her mental state i am worried of giving her extra stress knowing that i am having difficulty getting them back. should i continue to have difficulty, i will have to get her to help with getting the documents signed. i would like to keep this as peaceful with her family as possible, which it has been so far. i understand their concern about cps and i'm hoping that the advice i receive will help convince them that they have no need to be worried and cps won'tbe an issue. should i show them my home and that i am 100% capable of caring for the children to alleviate their concerns?**

**edit 2: i have the children back. i talked with their mother on the phone and she assured me cps was a non-issue. she even insured that her family were not listed as caregivers, and another close friend of hers is. her friend is with me in this and believes i am fully fit to have them. still facing a lot of opposition towards me having them and i'm working through getting the proper paperwork signed.**

**edit 3: thread has been locked but i have received plenty of helpful advice. thank you for all of your well wishes. i have pumped up an air mattress for them as all the beds in my home are really tall, and they love it. the 3 year old calls it her balloon bed. i also found pillows that look like eyeballs and they think it'sthe coolest thing their bed has eyes. i am so happy to have them and relieved that they will be safe with me as we wait for their mother to return home.**",2
"kid reached over the wall and filmed my daughter while she was crying in a bathroom stall at school (6th grade) in texas. the kid then posted the video to social media.. that happened about two weeks ago.  it was initially pushed down to a guidance counselor as a ""friends issue"".  my wife went to the school about a week ago because the issue had yet to be resolved; a group of girls were still picking on our daughter.  since then, one the assistant principals conducted an investigation.  the girl that did the recording is still running around the campus with her phone, and now our daughter is labeled a snitch and bullied even more because of the way the school has handled it.

needless to say, we're a bit pissed.  our daughter won't be going back to that school.  we're not really sure what to do next.  do any of you fine folks out there have any advice on a way ahead?

edit: forgot to mention two important details:
1. the kid that did the recording...she admitted to doing it in a written statement to the school. she denied posting it to social media, but other kids have told our daughter they saw the video posted on music.ly.

2 .  our daughter has a 504 plan for anxiety and ptsd.",2
"second update i was fraudulently registered to vote. might get deported. help.. i just wanted to let everyone know that everything turned out fine!

uscis didn't give me a hard time about it-surprisingly. my lawyer was awesome and fully reported everything and documented everything. having an email from the club president admitting to it was great.

"update my father got my 14 year old sister pregnant.. a lot has happened since i posted.

i talked with my sister for a long time over the next week and she eventually agreed to talking to an adult at school. i went with her to talk to a teacher she was close with. after a lot of crying together she called the police and our school counselor and principal. they basically didn't let us go home that day from school. 

we ended up getting a case worker and parents of my sister's best friend (not the mom who was constantly harassing us about going public) took us in temporarily. we are currently still with them. 

the police visited my dad who won't admit to raping me or my sister, but they found a ton of child porn on his computer and other things they wouldn't tell us about. he has been arrested for the child porn. unfortunately, that did make the news and everyone knows. it's extremely embarrassing and stressful to have people judge you all the time. people wouldn't shut up about it for like two weeks. 

my sister moved to a different school that helps with troubled kids and special situations for while she is pregnant. we are hoping she can go back after she has the baby and continue at her first school... ideally.. 

she and i both have gone through a lot of counseling and she is okay giving up the child for adoption now. our case worker and counselor are both really great about this whole thing.  mom is still not in the picture.

i fully plan on changing my name to my mom's maiden name and so does my sister. my case worker says that's completely possible for us to do. thanks for that advice reddit, i got that from here. 

anyway, thanks for the advice. it helped me talk her into how serious it was.

"update ""my work's fun committee ignored reasonable request, hr told me to pound sand."". https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8826mu/ny_my_works_fun_committee_ignored_reasonable/

(new york)

a lot has happened over the last ten days.

i realized, shortly after making my initial post that my life, as it is, has become unsustainable.  i cannot live like this anymore.  and i mean that literally, because this realization came to me just before i hurt myself very badly.

i was sitting in my bathtub and it suddenly struck me that i was completely prepared to just stop living because i was too scared to find help.  so i went and found help.  

i took all of last week off and with my ex-husband's help, i found a good, understanding and very very patient therapist.  i've also made an appointment to see a psychiatrist, to see what medication options are open to me.

when i finally went back to work, i took the head of the fun committee aside and talked to her.  i explained to her that i have ptsd and some very severe anxiety issues and i apologized for not being more clear to her when i asked her not to do anything for my birthday.

and she cried.  she wept openly and apologized, she told me she thought i was just shy, that she was just trying to help me fit in and she never intended to do anything hurtful to me.  

then, i spoke to my manager and my workspace is being moved to a far less-populated part of the building, where i can just quietly do my work and be left alone.  it is literally all i have ever wanted.

so, the moral of this story was, fucking talk to people about your shit before it gets so bad you feel like you have no choice but fucking die.  apparently.

"(ohio) cop blocking my driveway and harassing me and my wife.. **edit** 

holy wow this blew up. thanks for the silver kind stranger! i received so many messages, so if i don't reply to your message i'm really sorry. i will go through and reply to as many as possible!

i have received so much amazing information on this post since i made it. unfortunately it is a holiday today and i am going to try spending today with friends. i am, however, going to follow up tomorrow with the police department and see if we can't figure this out. no updates or calls back as of yet... i'll keep everyone posted.

as of 12/31 at 3:40pm est i have called about filing a complaint with the police officer in question. i have yet to get a call back. i'll update everyone here when i get a call back (if i do.)

hello legal advice!

so, here's some backstory:

me and my fiance moved into this new place back in april. we've been living here since then. the town i live in is incredibly small and only has around 150-200 people, maybe more. the cops around here are notorious for pulling people over. there is a major highway that runs between here and cincinnati. they are most always out on that road because the city jurisdiction extends across that highway, they almost are never monitoring what's happening in town. 

fast forward until now. there was a cop sitting at the 4 way in the middle of town that my fiance had passed (she works with horses and drives a truck that's kinda loud). she was pulled over (in our driveway) for this exhaust issue. she took the loud exhaust ticket, paid it, we put a new exhaust that helped quiet down the truck, all is good. right? nah.

now, this guy knows where we live. he drives by all the time and he knows when my fiance leaves for work. he follows me now, in my 2010 honda civic (it's a completely legal car, no real reason for him to be following me) all the time as i do the speed limit, pay my taxes and abide by the law. there is an abandoned house across the road where he will sit at and ""clock"" people, however, it's right across from our home.

today was the last straw. when my fiance was leaving for work, we was headed in from town from picking up our cat from the vet. he is sitting at the 4-way stop sign in town. he sees us and makes eye contact with us and then as i'm almost home begins pulling out. my fiance needed to go to work, so i decided to let her use my car so that way there was no risk of her being pulled over in her truck (even though we fixed the exhaust like he asked).

on her way out, he sees her leaving and pulls up and blocks the driveway, not allowing my fiance to leave. he sits there for about a minute and then drives down the road a bit, waiting for her to pull out so he can stop her. she calls me and says she's afraid to leave, so i tell her to stay for a bit. he eventually pulled off and pulled over another loud truck.

here's the kicker. my ring doorbell has the entire occurrence of him blocking our driveway on camera. i've saved a copy to my phones storage. what can we do about this? this is clearly harassment and this guy doesn't let up. it's a shame when i'm fearful to leave the privacy of my home because this guys following us around in an unusual way. is there any way i can make a city complaint against him to get him to stop? i only fear this will make things a lot worse. cops are meant to protect and serve, not harass and observe. 

feeling lost here, could anyone give me some useful advice?

thanks, sorry for the long post.",2
"minor daughter refuses abortion.. tw: sex, minor

&#x200b;

throwaway for obvious reasons. i'm still shook and my boyfriend and i have been freaking out since we found out. i'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.

our daughter is 11 years old. we found out she was pregnant. she had always been close with a boy from our neighborhood, he's 13. we never thought anything of it as we'd known him and his family for several years since we moved here.

it was clear she had a crush on him, but i never thought anything of it. until she started complaining about things, i'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when i had been pregnant. 

i didn't jump to the conclusion, but i did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

they'd been having sex. god knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. i won't go in to details. because i never wanted to imagine them myself. 

we had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. my boyfriend was fuming after i told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

they knew as much as we did of the whole thing. they were as shocked as we were. we've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

but she keeps saying she wants a baby. and i just don't fucking know what to do. i tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  i was trying to be level headed. but she didn't seem to understand at all. we've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

what can i do? is the boy, or his parents liable? what can a doctor do? can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?  
i'm at such a fucking loss. my world is crumbling.

"i think my coworker's disabled son is stalking me. what options do i have? (ok).  i'm a high school teacher. i work in a very rural, very small school  and have been here for 15 years. ""dan,"" my ""across the hall mate"" has  been here 8. his son,""leo"" has some serious development issues, and  attended the school until he graduated three years ago. leo was somewhat  of a legend at the school. since dan was the football coach, leo would  serve as a manager at the games and the kids treated him well. leo would  often visit his dad's classroom before and after school and i got to  know him as well. leo became somewhat independent after graduation and  is able to hold down a very basic, part-time job that he can ride his  bike to from his home.

this past summer, dan and his wife went on a three week vacation for  their anniversary. they asked me if i would be a source of support for  leo while they were away. while leo was okay to stay by himself, he  cannot drive, so i would take him to get groceries and drive him to work  if it was raining. i also checked in on him every day with a text or a  call. the last day i was to be in this role, leo sent me a very  inappropriate text that included a photo of his penis. i told leo that  was inappropriate and that i would be telling his father.

i showed dan the text and he claimed that leo's phone must've been  ""hacked"" or ""played with"" while leo was at work. i didn't believe that  explanation, but i accepted it and moved on. the next day, my phone  started blowing up with texts from leo (more than 100 inside 4 hours)  asking me if he could ""hold on to me"" and ""take me for a ride on his 4  wheeler"" and ""kiss me gently."" i forwarded the texts to dan and did not  response to leo.

dan came to my house the next day and said that leo was not sending  those texts. he said he was going to take the phone and see what  happens. then, i started getting texts through some ""unknown number""  that were the same in tone and writing. a selfie of leo nude was also  sent. i called dan, thinking this might be something happening at leo's  job or something.

this didn't stop. i was getting 100s of texts a day from different  numbers. as soon as i blocked one, another popped up. i went down to the  store where leo worked and spoke with the manager. (i taught all of his  children). he told me that leo had been spending a lot of time on a  coworker's phone and he had already talked to dan about it two weeks  ago! so, dan knew this was happening and did nothing.

i changed my number, then school started and everyone was sent  contact information for all teachers. this included my new number. dan,  being in my department and a member of the faculty, got this  information. the next thing i know, i'm getting crazy texts again. i  said something to dan at work. dan said leo was ""harmless"" and i should  just respond to him because he liked me and the more i avoid him, the  more miserable it makes leo. dan even said those days that my number  stopped working leo became very angry and dan had to give him  medication.

last night, when i got home from work, my kids told me that leo had  come by looking for me. i was surprised that he had ridden his bike all  the way out here. the kids said he arrived in a car, but not dan's car.  my son guessed it was an uber. i don't want to sound like a paranoid  nut, but this whole thing is unsettling. 

am i being stalked?  
am i being unsympathetic to leo's problems?  
is it wrong of me to expect dan to manage his son's problems?  
what do i do next? 

i'm not going anywhere, and i doubt dan is, so we will be ""across the hall mates"" for another 10 years…

follow up #2(https://reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9svjmr/update_2_tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on/)

officially as of today jane has vacated my apartment, and building management has changed the locks. we were able to come to a signed agreement where she agreed to vacate the property within 7 days if i refunded her last two months of rent. (\~4200$). which i did. honestly between this and my other legal fees i am basically in the hole, and i would have been better off not having anyone rent my apartment. 

i talked to someone who is doing a story on jane, and they were able to confirm that she apparently works for a company rents out places on airbnb (said person who was doing a story basically told me they weren't going to pursue this anymore due to time concerns). she isn't a grad student nor is she even a student. 

i don't feel like i won, and honestly i just feel absolutely infuriated with the entire situation. airbnb to this day still has my place being listed on airbnb. who knows why she doesn't have keys anymore. 

my apartment is a disaster right now and from what my property manager has stated it seems like people definitely did smoke in my apartment. there are burns on my couch from cigarette, my dishwasher is broken, and pretty much everything needs a desperate deep clean. but my apartment is safe more or less. 

anyways i wanted to thank everyone for your advice. it probably isn't the best ending but it taught me an extremely valuable lesson, and i can go home at christmas and hopefully clean my apartment. ",2
"ne hoa towed away my car and built a chainlink fence on my land. so this is part 3 and most likely the final update for now.

link to past: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7cirxu/continued_ne_sold_land_around_my_house_to_a/


so i was away for the holidays and i came back on monday to find my project car was towed out of my driveway, my pond was emptied out and filled with gravel and sand and a fenced off 2 acres (2 chains by one furlong) of my property closest to hoa. i immediately called the police and filed a report regarding the stolen property. the car wasn't registered and was just an empty shell so i have no idea where it is nor will it be easy to track. it's not worth a lot (maybe $2,500?) but it's the principle of that jackass president of the hoa.


i had my lawyer draft up the c&d and sent it nearly 2 weeks ago and they haven't contacted me in any way except this. i hired a local salvage company to come tear up the fence this weekend and they are doing it free of charge since i'm letting them keep the fence to sell as scrap metal or whatever they do with it. 

my lawyer suggested i send up a letter demanding payment to fix my pond as it was filled in with gravel and sand. a local landscape company quoted me nearly $8,000 to get the pond back to the way it was so that is what he suggested i ask and another $2,000 for loss of use of the pond. the hoa has lawyered up so i think it's best i no longer post anything else on here until it's settled. i didn't want to leave you all without some closure since you all have been an amazing help. i've put a picture of the layout since a few people asked. it's bad but should convey the land.

"i'm pregnant and i want to leave my husband update. hi everyone,

i want to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who gave me advice and words of encouragement. i read every single comment on both threads about my situation and i really really appreciate the support and help. if not for the advice here, i probably would not have felt justified in leaving.

i'm sorry for taking so long to post, but i am now back home in nh with my parents. i feel like i'm coming out of a fog and i feel really stupid for believing everything; i guess i just justified it by assuming laws were different in the south. 

i left with just my computer, my phone, my documents, and a few family heirlooms. i'm not concerned about my phone being tracked as i am still on my dad's phone plan. my husband has sent me about 200 texts and has filled my voicemail completely but i haven't spoken to him.

i managed to withdraw half the balance of two out of three joint accounts. the third is a local bank and i did not want to stay in the area any longer. my parents told me to just leave the money. they are going to help me get the medical procedures i need and then they are going to help me pay for a divorce attorney. i thought they would say i told you so because they told me not to get married, but they have been very supportive and even offered to pay for me to go back to college and finish my degree.

"update - phd student here being accused of plagiarism. only that it's my own work that i used. massachusetts.. i posted earlier(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6n6lrr/phd_student_here_being_accused_of_plagiarism_only/) about a plagiarism situation with the university in my phd thesis.

to make it short, a few sentences in the thesis was too similar to what i had said in a couple of papers and my masters thesis. this wasn't a direct copy & paste, and  it was 7 sentences (53 words) out of my thesis which was a little over 95,000 words.

last week i got an automated email that an investigation has been started on the recommendation of the person that i talked to. the email explained that in case scientific misconduct is found, i will have a chance to defend my case to the board and the board will decide what to do, which vary from a simple revision and resubmission to presenting the case to the diciplinary committee for a serious offense.

i asked for appointments with a few people. head of the department, dean of students, and a head tutor to ask for advice. i haven't managed to see any of them yet.

today, i received an email that the investigation is over and they have found no evidence of misconduct or plagiarism. they apologized for the stress that this has caused. a little later, i received another email from the head of the committee personally apologizing for this mess, and explaining that the officer who i talked to had gone fishing rather than doing the standard practice which is not the policy.

so that's that. now i can graduate in peace. i cancelled the appointments and decided not to pursue the potential racism situation as there's no point anymore. thanks all for advice. ",2
"being sued for helping a choking victim (or). i was eating at a diner with some friends at 3 am, the guy in the booth next to us started coughing and gagging. i realized he was choking and went to help him, i had heimlich training at my place of work (i'm office safety manager for my floor). the guy managed to get the thing out and it flew across the booth. he looked really pissed, payed his bill and left. i felt like a little hero the rest of the dinner and then just kinda forgot about it. this was two weeks ago.
 
today i got a letter from a law firm that i'm getting sued for battery, they said i bruised a rib, i have no clue how this guy figured out who i am. i thought i helped the guy seeing as he probably would have choked without help. how did he figure out who i am? i never actually spoke to him. is this a real letter? do i need a lawyer for this?

"my college says if i miss class to testify at my assault trial, they'll drop me from my classes. (ia) i was sexually assaulted (while home over a break, not by another university student) and the trial of my attacker starts in two weeks. 

i am a university student about five hours driving distance from my home town where the assault occurred, and i'll need to travel there to testify at the trial. 

i'd spoken to my advisor and all my professors notifying them of the days i'd be out, and everyone was understanding, giving me take home versions of any tests or work i'd be missing. 

unfortunately, one of the days i'll likely need to be out coincides with midterms, so my professor was required to get approval from the academic dean and dean of the college to issue a take home midterm. 

his request for the take home midterm was denied, and when it came to the attention of these deans, they contacted all my professors and informed me if i missed that many classes (it would be approximately two of each class, maybe three depending on some court scheduling, and four of another class but it meets every day of the week.) 

my professors were comfortable marking these as ""reported absences"" which basically means there was a justification like a doctor's note or other official documentation. 

i showed the deans that i was in fact being called to testify by the defense so it wasn't  even really like i had a choice. i figured that would be enough documentation. 

the dean said that ""personal non-medical conflicts"" could not be counted as reported absences and would be treated as unreported absences, (so, treated as the same thing as if i'd just  slept through class). they suggested i apply for a leave of absence for the semester because otherwise i'd be dropped from my classes at the third absence and be on probation if dropped from two or more classes (school policy). 

this attack took enough from me already, i went to great lengths to be sure i didn't miss a day of school while recovering, i do not want this man to derail my life further by pushing back my graduation date. 

i spoke to the title ix office who'd promised me they could help, but it turns out their idea of helping was helping me plan my leave of absence. 

i do not want to take a leave of absence. all my professors were ready and willing to work with me and i was/am entirely capable of keeping up with the work. 

do i have any legal recourse here against the school?

well, a lot has happened since that day. my daughter is safe with me and was let out of the hospital about a week ago. she is getting better every day. i know though, you guys want the full story so here it is

&#x200b;

after i made that post i took the advice given to me and the next time i saw my daughter i told her that it was wrong of me to ask her to keep secrets and that it's ok to tell her mom. along with that i saw a lawyer recommended to me by a trusted party. when i went to see him he told me that this is ""a case lawyers salivate over"" and that my ex is in a lot of trouble. i immediately filed for emergency custody of my daughter. i also got into contact with the doctor again and explained the situation fully to him. he says that while he will not be getting lawyers involved that he wishes for me to submit the evidence to the police and file a report. along with this, my lawyer has gotten into contact with the court that originally ordered us to vaccinate our daughter and has handed over everything i gave to him. he has advised me to stay quite on this matter so i'll leave it at my ex is in a lot of trouble with them. 

&#x200b;

during this time, my ex started to get suspicious. maybe it was because a friend told her about a post on reddit and she freaked out? who knows. a few days later when i saw her at the hospital we had an altercation. she became hysterical and yelled various threats and insults at me. including telling me that i want to ""poison our daughter"" right in front of our sick child. she was escorted out of the building and the head nurse had banned her from coming back. after this she sent me a barrage of texts telling me that i am a monster and that if she had vaccinated her that she would be dead now. this was sent to my lawyer. as he puts it, ""she's what lawyers dream of when they hear who's on the other side of the court.""

&#x200b;

outside of this, i've been advised to stay as quite as possible so i'll leave it with this. 

&#x200b;

this week i received emergency custody of my daughter until our custody hearing later this year. i have heard that the da is slowly getting ready to move forward with a multitude of charges against my ex and that will land her in jail soonish.

&#x200b;

and that's really it for now. i'm going to follow the advice given by my lawyer and say nothing else to anyone. i do not want the media involved in this for a few reasons so i've left this as vague as possible. when this is all said and done, if the interest is still there i may come back again. but for now, thanks for the advice in the original thread, me and my daughter appreciate you all.

"what happened to my brain damage settlement?. when i was in 7th grade a man slammed into the side of the car i was in and effectively smushed open the top of my head. there was glass in my brain and small pieces were smashed off. my left foot was pushed to my head effectively snapping my shin. my heart ended up stopping for a while and i was revived. i went through brain surgery, pt, and alot of therapy for the mental trauma of still being concious for parts of it...

i hate to bring this up at all but i know i was awarded a very large settlement to be awarded in blocks in the ages of 21, 23, then finally 25. im grateful to be alive and i don't want to be a money grubber, but i feel that was rightfully mine or at least i have a right to know the details. my parents assured me that the settlement would be mine and it would pay for my college and grad school yet i'm about to be 23 and whenever i bring it up they tell me it's none of my business? 

again i really hate to do this but i'm not a money grubber. ive paid rent since 14 and always paid my way through college. it's just i want to at least know the details of the case instead of being told its none of my business...also my dad has bought two new buildings with money i don't know came from. i'm not saying i'd ask for it back, for all i know it paid for my heavy medical bills...but i still have a right to know. how do i do that without help from my parents?

edit: this happened in missouri, stl.
(5/5) thanks for the legal advice and ive been able to use case net to find my old case. unfortunately it looks like it was dispositioned by both parties for an out of court settlement? but i do distinctly remember being awarded a settlement. specifically when i was called into a corporate looking building to testify in front of alot of suits. i'll try and look into it by calling the courthouse and then lawyer. 

but im also surprised by the mass of hate mail in my inbox. some even depicting me to be a future serial killer headcase. despite my head injury i'm fully able to lead a perfectly normal un-serial killer life. thank you.",2
"update i allowed my sister to move in with me, dad tried to say i kidnapped her to avoid child support (ct to ny). update of my previous post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i\_allowed\_my\_17\_year\_old\_sister\_to\_move\_in\_with/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i_allowed_my_17_year_old_sister_to_move_in_with/)

&#x200b;

tldr: i didn't get in trouble for taking in my little sister and a court order for child support was issued.

&#x200b;

so, i had my day in court today for the child support hearing. dad actually showed up for court instead of using the option of conference call like my mother did. my sister (let's call her valerie) wanted to sit in the courtroom in case the judge had any questions for her in particular (he didn't, but i'm proud of how brave my sister is for going to court when she didn't have to) because i could feel my heart beating in my throat the entire time. 

the judge started out by saying he was unsure if a support order could be issued today given that valerie is now 18 and in ct would be ineligible but in ny would be eligible until 21 but then began asking some some questions.

dad did a lot of talking at first, mostly saying how he had a court order that gave him full custody of valerie and that mom was supposed to be paying him child support.  then he said how valerie dropped out of high school and left the state to live with me without telling him or getting his permission and how he didn't know for a month after the fact. he complained that mom never speaks to him about anything, that i make no effort to have a relationship with him and that valerie doesn't either. boo-hoo, we're all ganging up on him and he doesn't know what he did to deserve it, etc.  sure enough, as a few of you kind folks mentioned, the judge asked him ""why didn't you know where she was for a month if she was supposed to be in your custody?"" 

he then says that she was staying with her mother at the time but that she would've had a place with him and still does have a place with him if she had asked. at that point, sick of hearing him play the victim, i piped up and asked as calmly as i could manage ""why didn't she have a place with you 9 years ago when you dropped her off at mom's house, didn't tell her you weren't coming back for her and then got rid of all her belongings?"" 

my mother on the phone confirmed what happened and said that she asked me if i could take in my sister because of my brother's violent behavior early in 2017. valerie was 17 at the time she moved to nys and is still attending high school to earn her diploma (better late than never) and i've been her sole source of support ever since. 

the judge then reviewed the guidelines for monetary support. my mother, being disabled and on social security, was to pay no more than $50 per month for support. dad was to pay no more than 17% of his income, which translated to to roughly $800 per month. the judge asked me what amount i was looking for. my answer was that i just wanted some help with the groceries and her medical bills so i asked for a total of $250 from dad and the max $50 from mom. dad tried to haggle me down to $200 per month because he just bought a house last year (you should've seen the look on the judge's face). the judge reminded him that the guidelines recommended $800 a month and i held firm on $250. dad sighed and said he'll have to give up smoking to afford it (this is supposed to make me feel bad?). 

the judge made the order for support, effective until age 21 and i never did get in trouble for allegedly ""kidnapping"" my little sister.

thank you to everyone here that gave me encouragement to see this through and not fall for dad's intimidation tactics.

"ca i want to divorce my wife of 6 years, who has been a jehovah's witness for the last 4 years because of the extreme teachings of the cult, and how it could affect our children (3,1).. so i started looking deeper into all of this amidst my wife and i's simultaneous suspicions that her mentors within her church were ""poisoning us.""  they would bring us food all the time over a couple month period, and we were constantly sick.  since cutting those people out we have been better.  i want to the hospital to have us all screened, but they referred us to a social worker, who is talking with police on the matter.   

this is when i started looking deeper into this ""religion.""  long story short, i want as far away as i can from this stuff as well as my children.  i'm a military veteran who is 29, and has supported my family entirely up until now.  i have only been out of the military for a a little over a year now, and have bad anxiety and ptsd issues that have made attaining a job hard, so i'm living off my gi bill through the military (monthly check to supplement education post military -36 months), and military disability.  my spouse is hesitant to work, because the people in her religion tell her a wife should be at home.  

i thought i was being a supportive husband by supporting her choice of religion, but now that i've learned more, i can't.  i've tried to talk calmly about this to her many times, but it goes nowhere.  the religion is designed to warn her about people like me, ""worldly"" people.   she goes on talking about ""the end"" all the time like she is anticipating it.  i hate to say it, but i fear the brainwashing has potentially dulled her sense of reality.   even after knowing these people could have poisoned her own children, she defends the organization as a whole.  she doesn't want to go to any conventional counseling because ""other people don't need to know our problems.""  i have no idea what do to at this point.

i probably will be supporting our family by my previously mention means while i try to get mentally stable again to work full time over the next couple of years.  i only have about $15,000 in savings, and i own our only vehicle, a fully paid off car.  we have furniture and stuff but i'm not attached to any of it.  i have a life insurance policy that was converted from my military sgli to a vgli and that's it for assets.   other than that, no big debts or anything.   

over the last 4 years, this is kind of how the split has been raising the kids:

2016,17:  i was in the military, my wife would handle the morning routine with the kids because i left early in the morning and got home in the afternoon, and would play with the kids and help with everything like cleaning, brushing teeth, putting to bed etc.  the only thing i didn't do much was cook, which i only did maybe once a week.  



2018,2019 (post military):  i spent 2018 looking for and working several different jobs that didn't last long, mostly in part to stress and adjustment disorder, and as a result only worked about 5 months last year, which ate into savings. besides that, we have done everything in terms of taking care and spending time with the kids kids equal.

as i right this, i hide my children's easter eggs alone in the backyard, as my wife will stay in the bedroom today because of the ""holiday"" she is not allowed to celebrate.   the psychological effect of never having their mom around for birthdays and holidays is only going to get worse, and it's hard on me to have to see them do it alone. what kind of parent doesn't want to have fun with their children smh.   

what is a divorce going to look like with her? i really just don't want to give up my disability pay for life or my gi bill payments for school.  furniture, car, belongings can be split idgaf.  i don't want to pay her long term.

edit: omg i cant believe this took off. i'm literally crying.  people are sending overwhelming positive words and advice after i have felt so alone for years.  i guess this is locked now, so i'm not even sure this edit will go through, but i will post in the exjw sub., as that is what of a ton of advice has said to do.  thanks to all so much for your support from the bottom of my heart.  the selflessness of you all to help a stranger in a time of need is what i believe makes the world go around, and a lot of people could learn from.",2
"us citizen cousin (16f) is abroad and under heavy pressure to get married by parents. she asked for my help. update: we helped her & she's here. first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7h34dk/us_citizen_cousin_16f_is_abroad_and_under_heavy/

thanks for your help and for pointing me in the right direction.

my sister and i contacted the state department, the embassy and the consulate in karachi. they were able to verify that she exists and she's a us citizen. we told them of what's happening to her and they were quite helpful in telling us what to do and being ready to help her as soon as possible. 

the challenge was getting her into the consulate in karachi but she actually got herself there (took weeks of planning) where they gave her travel documents to be able to come to the us. we bought tickets for her to go from karachi to doha and then to boston where we picket her up from the airport. 

by the time her parents realized what's what she was on the doha to boston flight. her parents tried to apply for a visa to come to the us but their visa applications were refused. i'm not aware if the people at the embassy who refused it actually knew about my cousin's supituation or not but we're glad they weren't able to come here.

she currently lives with me and my sister and my sister has been granted guardianship over her. her priority is to learn english. 

her parents still try to somehow make her return but we've closed down the lines of communication and hopefully her life from now on will be stress-free. ",2
"update - the current owner wants us to pay for ac unit a year after selling house. this is the update to this post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z8ei4/sold_townhouse_a_year_later_ac_goes_out_new_owner/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

i know only a handful of people will read this but i figured why not do an update. 

we were sued via small claims court for half of the amount of the ac unit. the case predictably was dismissed as we didn't misrepresent the condition of the 14 year old unit.  

what was interesting is that he genuinely thought that we owed him the money. almost to the point of self righteousness. the way he talked about us; what he supposedly was told with nothing evidentiary to back up his claims. additionally stating that his lawyer said that his case was strong. his lawyer didn't manage to show up to court but still very strong case. oh well. it's over.

"accidentally 'drink and dashed' yesterday, would it be stupid of me to go back today and pay the tab? (eu). so there's this bar me and my bf semi-regularly go to, recently they changed the way they serve drinks. you used to have to go to the counter, order, they gave you your drink, you paid then and there, done. now they have a server who goes to your table and it all works like in a restaurant. except yesterday we kinda forgot that when we finished our drinks (a cocktail and a beer, about $4 all in all) and left. this morning it kinda occurred to my bf that we forgot to pay.

i know morally going back and paying is the right choice. but what if they won't take the money and instead want to get the cops involved? because right now they don't have any identifying information of us aside from descriptions, but if i go back and essentially confess, that's pretty damning, so should i go back and pay our tab?

edit: this all happened in eastern europe, part of the eu.

update: i felt really guilty so i went back there around opening hours. they were extremely above and beyond nice about it. apologized and explained the situation. they said it was nice of me to come back, but there was nothing missing from the till so there's no bother. i'm pretty sure we didn't pay so i insisted, but they were like ""don't sweat it, if you really didn't pay then this round was on the house."" tbh i'm so embarrassed i probably won't go back there for a long while, but i am glad i tried to do the right thing.

thanks for all the advice.",2
"atm gave me $1200 instead of $100. i told the bank, a different bank, called twice and sent them a letter. but i got arrested at work and spent the weekend in jail before the charge was dropped (mi). i'm in nursing school. an arrest for a felony will put my financial aid and chance of getting a nursing license in jeopardy even though the charge was dropped. i didn't even have $1200 in my account and i have a receipt from the atm showing that only $100 was withdrawn and my balance was $400 after the withdrawal.

i went into the bank as soon as i happened but the teller told me it was my money and so did the one beside her. they said the manager was not available. i went to another bank across town and i told the manger there but he said it was mine. i called their customer service twice and have recordings of both calls where they said it was mine. i mailed them a letter and i didn't spend the money.

then 10 days later i was arrested for stealing the money from the bank. i was at my job as a waitress when i was arrested and they fired me when i went back after i was released. it was a saturday afternoon and they told me i would be in court on monday. i told them i tried to tell the bank but no one listened. on monday morning i thought i was going to court but they gave me my stuff back and said i was free to go and the charge was dropped.

is there anything i can do to get the mistaken arrest taken off my record? i have confirmed with the police that the charge was dropped but not the arrest of it. it would be under michigan law.",2
"a 32 yo man picked up my 16 yo daughter from school (with her consent, obviously without mine) and they had sex shortly after. do we have any legal recourse? mi. the child is my step daughter. she was picked up from school after a half day while her mother and i were working. after she was picked up, they went to the man's place and had sex (it doesn't matter, but she was a virgin prior to this). 

she was then dropped off near our home and walked in our home before her mother or i were home yet. she met the man via a mobile app days earlier. this all came out today during her counseling appointment (she has ongoing issues with anxiety and a lack of friends/feelings of acceptance).

ignoring the fact i am unbelievably upset with her and will be dealing with that situation separately - do we have any legal recourse against this man?

i believe the age of consent in michigan is 16, but i do not know how that works as far as getting picked up directly from school without permission from parents and if that is allowed. to the best of our knowledge no pictures were exchanged.

fwiw i understand and accept the fact that my step daughter made this decision on her own, and that it is jointly a failure of us as her parents that this happened (read: i do not blame the man for this happening 100% as the step daughter and we as parents should have done better, but i need a place to direct my anger).

edit: one thing i forgot to include was she said he gave her a marijuana vape pen to use, if that matters at all. marijuana is now legal in our state as of a few months ago, but certainly not for a 16 year old.",2
"i was filmed against my consent at a party. (update). last post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5b1zon/i_was_filmed_against_my_consent_at_a_party/)

history: myself with another girl did nude dancing at a private party with our best friends. in a private villa where expected things to be private. a pervert had followed us and traspassed and took a video from a window and posted it online. i asked if we have legal options against the person.

we went to the police. myself, the other girl and the host of the party (owner of the property) to report it and see if the police will do something about it. they didn't. they said the uploaded video itself is not evidence for trasspassing and the nude/erotic nature of the video will not count as revenge porn, as there were people present at the party so we couldn't have an expectation of privacy.

it sucked. i didn't care about the video being out there as the chances of someone i know seeing it is probably less than getting hit by lightning (and even if they do it's not a big deal) but my friend was devastated because her family are very strict about these things.

but this didn't end there. this perv didn't stop. he tried to sneak into our other parties as well but we knew better now and we had security. they got him and handed him over to the police. so he was charged with trasspassing and they also found a camera on him with footage of women's bathrooms. they took his stuff and found out that he's been posting a lot of revenge, hacked and stolen porn and nudes online.

he's now locked up. our video is also down and his accounts on porn sites are suspended.

it took many months and him fucking up again but we finally got him.

"coworker/boss is threatening to spread revenge porn of me if i don't have sex with him.. so a guy i know work with somehow found revenge porn of me online. i thought i had gotten it all taken off the internet after a previous relationship but i guess he somehow found the video. we work in the finance industry and i do a lot of write ups and accounting for the firm. the guy is technically my boss, but he's about my age and it's always been more of a coworker relationship.

this is also because i went to high school with him, and we were preety good friends.

so, last week he calls me into his office and tells me, i'll just call myself h, he found revenge porn of me online. at first i was relieved that it was him cause i've known him for so many years and thought i could trust him. then he goes behind me and puts his hands on my brests, thrusts his groin into my back and tries to kiss me on the neck. horrified i push him away. he then tells me that he's had a crush on me forever and he'll delete the video if i come over to his place and have sex with him. other wise he will upload it to every website he knows and share the link with my family and friends.

we're from the same town and used to be good friends so he knows preety much knows all my relatives and friends. that day i just went home and sobbed the whole night. 

he's told me that i should come over to his place and have sex with him next weekend since he's doing me a favor. over the past few days he's cornered me and tried to touch me in inappropriate areas and has also been sending me inappropriate emails from a random account.

i feel so betrayed, since i thought we were good friends. and i'm definitely not naive enough to think he'll stop. i've been very depressed and suicidal the last few days.

if anyone else has dealt with this, how did you deal with a situation like this?

tl;dr- coworker found revenge porn of me online. he's been sexually harassing me and is threatening to share it if i don't have sex with him.

edit- many people are telling me to go to the police. it's sadly not as simple as going to the police for me. he is from a very wealthy family that practically owns the company. he's told me he will sue me for false claims, make it impossible to find work and spread the video to everyone i know if i don't have sex with him. 
also he's left no text messages, and all emails have been from random temp accounts. i'm truly dealing with a sociopath with a lot of resources, connections and money.

"i think my 3 year old is being sexually abused at daycare x-post from /r/parenting. originally posted in /r/parenting, but it was suggested i post here... edit per bot request: we are in california.

my son has been in the same church run daycare/preschool for about a year. at the time, we didn't love the place, but we were desperate because i needed to go back to work and it was the only place that would work with my part time schedule. (we didn't love it because it didn't seem as academic as others, but he was only two so we let it go).

he seems to really like it there. most days he doesn't even say goodbye to me, he just runs into which ever room they have setup and starts playing. he seems to like some kids and teachers more than others, but that seems normal enough. he occasionally has rough/clingy mornings, but they are pretty rare and seem to correlate with story time on fridays, but not every friday.

i'm not sure if some of his new behaviors are unusual or just par for the course for a toddler/threenager. he never used to mind diaper changes, but started kicking and screaming during them sometimes after he started at the daycare. he's always been a strong willed kid, but screaming ""i don't want to"" and ""put me down"" are things he picked up at daycare for whatever reason. i thought it was odd that the church pastor would be reading to the kids sometimes when i dropped my kid off on fridays, and even weirder that he sometimes had kids in his lap, but the teachers were always there and it was always a group activity.

we had some concerns, but nothing concrete and more that he was learning to hit/push than anything worse. until today. we finish up dinner and i get the bath ready for our 1 year old, leaving the 3 year old at the dinner table with my husband. i'm minding my business, bathing the baby when my husband comes into the bathroom to relay something the 3 year old just did and said. it should be noted that our toddler doesn't yet speak in complete sentences or fully respond when   asked questions (ex ""what did you do at school today?"" gets no answer while ""did you paint at school today?"" garners an appropriate ""yep!"" or ""nope!""). our toddler had finished his dinner and, after we had cleaned up his plate, he asked for peanut butter pretzels, one of his favorite snacks. normally, we'd say no, but he'd been a good kid all day so my husband said ""sure! but cheek kiss first"" and leaned into our normally very affectionate kiddo. our son slapped my husband across the face and said ""no! pretzels now!"". not great, but not out of the ordinary for him after a long day (we don't hit our kids, but he definitely struggles with hitting when he's frustrated). he did/said this twice and then said ""get candy!"". my husband said ""no candy right now"" and then asked ""do you get candy at school?"" our son then grabbed two of my husband's fingers, rubbed the tips with his fingers several times, said ""it's round, it's round"" and then licked them repeatedly. he did this several times. (just typing this is making me nauseous again). my husband asked if that's how he got candy and our son repeated the behavior/motion and then put his finger to his lips and said ""shhhh!"", then put his other pointer finger to my husband's lips and said ""shhhh!"" (we only ever use ""shhh"" to comfort them when crying and have never put our fingers to his or our lips). my husband tried to gently ask more questions, but our son just mumbled nonsense and then asked to get out of his highchair.

my husband came and told me immediately and we got the baby out of the tub, and tried to talk to the toddler again, but he'd moved on and just wanted to go sit on the couch. we didn't know what to do (this was around 730pm), so we called local pd dispatch and they sent over an officer who just told us to speak to the director of the school.

i've tried searching this sub and others and have come across a few sort of related posts, but i have no idea what to do. local resources open in the morning, and we have already told our workplaces that we won't be in tomorrow due to a family emergency, but we don't know where to start. i can't in good conscience send him back there again.

are we overreacting? do we just confront the director? how do we handle this? i obviously don't know what or who exactly, but this definitely seems off. any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.


edit:

first, thanks to everyone for their supportive messages and comments and for taking the time to reply. we are truly blown away by your kindness and thoughtful words. we are also very grateful for all of the advice.

second, an update. our son didn't go to the school today and will not return in the future. we didn't contact the school and we don't plan to at all. we'll be out our deposit, but it's worth it at this point. i have another center that we will be touring next week, but we are also prepared for me to stay home with the kiddos for awhile.

this morning my husband called cps and they said they only handle situations where the abuser is in the home. next, he called the state licensing board and filed a complaint. the school has an otherwise squeaky clean record, but we were assured they would be opening up an investigation and interviewing every employee at the school. finally, we called and then visited the local family advocacy center (basically relevant charities, social workers, law enforcement, etc under one roof). we met with a social worker and recounted the same points as above. when she was done taking notes, she called one of the onsite detectives who confirmed that without actual evidence (ie a verbal description of something from our son or physical evidence), there was nothing he could do. without the cops getting involved, we will not be referred to a forensic psychologist or have the situation otherwise escalated.  as frustrating as that is, we are almost fortunate in a way that that type of evidence doesn't seem to exist (or that we stepped in before it did). as many of you said, both the detective and the social worker agreed that the cop that came by yesterday handled it very poorly, but that there was nothing they could do about that either. the social worker mentioned that our son seemed to be a happy kid, not the withdrawn or angry type she's seen in more serious situations. we were referred to a center that specializes in play based therapy that we will be following up with as well. if anything comes out during those sessions, the situation will be handed over to the authorities at that time. 

i think that covers everything that happened today. my husband had to go back to work so i've been at home on the couch cuddling my kiddos. if there are any developments, i'll update again, but that is it for now.

thank you again for everything, reddit. you truly came through in our time of need ❤️

"i believe my hippa rights were violated when my surgeon's scheduler told my parents i was pregnant. i never thought about the situation like this but i had people point out that my rights may have been violated and i'm not sure what steps to take next and i'll try to explain the situation the best i can.

i am 24 and live in the usa and i'm on birth control but it failed. i didn't realize i was pregnant until i went into the hospital for something unrelated and found out i needed surgery for something and that i was pregnant on the same day. i quickly looked into abortion options but haven't been able to go through with it because i haven't had the funding but i'm trying to figure that out now so i can get the surgery and be healthy again. 

i went for my surgical consultation and the doctor said he would feel much safer waiting for me to terminate before performing the surgery but i would have to schedule the surgery through his assistant a. a called me shortly after the surgical consultation and pressured me the entire phone call to keep the baby but when i told her i was planning on going through with the termination wouldn't schedule my appointment until i had gone through with it. so i've had to put the appointment off and wait until then, which is fine, but my parents are in on why i need the surgery and i've had to come up with excuses as to why i can't schedule it yet because i don't want them to try to pressure me to not terminate. 

fast forward to last tuesday and i get a text from my dad that says something to the effect of 'we know why you haven't scheduled the appointment and we're very disappointed in you.' it turns out that they called the office and the assistant disclosed my pregnancy to my parents and it's causing me a great deal of emotional turmoil because my parents have been acting super weird around me and now i'm doubly stressed about the situation. i never gave her or anyone else to disclose my medical status to anyone and i feel like my rights as a patient have been violated.
 
i guess my questions would be: do i have grounds for legal recourse, what would my next steps be and what should i do from here.

edit: fixed a word bc i don't proofread

edit edit; thank you so much for everyone's kind words, this has helped me immensely and i appreciate all of the advice i've gotten and am continuing to get. i am so grateful that i have been met with nothing but kind words and thoughts,",2
"i am an american citizen. yesterday, at lax, i was forced to provide my social media and whatsapp information before being allowed back into my own country. can customs/passport officials ask for this information?. us-ca  united states - california

what the title says. yesterday, i got back from a trip overseas back to us. at lax airport, i was forced to provide my social media and whatsapp information. when i asked why they needed it, they said ""social media is the best way to get to know someone, we have to ask for this information to check you""

is this legal? would i be arrested if i kept refusing to provide this information?

after providing the information, i was thanked for my cooperation and allowed back into my country.

thanks.",2
"in 4 days ago i accidentally almost got into the wrong car, causing the elderly woman inside the car to try to flee and she fell. today i was told i'd be sued if i didn't pay ambulance & er bills.. 
four days ago (monday 11/4) i was parked in a very full parking lot and returned to my car in a distracted state. i didn't realize that i was parked next to a car that was identical to mine. i opened the unlocked driver's side door and put my leg in, but immediately withdrew my leg because i heard someone inhale sharply and then heard the passenger side door open. obviously this wasn't my car so i began apologizing and, as i was shutting the door, i could see an elderly woman struggling to get out of the car.

i was still apologizing when she fell out of the car. i went around quickly and asked if she was alright, did she need me to call an ambulance, did she need me to go find whoever she was waiting for, etc. she told me i didn't need to call an ambulance, but asked if i would stay with her until her daughter came back. she didn't know which store her daughter was in and didn't have her number memorized. i helped her back into the passenger seat. 

she had an abrasion on her right palm, which i offered to disinfect since i keep a first aid kit in my car. she accepted and said she wasn't hurt anywhere else, just shaken up. she asked me for water and i gave her a bottle from my car. she told me she was diabetic and that her blood sugar was low and she didn't have her insulin with her, so i offered her a banana. we spent about 5 or so minutes together before her daughter came running up.

we explained to her what happened and the daughter was pissed at me, rightfully so since i did scare her mother and she fell. i offered again to call an ambulance to make sure she was alright and they both refused. i suggested they take her to her doctor as soon as possible to make sure she didn't injure anything from the fall. i apologized again and went home. 

this morning the daughter and her husband showed up on my front porch. i think they were trying to intimidate me since the husband stood there the entire time with his arms crossed and with what i assume was supposed to be a scary look on his face. 
the elderly woman and i only exchanged first names so i don't know how they found out who i am or where i lived. i asked and they said they ""had their ways."" the daughter told me she ended up calling an ambulance because her mother began to have a panic attack before they left the parking lot. i asked if she was okay and she told me that wasn't any of my business. she said that they were going to sue me if i didn't pay the er bill and the ambulance bill. they said they wanted $3,500. i asked if her mother had insurance and was again told it wasn't my business. i asked to see the bills because i obviously have my doubts and they said they didn't have them with them. i said ""so you expect me to just hand you $3,500?"" and that pissed them both off. i told them to get off of my property and that i'd call the police if they refused or came back. i told them to have their lawyer contact me. they both called me a bitch and left. 

i've included every detail i can think of, so my question is could they really sue me? i understand you can basically sue anyone for anything, but am i legally responsible to pay these medical bills if they do in fact exist? 

thanks in advance. i'm on mobile, so i apologize for any formatting errors. 

edit: thank you to those who responded. i'm 31, but often get mistaken for someone much younger. the daughter and her husband are, or look to be, in their mid to late forties. i suspect they may just have seen what they think to be a young and naive woman that may be dumb/scared enough to pay them.

i do have a home security system. i can also defend myself should my home security system fail. thank you to those voicing concern for my safety.

i don't know much about diabetes. the woman told me she was lightheaded, that she had diabetes, and that her blood sugar was low. she asked if i had any food and i gave her the banana in my purse. she specifically mentioned not having her insulin with her.",2
"update tenant is renting out my apartment on airbnb. tenant isn't responding, airbnb doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. i have no idea how to even handle this.. location: toronto, ontario

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant\_is\_renting\_out\_my\_apartment\_on\_airbnb/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on_airbnb/)

just wanted to thank you all for your support/advice, i was really dumb and naivee when it comes to renting out my apartment. the last time i rented it out the tenant left on time, and i never actually thought about what could happen if they didn't leave.

i have started the process of evicting the tenant today, with support from a local lawyer who is going to handle a bunch of the paperwork for me, and represent me.

my condo board thankfully has been super understanding as soon as i outlined that it was being done without my knowledge, and they have agreed to wave the penalties. apparently there were noise complaints on friday relating to my apartment which annoyed our condo board. our concierge service (we have someone at the front desk 24/7), will no longer be allowing people to leave keys for people at the front desk.

on sunday two people came in to the building asking for keys to my unit, and our concierge  service asked if they were airbnb tenants, and they said yes. he then basically told them to leave right away, and they aren't welcome here.

jane finally got in touch with me today, and basically accused me of numerous things, from harassing her renters, to just in general making her life difficult. she also stated that she will be going to the ltb to ""make a formal complaint because banning airbnb is not allowed"". when i pointed out that as people have told me here that she needs to get  my permission before renting out to other people. she went a rant about how she is doing this for numerous places and how she has never had a problem and ""how stupid i am for making her my enemy"".

i have a ton of proof of what she is doing, honestly my biggest concern is what is going to happen to my apartment. i asked a friend to book my room for one night through airbnb for tomorrow (as it just apparently became available for rent), and take a look at the state of my apartment.",2

however with the song recently charting on the american billboard charts i thought there might be another angle, for performance rights at the very least. do i and the other singers have a case? if so how should we proceed?

apologies if this case is against the sub rules but i'm kind of out of my depth here...

"(ok) mom passed away and things aren't adding up.. update

the last 48 hours have been a rollercoaster of emotions to say the least.  i kinda feel like i'm living in one of those crime novels. at one point, i seriously considered walking away from it all because there were enough things that took place to make me feel like it was a possibility i might find myself having some kind of ""accident"" in the near future. 

i obviously won't be able to share too many details...at least not yet...but i do want to let everyone know i have an attorney, as well as a private investigator who is a retired fbi agent with a lot of connections. as of today, i have finally been able to locate my mother's body and it has not been cremated. i also have been granted access to her property.  a lot of things are missing.  the vehicle has been reported as stolen as well as a few other items... which i'm sure the list will grow as we continue to go through her belongings. 

thank you to every single one of you who offered your help, resources, experiences, and condolences. i will never be able to express the amount of gratitude i have for your willingness to help a stranger you've never met. you guys are amazing!!

to those of you that called me a karma farmer and questioned the validity of my personal hell...i hope you step on legos barefooted and catch your pinky toe on the coffee table. when you do, think of me.




i'm not really sure what to make of all this and i could really use some insight on the matter. evidently my mom passed away last wednesday june 5th...i say evidently because my brother and i weren't notified until yesterday evening of her passing. 

i'm not entirely clear on the details because the circumstances are not adding up and i'm afraid if i try and explain the chain of events... it'll become extremely confusing but i feel like the manner in which this was handled seems fishy.  

we first learned of the news from a friend of our mother's who says she recieved a phone call yesterday (4 days after my mother's passing) from someone claiming to be a sheriff of the county my mother resided in, informing her my mother had passed away and asked if she happened to have keys to my mother's house because they were trying to locate next of kin. (see...weird huh?) he claims he found her number by going through my mother's phone (which would've been with her in her house, where they found her so why do they need keys) she told them she did not have keys but they could try calling her children (me and my brother) or her brother (my uncle) and that our numbers should also be in the same phone. 

my mother's friend calls me to ask what was going on and did something happen to my mom and while i'm talking to her, my uncle calls me... which is odd because i haven't spoken to him in over 10 years and i wasn't even aware he had my number. he immediately goes into this whole story about how my mom passed away last wednesday of a massive heart attack in her home and the police from her town contacted him after they were sent to her house to do a welfare check and found her. they supposedly went through her phone and saw he was the last person she talked to so they contacted him first. then without skipping a beat or even giving me a chance to process all of this,  he goes on to tell me that my mother had informed him on multiple occasions that she was leaving everything to him and that he was to make sure my brother and i, were to receive none her belongings and he kept mentioning his good friend sheriff whats-his-nuts ( fake name for obvious reasons) and his attorney have both informed him he was not to contact my brother or me about the situation and that since my mother left him everything, he needed to remove what he wanted from her home and donate the rest to salvation army. he was making arrangements to have her cremated and would let me know if he decides to do a funeral... then he hung up.

how is that even possible? can he do that? i mean even if by some crazy off the wall chance my mother lost her mind and created a legal living will that named her brother... who's almost 15 years older than my mother by the way... the executor of her will and she left everything she owns to him...is there not some kind of reading of the will my brother and i are required to attend? is this how this stuff goes down? i really can't be involved in making funeral arrangements for my own mother? never once had our mother ever mentioned she had a will and i can not fathom her leaving everything to my uncle. but my feelings aside what is the legal process here? how could i find out for certain if there even is a will? 

the situation gets a little crazier because after i called my brother, he calls my uncle and is told the same thing... they argue a little over the phone and it's now turned into my brother and i are allowed to accompany my uncle to my mother's house, and ""rummage through what's left to see if there's anything we want"" but it has to be this coming wednesday because he has meetings all day tuesday (today) with a probate attorney to iron out the details of my mother's estate. to my knowledge he's already taken her dog and her brand new car, into his possession. 

this makes me think there is no will. if there was a will like he originally claimed, and my brother and i were to receive nothing... how are we all of the sudden allowed to look through what's left?

i'm extremely uncomfortable with this situation. 

the most disturbing part of this whole ordeal is, i know my mother was working on the legal details of an invention she recently had patented and was in the process of interviewing manufacturers to fabricate her invention.  she reviewed all the legal paperwork with my brother and me a few months ago...i'm worried that's why my uncle is in such a hurry to hire a probate attorney, and throw names of law enforcement friends of his (he himself is a retired police officer) which would also explain why it took him 4 days to notify my brother and me about her passing. 

isn't there some kind of chain of command that has to be followed when it comes to notifying next of kin? is there a certain legal process that needs to happen when a person has a will?? or even if they don't?? sorry for the long post. i'm still trying to understand all of this. it just doesn't seem to make any sense. who should i contact first? the police in her area? an attorney? what do i do?

update: i can't respond to anyone now that its been locked but to answer a few questions. no i haven't seen the body though my own eyes and neither has my brother. he and i are getting together today to get a lawyer. this is in fact very real and i'm not making it up at all. i created a new account in hopes of not being recognized as this is turning into a very tricky situation. my brother and i are both very overwhelmed at the moment and we're in a bit if a situation where we aren't exactly sure who we can trust.  as far as my  motive behind mentioning my mother's invention...evidently that was precieved as making this entire thing seem like a made up story. all i can tell you is, sorry i didn't disclose that in a manner which made it more believable for you. i guess i'm poorly communicating the events i've been through recently and to be honest, i'm trying more so to get actual advice, not to make sure you believe me.",2
"pa landlord from 6 years ago is telling me he forgot to cash my rental checks. am i obligated to send him new ones?. my landlord of six years ago sent me a letter with photocopies of old checks i had sent him. according to him, he forgot to cash said checks and is requesting new ones. there are several checks and the total amount is not insignificant.

i'm in a fairly tight spot myself at the moment handling a mortgage, house repairs, etc. i don't see how i could pay back the requested amount without causing undue stress on myself.

can my former landlord pursue legal action against me? is there some sort of statute of limitations on this?

"tx - my pregnant ex girlfriend is told several lies about me and got me arrested. kid was born and turns out not my kid. she just called me.. ex was a one night stand with no protection. she gets pregnant and we assume its mine. 

things go to shit and we break up. talk of custody and child support comes up and i tell her i was going to try for custody.

three hours later i am picked up for questioning. i refuse to answer any questions, get a lawyer after release and find out i have a restraining order against me. 

the kid is born. dna test is done and its not mine. 

since all of this started i have been recording all phone calls on my cell phone because cya has literally saved my job. 

i just got a phone call from an unknown number. it was my ex. she said since she was using a friends phone and wanted to apologise. i told her we should not be talking. she agreed and apologized for lying to the police about the rape. 

i immediately hung up the phone. i have her on recording admitting to false rape reports to the police. 

will i get in trouble for this? i made no effort to call her and she called me. the call lated 1:28 seconds and i hung up on her. 

second question. what are the chances of using this recording to get restraining order dropped?

third. what are the chances that dallas police will arrest her for the false claim?",2
"someone threatened to kill me at the gym. i live in brooklyn.

i was going to the gym and returned what looked like a forgotten phone to the desk.

the man came looking for his phone and i told him i brought it to the front desk.

he became extremely agitated and demanded me to go get it.

when i said no, he became more enraged and threatened to beat me up.

he threatened to kill me several times.

he broke my headphones and when i approached the front desk for help he snapped my phone in half.

he threatened me several times and said he would kill me/snap my neck like the phone.

no one at the gym batted an eye, said anything or helped.

he never punched me, because i reminded him of the cameras and the police, but he was extremely imposing and like i said did threaten to assault me several times per minute.

my question is should i go to the cops?

i just don't know if the brooklyn police will do anything and i am worried that he or his friends would actually assault me should i go to the police. 

i am also worried that the front desk might give away my information to him since he is a long time member. i think they only have my credit card info, but still.

"(texas) power of attorney seems fishy?. so, i'm 29 and my parents don't allow me to get a job or move out on my own and every time i try to, they threaten me with this. i do have mental disabilities, however i am fully functional and i also have never been diagnosed. this leads me to questioning the veracity of my parent's threats. i do remember my parents dragging me into an ssa office when i was younger and they made me sign some document without me reading it. they just told me to sign it without question and being my parents i didn't think to question them. later they told me that i had signed away my rights (their phrasing) and that they now have power over me. every time i try to run away they also threaten to call the cops and they tell me that since i'm disabled and i have no guardianship over myself, whoever i go to can be charged with kidnapping since my parents didn't consent. i'm also not allowed to have friends or anything because they use this to dictate my every move. they tell me i'm crazy and helpless and i can't be trusted and that's why for my own good they got this thing.

&#x200b;

other things that might be important that make my question things:

they don't care about my well being. they don't allow me to go to therapy even when i've asked. they refuse to allow me to see a doctor and when i finally did, they threw away my medication because they claim it was bad for me. i know for sure i do have a mental disability, i just don't know what and once again, they've never took me to get diagnosed let alone therapy. they've always been controlling and i wonder if this is just another method. i get too scared to call suicide hotline when i'm depressed because they had me convinced for the longest time that, quote, ""they'll lock you up in a mental asylum for life and take away your phone and never let you talk to the people you love ever again and they'll treat you like you're crazy."" i've since learned this is obviously not true, but it's ingrained in me now and i have a hard time seeking help. i feel that this is also yet another form of control.

&#x200b;

anyways, how do i go about verifying if they really do have this thing over me? what are their rights if this is true? what are my rights? can i, i guess appeal (not sure if this is the right word)? what can i do about this?

&#x200b;

is there any other legal advice y'all can offer that i haven't thought about asking for? can i do anything about how controlling my parents are, legally speaking? can they really deny me therapy and medical care?

&#x200b;

i should also i add they sabotage any jobs i try to work because of the poa thing. i currently help my mother around the store they own and they pay me randomly and i'm not on any official payroll that i know of. is this also legal????

i have so many questions and i feel so helpless and lost. i'm sorry.

"employer lured me with an offer letter that has terms that are impossible to meet.. i graduated from pharmacy school in june of 2018 and i was hired by a pharmacy chain to work in california. i went to school in a nearby state and had to move for this job. 

my offer letter says that i have 90 days from graduation to get licensed. it is not possible to get a pharmacist license within 90 days of graduation in california. the process takes about 4 months. i was verbally told by my district manager that the letter is the same in every state and that they don't enforce that 90 day rule.

i moved, passed all the tests, and got licensed in october. i was put on the schedule for only 16 hours each week. the schedule is for several weeks ahead. i brought it to the attention of our scheduler and the district leader. i was told that i might get more hours at some point if i learn to work more efficiently.

i pointed out that my offer letter says full time work. he says the term isn't legally defined and it can be whatever the company defines as full time. he also said that the offer letter was void because i didn't get licensed within 90 days. he said that if i work with more urgency and get my speed-based metrics up, then everything will be just fine for me.

is he correct about all this? i went on the company website and they define full time as 30+ hours in order to get health benefits.

 i don't know a lot about the law, but it feels like it would be illegal to lure people with an offer letter that they know has requirements that are impossible. the board of pharmacy has lots of documents available online which show that a 90 day requirement is impossible to meet.

"mi, usa considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now i have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear. i have a big family, with around 20 cousins,  10 aunts and uncles, and several others who always show up to family  reunions. i'm a male in my 20s.

last weekend we had a family reunion in a cabin resort in the woods. on the last night there, while everyone was sitting by the campfire, my uncle (by marriage), snuck up behind me and blasted an air horn about a foot  or two away from the back of my head. this air horn was not a normal little one you often see at sporting events. this campground has bear  around, so they keep several large air horns around the place to be used to scare off a bear in case they get too close.

as soon as he did it, everyone called him an asshole and got angry at him. he showed no remorse whatsoever. he laughed about it, telling us how he and his friends from work have blown air horns at each other before as a prank.

i was so furious when it happened that i didn't know what to do. i sat there quietly stewing in my rage for a while. i wanted to beat the shit out of him or hold him down while i emptied half of the air horn directly into his ear. but instead i  walked away eventually and spent the rest of the night in my room. it's important to know that this uncle was hosting this reunion. it's a ""corporate retreat campground"" that his company lets employees use.

he clearly knew he fucked up because he attempted to apologize the next day, but it was a pretty shitty apology. while everyone was sitting down for breakfast, he snuck up behind me, put his arms on my shoulders and quietly said, ""i heard your ears were ringing. sorry about that."" he didn't even say it to my face, or say it loud enough for anyone else to hear. i grumbled something about ""it's okay,"" but i absolutely do not forgive him.

this happened last saturday, a week ago. for the first couple days my ears were literally sore, and any loud noises were painful to hear. since then, my ears have been constantly ringing. it's the worst when i'm in a quiet environment, like  trying to work or go to sleep. i hear this high pitched sound that is driving me nuts. sometimes it'll start to subside, but it still comes and goes. i think i could have permanent hearing damage.

this  guy has been giving me shit since i was a young kid, so this was not a one time occurrence, though this was definitely the worst thing he's done to me by far. i've contacted a personal injury lawyer in my area to learn about my options, but i figured some people here might have good info as well. i won't hear back from the lawyer until tomorrow at the earliest. any info is appreciated. suing my uncle would tear a huge hole in my family, but i really don't care about that if i end up having a ringing in my ear for the rest of my life. it's interfering with my ability to sleep and work. thanks for any help.

"worlds fastest update - refused dna test (ca). while i was getting my ass handed to me in this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9is8jh/refused_dna_test_california/), a coworker confessed to the assault. from what i hear, the dna tests were just a threat to put pressure on this one dude who they suspected, i don't think they actually took anyone's dna.


many people pointed out that i sounded sketchy in my original post. that was probably true. i'm a recovering addict (three years clean and sober), and i did a lot of crazy stuff in my past- not raping anyone, but junkie shit like breaking and entering, squatting, getting in fights, etc. i didn't know you could get a paternity test for an unborn baby, so i thought they were just going to put my dna in a database, and maybe things i never got caught for would come up. if i knew i was just being tested against a baby, i would have said sure.


i want to say that *because* of my past, i'm a squeaky clean employee- i never so much as swipe a snack from the pantry or an advil from the med cart. we're not supposed to ever be alone with members, and i never am, even if i'm just dropping off a tray in someone's room, or if a member has work detail in the kitchen. i guess i was acting paranoid because i was pissed about being suspected when i've tried so hard to be straight, and that ended up making me seem more suspicious. 


hopefully now that the guy who did it was arrested, things can go back to normal. i hope the woman who was raped is doing okay (she's not here anymore, and i don't know what is happening). sorry for the novel, but i wanted to let everyone know what was going on. 


**edit:** i think the reason everyone was so mad at me in the original post was because i was acting like *i* was the victim, even though obviously that was not the case. that is some of that addict mentality, that i'm still working on with my sponsor.",2
"a 15 year old girl made false allegations to cps about my 8 yo son because she doesn't like my 15 yo daughter.. my daughter was close friends with a girl for a few years and they had a falling out over ridiculous things. i don't want to go into too many details because the reasons are very specific and the family would immediately know i was talking about them. 

the girl's mother is crazy and she likes to threaten people with legal action and throw her job title around (she does not work in law or any real position of power... she just has delusions of grandeur). the mother also believes her daughter is perfect and everyone is jealous and bullying her daughter because of their jealousy. 

i will refer to the mother as lorrie and the daughter as katy so the rest of this is less confusing. 

lorrie has been to the school multiple times and accused my daughter and other students of bullying katy. the assistant principal has pulled my daughter out of class to discuss katy. i'm not sure if lorrie had anything to do with the cps report but i can not contact her directly. lorrie refused to communicate with me when the girls first stopped being friends. i tried to contact her several times and she does not answer my calls and has been outwardly hostile to my daughter on more than one occasion.

katy is a bully who says hurtful and dark natured stuff to try and appear ""edgy"" to her friends. my daughter has told me some pretty horrific stuff that katy said and i advised my daughter to stay cautious throughout their friendship. when the friendship fell apart, katy began to say pretty cruel things about my daughter, my son, and our home. my daughter would tell me about the worst of it. 

one of the things katy said about my 8 year old son was disgusting and completely out of line so my husband and i remembered it pretty vividly. my daughter told us about the comment about 3 or 4 months ago. 

a few days ago, cps knocked on our door while i was at work and told my husband that someone made a report to them about my son and the complaint was exactly what katy was saying about him at school a few months ago. there is no one else who could have made this complaint. it was very specific and had no affiliation with anything based in reality. my husband said the cps employee was very nice and they seemed like they knew that the report was ridiculous. i wasn't there so i don't know what the tone of the conversation was like. 

the problem is i have no proof. the assistant principal at my daughter and katy's high school is planning to interview some of the students that were around katy when she made these comments about my son so i might have some backup which is great, but it's still just hearsay and there is no tangible evidence like text messages or recordings of her saying these things about my son. 

what should i do? is there anything i can do? do i even have a leg to stand on? all i have is my word, my daughter's word and the possible words of a few 15 year old kids. 

any advice is welcome. i'm terrified.

i am in va.

edit: i'm not looking to sue anyone or anything. i just want to clear all of this up and i want katy to be held accountable for making a false report. the things she reported could potentially hurt my son's reputation and damage his future. the allegations were not about me or my husband being neglectful or abusive. they were accusing my son of doing horrible things that he did not and would never do.",2
"ex girlfriend says she will never stop suing. my boyfriend left his ex-girlfriend almost 2 years ago. they were together for about 5 years with no children together.  they had just purchased a home together in the u.s. and have been going to court for a year and a half over it.  he paid for almost everything,  so the court  said they must sell the house and awarded him a much higher percentage of the proceeds. she appealed on the grounds that the judge was unfair to her as a single mother (she had a 24 year old son)  and although we are still waiting to hear back,  it sounds like the court will probably stand by their original decision.  all this really did was prolong this ordeal. 
she emailed my boyfriend a few days ago and basically told him that because she can't keep the  house, she is going to sue him for multiple reasons after they finish this round. although i don't think she will win anything, we really can't afford to keep paying a lawyer to represent him for another year or two.  he has already paid over 20k and we just can't do this much longer.   
my question is,  can she just sue him over and over? how do we handle this? his lawyer honestly has not been overly helpful.

"neighbor cut down my tree without my consent. is this legal?. anyone familiar with property law/laws in ne florida? i came home yesterday from work and noticed my giant oak tree was cut down. now i am left with a 6 foot tall stump (5 foot radius) and no shade! my neighbor never contacted me or asked if it would be ok. the trunk of the tree is about 5% on their property. the tree canopy did cross into their property and over their home but i don't think that allows them to cut down the whole tree. from what i have read they have the right to trim back branches over their property but again, not the whole tree. i kind of feel taken advantage of and feel like this should not have happened. not to mention that the value or my home will be decreased as long as that stump is there. i have photos if needed. thoughts?",2
"hello me and my wife just had a pretty horrid run in with the police. need some advice.. so me and my wife were having sexual intercourse when the cops knocked ( this is first time this has ever happend so i assume nothing will go wrong) at the door. i answered the door and  immediately 2 cops entered my house without permission and started questioning me with abuse questions. they separated me and my wife for questioning which i understand completely but in doing so they made her reaction to this much worse. she has anxiety like crazy and it is triggered by mostly any stressful unfamiliar event that happens, they checked her arms for bruises and asked her about her panic attacks and started asking weird questions, basically they are trying to pin me as an abusive asshole. as they questions my wife and me separately  they began to tell me that my story was different from my wife's story (even though after the fact my wife told me that all she said was ""we had consensual sex and i like it rough so that's probably why other people heard""

anyway the cops nearly scarred me mentally by trying to perp me as a rapist for 2 hours straight when im 100% innocent with my wife as proof. my wife thought that our kids were going to be without a father because these morons wouldnt listen to our stoires. he wanted to arrest me, he wanted there to be a problem when there want one. what should i do?",2
"ma there's a dentist that is breaking hipaa on google/yelp reviews defending themselves slandering patients and giving out all the patients health information, who can i report this to?. in massachusetts. i'm a nurse for the record. my friend came to me and was concerned about a response her dentist wrote back to her on yelp that was public. she was basically saying that she wasn't happy with her dentist and that he didn't have good bedside mannerisms and that she felt he misdiagnosed her (almost costing her thousands out of pocket) she got a second and third opinion who agreed she didn't need the treatment he suggested. he was furious and blew up at her on the response and gave her whole diagnosis, work up, what he found in her mouth, the ""state it was in"" ect. it really made her feel terrible about herself. she asked me if it was a hipaa violation and i said it had to be, right? he's sharing his patients information all over the internet and calling her names. who can we report this to? it's been up for for a month and he's doing it to over a dozen other patients it looks like and yelp and google has refused to take them down.

"i was fired for not coming into work with 5.5 hours notice sent at 3:30 am.. this happened in san antonio, texas.

so at 3:30 am today, my boss texted me to come into work at 9 am. i was asleep and didn't check my phone until 3:30 pm. i responded by saying i was asleep when i got his text and if i had been awake, 5.5 hours is not enough time to sleep before a day of work(8.5 hour shift). i also asked him to please start giving me 24 hours of notice before work (he never posted a schedule, only texted me at most two days before he needed me to come in, though often less than a day's notice). i was never once 'on-call'.

i was a part-time, w-2 employee (i think, because tax deductions are on my paychecks, though i was never given a w-4), though i always drew my paychecks from the folder labeled 'contract labor'. i was employed from 7/30 until 11/11 (today).

as i understand it, the fair labor standards act says employers need to give at least 24 hours notice before work, but i am in an at-will employment state and nothing i can find online tells me whether or not this federal act applies here. is there grounds to sue for this?

"i (23f) genuinely think that there's someone living in my attic.. i'm not sure this is the right place to post but it made the most sense to me. i have reasonable suspicion that someone is squatting in my attic or accessing it on a regular basis. 

to note. the house hadn't been lived in for about 4 months prior. and is in an okay area of cleveland, oh. 

i've been moved in for about a month and a half - i've heard whats sounded like footsteps at first more than a handful of times but then i've just chucked it up to being new house sounds. i'll be honest and say i've been too scared to see if anything's up there since i've moved in so i've never even seen the attic. today my sister and her boyfriend were staying over for the holidays so i asked him to check it out. he popped up with a flashlight and there's a tent set up. he came down and told me. my sister and i came outside and he locked the back door and came out the front. the back door is directly in front of where the attic opens. we called the cops and waited about ten minutes. once the cops arrived the back door was unlocked and no one was in the tent. cops didn't do anything and didn't even go up to check. they were neato. so i put my head up to check while they were there. it's a tent. there's playing cards. they took my name and left. 

sooo i nailed the attic shut and blocked all entries to my home. i was thinking first thing i should do is get new locks and window monitors in the morning. 

other than that - do i hire someone to check the house? do i call the cops again another day?  
should i not stay here alone?

"guy tried to pass me and hit oncoming traffic. said he'd sue me since i didn't slow down (ga). edit: finally know everything that has occurred legally. my stepdad has some friends and found out what was reported. after the officer told me i could leave, the drivers of both cars were taken to the hospital and the officer eventually met up with the guy overtaking me once he was stable. guy told him i sped up and that i was ""mad he was passing me."" said officer went back and looked up my license number (whoever said they normally get numbers for everyone was right. i didn't even think he actually got it) and saw that i already had a speeding citation (from a year ago) and considered it reasonable enough to give me the leaving scene of an accident citation. so. the officer stated his reasoning was the discovery of new evidence i.e. my old ticket. 

my parents are furious and we're just waiting for my day in court because there's no evidence i sped up, there's no dash cam footage that's mysteriously came up, there's nothing besides the guy making an illegal pass saying it was my fault. 



hello! 17 year old here with okay driving history (i have a speeding ticket but i did my time for it). i was on the way to school a few weeks ago and was driving pretty much at the speed limit because it's been rainy for a few weeks and i'm also just still paranoid since my first ticket. two lane road, solid yellow lines. 

cue a-hole tailing me and eventually crossing over to pass. i guess he didn't look good enough because he ended up going headfirst into a car in the opposite lane. i swerved out into the grass and my car was fine but the other two were pretty messed up. the first police on scene did ticket him for crossing the solid yellow but the driver was pretty much unconscious anyway. 

i moved on from it since i didn't cause the accident and i went on to school. yesterday, my stepdad got some papers (my car is registered in his name) from the juvenile court for my county saying i was being faulted for an accident and that this guy's insurance was coming after me. i was so confused because my car wasn't damaged, i don't need this on my driving record, and so on. my stepdad went through the papers and it seems like the original driver is trying to say it was my fault he hit someone because i was supposed to slow down when i saw him passing. 

i have absolutely no idea what to do here. is this a situation where i can tell him to pound sand or should i take it seriously? 

edit: my stepdad called juvie court today and asked what i was charged with and he was told that the officer on scene i spoke to (i told him exactly what happened - guy passed me and hit someone. he asked to see my license. i didn't see why not. he basically said ""thanks for reporting i'll contact you if i need anything else have a good day"") is citing me for leaving the scene of an accident. and the reason he let me go then was because he ""didn't know i could've prevented the accident until further investigation.""

we're even more confused and my parents went to the insurance people today and they said no one has contacted them but they made copies of all the paperwork and that we'd all just have to wait. i'm guessing other driver got my license plate number and told him i sped up or something. i don't know what to do here because if this sticks, i lose my license until i turn 21 (stipulation of my first ticket).

"an airbnb i recently stayed at had hidden cameras in the bedrooms, my friends and i were recorded having sex. anything i can do to have the footage deleted?. some friends and i met up in southern california to have a little weekend together since we all live in different parts of the country. i brought my girlfriend with me and so did a few of my friends. the weekend went how it went and on our last day there we noticed there were small hidden cameras speckled through the home. after checking the bedrooms we confirmed there were in fact 2-3 cameras in each room all pointed towards the beds. i contacted the hosts and they stated that its their home and legally they can have security cameras in the home. is there anything we can do to have the footage deleted or something? i understand the need for security cameras in case of damages or stolen items, but being pointed at the bed in all the rooms? it makes me feel really uneasy.

"update sister took $250k from mother with dementia. original post is nearly a year old.

mother passed away, and within a week older sister & caretaker of mom for 2 years had gotten our mother with dementia to sign over $250k, bought a house, put it in her name, and had about $20k left over that she kept, and hid it from me for a year.  she realized i had a good idea of the value of our mother's estate and admitted it to me.

i tried to work with her, and get her to pay out the other siblings what their fair share of the $250k would have been to them/us, she refused and cut off communication.

i filed a police report for financial elder abuse, the detective just emailed me, he subpoena'd medical & financial records, and is having sister come in for an interview in the next week.

i hope it gets resolved.  please forgive me, since this is an active case, i don't want to disclose the location.",2
"norway my classmate ordered custom sweaters for our class. the sweaters never came, and she got the money back over a year ago. me and my other classmates never got our money back from her, she has it all. how do i get her to give my/our money back?. over three years ago (january 2014) we ordered custom sweaters for our class. my classmate, let's call her frida, received money from us and then placed the order. we were around 65 people ordering, and it costed around $25 per sweater, so she got around $1625

long story short, the distributor scammed us and we didn't get the sweaters. frida was clearly annoyed with us asking about updates, and stopped replying completely to anything related to it. in august 2017 she announced that she had gotten all the money back a while ago, and that we could send her our account numbers and she'd send out the money asap. everyone were relieved and happy. after a few weeks, no one had gotten their money back from her and asked what was going on. one person said she got her money (frida's best friend), but none of the others as i know of. now it's over a year ago and no one's heard anything still, she hasn't posted or replied after she made the original post saying she got the money.

i sent her a pm the other day asking for an update. i said it's fine if she needs more time to do it for whatever reason, that i'm sure everyone's understanding, but that people just want a reply. that the silence is the frustrating part. she has completely ignored it.

what can i do to get my/our money back? i thought about telling her i'll report her for fraud if she doesn't reply or give my money back within two weeks. the report will most likely not result in anything, but maybe it'd push her to repay everyone?

&#x200b;

**edit since i cant reply to people**: thank you all for your advice, it's been really helpful. and you're right, the distributor didn't technically scam us since he did repay us after two years (or earlier if frida had them a while). i do know there was an attempt to get the sweaters since she wasn't the only one working on getting our money back and talking to the distributor, and also because we got pictures of the sweaters at one point.

i'm not going to talk to the folk high school since the nature of the school is that you take one year there basically studying a hobby you have. norwegians often call it a free-year to relax before going to uni, and figuring out what you want to do with your life. since we left that school three years ago i don't think they'd appreciate getting involved. if it was a uni or highschool i would, though.

we are all spread across the country now, but i'll message everyone involved and ask them if they want to take legal action against her, at the same time as i message frida letting her know that if she keeps ignoring us it'll have consequences. hopefully she'll be scared into just repaying us, and if not then i'll follow your legal advice on what to do next. i won't let it go even if she gives me my money back but no one else.

i'm also gonna pop her then-boyfriend a message and ask him what he knows, as he's one of my best friends and might have some intel. ",2
"(update) the exceptionally stupid ending to the cat scam saga-cat now has a no contact order. you all thought it over.  so did i.  but no!  turns out this story really could get weirder

recap- years ago i took in an injured stray cat.  the cat was did not have a collar or chip.  a good faith attempt was made to locate possible owners. after owning the cat for several years i began receiving messages on social media from someone claiming to be the original owner.  they demanded i return the cat and i refused and blocked them.  eventually they escalated to sending letters to my home on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office.  the letters demanded i pay hundreds for the privilege of keeping the cat or they would sue (for what exactly was unspecified.)  at this point it was clear this was a scam, albeit a bizarre one.

someone on the bola thread suggested reporting the letters to the local bar association. i ignored the first two but when they kept arriving i went ahead and did so.  i assume the bar association took some kind of action because the next letter i received was basically the scammer raging 'how dare you'.  this was the first letter that contained an actual threat against my safety.

so, to cut this already way too long story short, i filed a police report.  after some additional letters my cat now has a no contact order.  okay, okay, it's in my name, but we all know it's really for the cat.  

i will say the threats were of the more creative, less actionable sort, but i'm hopeful this will truly put an end to it.  this is honestly the single dumbest thing i've ever gone through.

my cat continues not to care.

"dog died while under sitter's care - story does not add up (los angeles, ca, usa). my fiance and i were out of town for vacation and left our two dogs with a sitter who runs her daycare out of her home (los angeles, ca). we dropped the dogs off on tuesday. the sitter informed us she was going out of town on wednesday but had an alternate sitter lined up who would be staying in her house to cover things from wednesday until her return on saturday. she also tells me about the vet tech who lives in the front of her duplex who she sometimes uses for ""emergencies"". 

today (saturday) i get a frantic voicemail from the sitter stating that my dog had a seizure and wasn't going to make it. i call the vet and they confirm that he was brought in this morning experiencing convulsions, went into cardiac arrest and they could not resuscitate him. he was a perfectly healthy 5/yo dog with no issues whatsoever when i left him. 

i drive home, frantic, and arrive at the vet to say goodbye to my dog, and am told by the vet tech about the ""bite marks"" he was treated for elsewhere and was brought in with - which i immediately explain i know nothing about. they bring out my dog's body, which has a huge bite mark with approximately two dozen stitches on his spine right at the neck/hackles level. i immediately begin calling the original sitter and alternate sitter to find out wtf is going on. 

original sitter finally caves and explains that he was ""attacked at the dog park"" by a ""pit-type dog"" and she did not get the other dog owners info. says that she didn't tell me because she ""didn't want to ruin my vacation and it was no big deal"". i ask the alternate sitter if the original sitter told her to lie to me and her answer was a ""no....yes... kind of"" and then she proceeds to tell me that original sitter didn't want to ""ruin my trip"" and so asked she and her boyfriend not to tell me, and they felt conflicted but ultimately followed her wishes. 

i wait for original sitter to get back to town. while outside i confront the vet tech who lives in the front of the duplex asking if he knew anything of what happened to my dog, which he denied. while waiting for original sitter to show up fiance overhears the vet tech make a phone call saying ""original sitter told people we've been working together and i don't normally do this kind of stuff but i could lose my job"" - moments later a woman pulls up to his house, enters, carries out a pink duvet from his home, and puts it in her trunk and drives away. 

original sitter gets home and when questioned about a vet receipt for the stitches, gives me a photo taken of a printed receipt that shows services were rendered for the 29th - a day after she was already out of town - and that the credit card charge was entered manually. she cannot provide a physical copy of the receipt and the medications she says they provided my dog (i have the bottles) do not match the medications on the photo of the receipt she gave me. 

she tries to say it must have been a ""brain disease"" and that the dog bite had nothing to do with it... but the vet i spoke with who treated my dog for the seizures said that a) a healthy five year old dog should have survived a seizure so likely it was a bacterial infection that caused it, potentially from the bite; b) my dog should have been held for 24 hour observation after the bite/anesthesia/stitches

it seems to my like the original sitter's story is not adding up and i'm wondering if she didn't have her vet tech friend perform some sort of illegal, back yard surgery to stitch up my dog and then have someone forge the receipt. what can i legally do here to get to the bottom of this situation, and what sort of case do i have against her? i don't even care about the money because it won't bring my dog back, but i want to make sure she is never allowed to do this to someone else.",2
"ended up in the er after an accident at work, my boss is lying to me to me and playing stupid. turns out she does not have wc and may not even have a business license.. i work a landscaping design job in florida. we're paid with a handwritten check and under-the-table. i got a long splinter under my fingernail all the way to the end of the nail bed while pulling weeds on the job. it was only my 5th shift (although second week) working there. i ended up having to go to the er to get it surgically removed, lots of fun getting multiple shots in my finger.

after searching a few state databases, the only business license she has under her name is one for real estate, and no record of workers comp coverage. looking back on it, i think the hospital staff discovered this as well but were going to let me figure that out. 


is there anything i can do about this, or am i just stuck with the bill?",2
"ia my father left my 3y/o daughter about $500k in a trust, ex-husband (who lives in mn) wants to use the trust funds for living expenses. my father left my daughter, who is 3, about $500k in a trust. the trustee is not a family member, but a professional trustee. my daughter is supposed to begin receiving the money at 25, but they explained that they have the power to dispense money early for the right circumstances, like a private school or medical bills - or, as they very loosely and briefly mentioned, basic living costs in an emergency hardship situation. they gave an example that if i were to become ill and unable to work, the trust could provide some level of assistance to ensure my daughter does has food on her plate and a roof over her head. however this was glossed over pretty quickly and i don't know the technical details.

about two months ago my ex husband quit his job because he said they are unwilling to be flexible with him for his debilitating migraines (his employer told me that he claims to have migraines but has never actually seen a doctor about them for treatment), and says he has been unable to find a new job and intends to instead pursue getting on disability, but expects that to take 2-3 years. he says that he will soon lose his apartment. he is unable to receive most government-based assistance because he scammed the system last year (lied about income to receive food assistance for which he was not qualified and got caught).

so, he has now approached the trustee and wants to use the trust money to pay for an apartment, utilities and a car until he is approved for disability. i was especially surprised about the car portion - he says he needs money to purchase a safer vehicle because his vehicle is old, rated poorly for crashes and does not have working seatbelts (which is a surprise to me - just a few weeks ago i buckled her into the back seat when he picked her up, so not sure what exactly he is claiming there).

i disagree with this use of the funds, particularly because he only has her for 6 days per month. i understood the ability to use the trust for living expenses should be limited to scenarios in which she is genuinely in danger of being homeless or neglected, and that is not the case as i provide everything she needs now and can do so all the time if he is unable to. my father intended the money to provide her with opportunities once she is old enough to use it wisely, not to facilitate my husband's visitation in our custody agreement.

since my ex husband has a history of committing fraud when receiving government assistance and also a history of faking illness (he lied to a previous employer to receive paid time off work claiming he was being treated for cancer when he was not), i do not trust that his intentions here are genuine. i suspect he sees the trust as a way that he can get free money so that he doesn't have to get another job.

anyhow, my question: since the trust is for the benefit of my daughter and she is obviously a minor, what can i do to ensure it is protected? should i assume that the trustee has her interests in mind and will not prematurely release money for something like this, or does it sound like there is real danger that he will drain the trust? is it possible for me to hire a lawyer to argue that the money should be saved for her later in life unless the circumstances are truly dire? i'm not sure if i can actually hire a lawyer and get them involved because i am not the trustee, the company is.

"my neighbor wants me to sell my house to his friend at much less than market value. he has threatened to ""scare away"" anyone else i show the house to.. i'm moving soon and need to sell my house. when my neighbor found out about this he had one of his friends take a look at it and he made me an offer far below what i would expect to get.

after i turned it down he became agitated. since then he's been making thinly veiled threats about how he'll approach anyone else who sees the house and ""tell them all about the house in the interest of full disclosure"". he stressed the word ""all"" which leads me to believe he'll make up some pretty grandiose stories.

i can only conclude that he's expecting to get a cut from getting his friend the house at an extremely low price. are there any laws against this? do i have any legal recourse if he follows through with his threats?

after the initial letter from the law firm saying they can represent us, we started getting phone calls from other firms, saying they'd been alerted to the lis pendens and could also represent us.  we were not super happy with this and asked how they got our cell number.  they said they subscribe to a service that alerts them when things like liens, foreclosures etc. are filed on a property. we hung up.
 

we looked at all our documents from the closing and confirmed that we do indeed have homeowner's title insurance (yay!).  our deed is a ""bargain and sale"" deed, for those wondering. we also pulled all deed/mortgages and other documents for our property going back to 1972 online.  the last action was when we bought our house – no documents have been filed since.  i signed up on acris to be alerted to any changes made to the property documents (thank you for the redditor who suggested that).  i also emailed the da for my county, and their economic crimes bureau head emailed me back to ask for my cell number to follow up with me.  i gave it to him, but he hasn't called yet, so maybe that will be in the next (and hopefully final) update.

 
my husband met with our lawyer this morning, and i asked him to speak about all the things that you all suggested in the last post. prior to the meeting, our lawyer had reached out to the firm who filed the lis pendens, and actually got a copy of the court transcript where the con man said he owns our property.  according to the transcript, he claims he bought it in 2016.  our lawyer called their law firm and basically said ""where is the deed?""  they supposedly hemmed and hawed about it, so we're starting to think they don't have it, and never did!  they may just be going off the words of a sleezeball who's like ""yeah, i totally own that place.  i even have a deed for it.  no, you can't see it.""  it's possible that based off this alone, they filed against our property. 
 

in addition, it's not like this guy is saying he bought our house last week and the paperwork just hasn't been filed yet, he claims he bought it 3 years ago and there is still no paperwork filed to attest to this fact. (i was able to pull up all records for our home going back nearly 50 years, in about 15 minutes online).  our lawyer does not like the way this other firm is handling this, and basically said to them ""you have no grounds for this.  take it off.""
 

the attorney handling this case at that law firm is out of the office today and tomorrow,  but will be calling our lawyer back on friday.  i am hopeful that it will just be a matter of ""take the lis pendens off."" and ""ok"".  i'll update again after the call between the lawyers. i told my husband the number 1 question is ""where. is. the. deed?""  when we initially spoke with them, they clearly said they had it in hand, which is part of the reason i was freaking out. i honestly just want to be done with this, so getting back at the suing law firm for gross negligence (or whatever term fits the issue) is of no interest to me at the moment.  if they give us a hard time about removing the lis pendens, then we'll see.
 

so far my takeaway from this that i would share with anyone going through something similar is that law firms are made up of people.  and just like people can be good and smart and kind (like all of you!) they can also be dumb, shifty and lazy, and not bother to do their due diligence even though that's like 50% of why they exist in the first place (but i'm not bitter……).
 

thank you all so much for your help,  i'll update again as things progress and hopefully conclude.",2
"update: neighbors kid fell of trampoline into our yard (ny). original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wyn3f/ny\_neighbors\_kid\_fell\_off\_their\_trampoline\_into/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wyn3f/ny_neighbors_kid_fell_off_their_trampoline_into/)

thank you to everyone who shared their advice.  i contacted my hoi and the representative laughed at the fact that we were getting sued.  long story short she said not to worry and they would handle it.  i contacted a few lawyers in my family and they said the neighbors have no bounds to sue since trampolines are apparently illegal in my town.

turns out the neighbors do not own the house and that they rent it, the owner and landlord of that house was miffed since he is the one that will have to pay the fines for the trampoline.  turns out that the renters don't have renters insurance (which is why they asked for a cash payment from me). last i heard was that the landlord gave them a 30 day notice.  as for me?  i'm buying exterior cameras so this doesn't happen anymore.",2
"my truck was stolen and later found but the police did not notify me until 6 weeks later, at which point the tow yard had already sold it at auction. wa state. my truck ('87 beater, not worth much but very important to me as a spent a lot of time fixing it up) was stolen in mid october. i immediately filed a police report and checked back in several times with the police for updates, but was told if any tow yard received it the police would know and would notify me. 

fast forward to last friday, i receive a call from the police saying my truck was recovered... on november 1! six weeks prior! from my conversation with the very apologetic dispatcher, it seems like they messed up and forgot to notify when it was found, but never admitted to that explicitly.

i called the lot it was sent to, and was informed that per their policy the vehicle was held for 29 days and then sold at auction. a later phone called revealed it was sold on nov 24, after only 23 days, which i would think is illegal. apparently the towing company sends a letter to your address, but i had just moved out of my old place not 2 weeks prior to the theft and heard nothing. i had no idea it had even been recovered!

all i really want is my truck back, which i don't think will happen, but all of this just seems wrong to me. am i entitled to compensation? and from whom? the towing company sold it before it's stated 29-day policy, but the police made no effort to contact me. do i have legal recourse here?

i have tried to speak with police but cannot get in touch with their ""complaint hotline"" until tomorrow. same situation with the towing company.
any advice greatly appreciated.",2
"banned from public unuversity due to false allegations without hearing my side. banned lifted three weeks after person reda ted all charges and admitted to lying. usa, washington. edit: title should say ""redacted"". sorry for the spelling errors. i didn't spell check before posting.

edit2: it was a female. it is a title ix investigation
i did speak to a lawyer for 30 minutes who said i didn't have much to fight for. the ""online"" courses were not online. it meant my normal classes that were lecture based could provide me info vis email. it wasn't a set up online course and 4 of my 5 professors didn't have any way to provide online lecture info. and even so, only one class provided me resources. the dean did not provide any info even after emails from me asking for it.

i was banned from campus following allegations against me. i was accused of sexual misconduct and assault charges. the allegations not only never happened but i have never even met this person for longer than 5 minutes at a party.

i was brought into the dean's office with officers in the room who showed me the charges. i told them i had no idea what they were coming from and i barely know this person. they still issued a no trespassing issue until ""further investigation"".

i was not given any chance to take classes or reach out to any professors. i am a senior and about to graduate. they reached out to me with an option to take classes online for classes with lecture only curriculum. they only gave me info for one class. then a week later they lifted my no contact ban based on new info. and another week later they entirely lifted my ban due to the person saying they completely lied and the allegations we're not true. despite this i am still ""under investigation"".

i missed too much class to reasonably still complete. three full weeks of missed senior level classes. i had to drop out due to this condition.

i was also let go at my prestigious internship because they only hire full time students. 

because of this i have no school and no job.

the university refused any refund to me upon request and their response was ""the actions were necessary due to the severity of the accusation"" despite never hearing my side.

do i have any rights whatsoever??? i'm out a job. thousands of dollars and school.",2
"won $2000 scholarship from a gaming tournament while i was in high school. they said i had to wait until college to receive the money. the organization is shutting down. can i do anything to still receive my money?. **location:** i live in rockville, maryland, and the organization is based in rowland heights, california (i believe)

basically, i won this high school gaming tournament where the winners were promised $2000 college scholarship money. the other winners (my teammates) started college in previous years and have already received their money.

i only started college this year, but after contacting them about the money they have almost completely ignored me. they gave me vague answers about how they'll get this sorted out ""by the end of the school year"" (wtf?). i suspect that the organization has run out of money and is shutting down. their website is no longer up, and they are no longer running their yearly high school tournament.

there was no written contract, but the money was promised. they also made a facebook post after the tournament saying ""congratulations to this team (mine) for winning $2000 each in scholarship money!"", and included a photo.

thanks in advance! this is a massive amount of money for me (broke college student) so any advice is greatly appreciated!

edit: to make it clear, this is a small organization, not a big company

edit: i have been contacted by the organizers and they claim they are working on it right now... i think i will still pursue action, especially if they don't give me a definite response on when i can receive my money.

edit2: they told me """"within one month"""" to ""verify"" my identity as a student. i have already provided the information, i'm thinking that if they're not ready to send the check within a few days then i will get legal involved.

"pharmacy gave my controlled substance prescription to someone else. refuses to admit they were in the wrong, refuses to refill my prescription, refuses to tell my doctor they screwed up, and is telling me they cannot help me until they do a month long investigation.. i take a medication which is considered a controlled substance, if i don't have my medication i struggle to function properly. i go to a common pharmacy chain in ontario, canada. 

last monday i went to collect my refill of my medication, they weren't able to fully fill the full balance so instead provided me with a weeks worth of my medication, and told me to collect the balance on the following day.

on wednesday evening i went in to collect my balance, only for the pharmacy technician to tell me she could not find my prescription. after taking my information she told me that i had already collected my remaining balance tuesday afternoon. i denied me ever doing this, and was told she could not help me and i would need to come in thursday morning to talk to head pharmacist to explain the situation.

thursday morning i went and talked to the head pharmacist who:

* insisted that i already collected my remaining balance. which i denied repeatedly.
* i told her to confirm via their security cameras that it was not me collecting the medication, which she did. 
* now repeatedly insisted that i allowed someone else to collect my remaining balance. i told her i have no one allowed to do that on my file, except my parents. who neither of them is alive anymore. 
* unfortunately she told me she could not help me further, and i need to report my medication as stolen. which i refused to do, because i never received my balance, and i felt that would be me admitting fault on my part.
* i called my doctor and explained my situation, and he immediately called the pharmacy. the head pharmacy tech told him that they dispensed my prescription to me. he told me unfortunately he cannot re-issue me my prescription, unless the pharmacy admits wrong doing. 
* the head pharmacist basically told me she could do nothing for me, and asked me to leave or security would be called.

i went home and called the corporate number of the pharmacy, and explained everything to them. they agreed to open an investigation however told me this could take well over a month to get a result, they gave me a case number, and recommended that i make alternative arrangements with my doctor. 

on friday i called my doctor again, and explained everything one more time, he was sympathetic however he told me he cannot re-issue my prescription unless the pharmacy admits they screwed up because it is a controlled substance. 

can anyone help me? or tell me what the hell i should be doing here?",2
"update: my bil stole my kittens and sold them. police aren't helpful and new owner is not budging. do i have any recourse? (pa). i got a lot of good advice so i just wanted to thank everyone and let you know what happened.  i went back to the station and managed to talk to a police officer who was actually interested in doing his job. i showed him the texts, the conversations with the coworker, and copies of the vet bills. he went to have a chat with this coworker, and she voluntarily gave the kittens up. my cats are home safe! she did deny that she paid for them when talking to the officer, but i don't know what to believe. 

someone did suggest on my post that i go through my belongings to see if my bil had stolen anything else. it turns out some stuff was missing, though nothing too precious because we didn't notice it missing right away. still, i believe we will be pursuing this with the police as well.  ",2
"(update) cease and desist letter after posting a review on yt and tricked by developer for address/name. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z5mms/i_do_reviews_i_reveiced_a_cease_and_desist_after/?utm_source=reddit-android

so it's been an interesting two months, after my post i started contacting a few attorneys locally and eventually had to call the state bar for a referral because of the type of possible laws not a lot of people handle that like a normal lawyer does that's usually family/criminal.

i finally found an attorney that understood what i was talking about and wanted a link to the reddit post and agreed with the majority of the top advice i received. 

he accepted a small retainer of $250 to respond to the cease and desist i received and a few possible future letters/calls.

he responded asking them exactly what statements i made that were false and requested exact times in the video that the statements were made. since i previously privated the video we had to give them a different link. 

he also outlined what will happen should they continue stating that during discovery he will be requesting all communication between qa, play testing, developers, and management to see if they were aware of any of these bugs/issues that may compromise a customer's experience while playing etc.

it also included a paragraph basically calling them out for reaching out to me and lying about ""swag and wanting feedback"" to get my information to send a cease and desist instead of going through the proper legal channels to obtain this and the fact that i still have yet to receive any ""swag"" that this is clearly the case.

also included that they need to preserve all the emails they sent to other reviewers because it's of interest in the possible upcoming legal action. he also requested they preserve all sorts or other communication between qa, developers etc.

so after he had confirmed receipt of the letter we waited and waited. nothing for about a month but then i received 3 large boxes containing games, posters, statues, a custom ps4 limited edition console, bobble heads, funko pops, just every piece of swag i think they have for 3-4 of their games and a letter saying ""sorry it took so long for us to get this swag out to you!""

my attorney then sent out another letter asking about the status and their position on the cease and desist and we received a letter back with only a few sentences basically saying they made a mistake and we can expect no further correspondence on the matter and that the video can be reinstated if we so wish. 

he sent out another asking about the lost ad revenue due to me having to private the video since they admitted it was a mistake. they sent out a check for $500 and some papers i needed to sign basically saying the issue is over and i won't sue them.

thank you la, i didn't get sued and after it all i came out ahead. i'm still not going to link my channel or the video or name the company in question but thanks for all your help!",2
"rear ended by a cop who pressured me not to report it ma. this is happening right now. i work at a dog daycare and was driving a group of pups back from the dog park, going the speed limit, when a car bumped into me. turns out it was an unmarked police vehicle. since i'm at work, i asked if i could just photograph his insurance information and file a claim later. he said that since he's police i would need to stay and wait to file an accident report. 

he kept emphasizing that this would be a long process, that the damage wasn't that severe, and that i should let it go. he also tried to accuse me of speeding, which i wasn't—this happened maybe 50 yards past a crosswalk at which i had stopped, so i don't even think it's possible for me to have been speeding unless i had floored it. it made me uncomfortable that he was so adamant about me not filing a report, like maybe this isn't his first accident, so i went ahead with filing it.

what should i expect to happen next? is it true that he wasn't able to just give me his insurance so i could have moved on with my day? can he make this out to be my fault somehow? am i owed any compensation from him personally or from the police department for the rest of my shift i'm likely going to miss?",2
"update they removed all the cats from my mom's house.. animal control and the police were called, and it took them until today to get here. over the weekend i took my mother to a hotel, and she said she was happy that i cleaned up for some mother-daughter time. she also thanked me for getting her a new bed. she couldn't comprehend that we weren't in her house. 

 animal control, with a lot of help confiscated all the cats except two, and all of the birds. for those debating it, no it was not a swan, but a young duck. i should probably have known, but i wasn't going to take a second peek into that room. the total cat count was 213, and the total bird count was 87. there were a significant amount more that were, unfortunately, dead. many of the cats were sick, and may have to be euthanized.

my mother is extremely upset, she has been admitted to the hospital for reasons i would rather not get into. i don't know if the house is saveable, the situation is still being assessed. i'm sorry it's not a happy update, but at least i'm no longer drowning in cats.",2
"a mega church next to my home plays music at high volume. i live in lawrenceville, ga and there's a mega church next to my neighborhood that plays music at volumes distinctly audible at over 400'. my wife and i have tried to speak with them to no avail and there is a paper trail of police action going back at least 4 months.

the gwinnett county statutes say that anything able to be heard by a person of reasonable hearing (i have a massive amount of hearing damage from my time overseas) over 50' is illegal unless it's construction which is 300'.

do i need to go ahead and continue to gather evidence of the hours and volume then retain a civil attorney? is this something i can take before the judge myself since even the police here have said they are flagrantly disregarding the law but can only ask them to turn it down?",2
"my sister abandoned our autistic brother with me. now 6 months later finally admitted that she won't be resuming custody, and has told me he is now ""my problem"" as she won't be coming back to canada. is this legal..?. i am in **ontario, canada** while my sister was in vancouver bc.

my brother is on the spectrum, and he is someone who basically needs constant and around the clock care. he is in his 20's now, but mentally he is about \~8 years old.

nearly a year ago my mom suddenly passed away due to a blood clot in the brain, it came out of nowhere and shocked our family and my dad passed a few years back from cancer. 3 years ago our mom had a will drawn up, and my older sister basically agreed in the event of something happening she would be responsible for my brother (there were a ton of reasons for this specifically the fact she lived within my brothers support network, while i am far away). in agreement with this my mom put aside a large amount of money for the purpose of my brothers well being.

my sister and her fiancee took my brother in for about 6 months, but it became very apparent that she misunderstood the amount of work required for his care. she asked if i would be willing to take him for a month or so while she went and took time off. i agreed simply because of the fact i am now a stay at home mom, but told her i couldn't do this for long.

one month turned into two, and then finally 4. she kept making excuse after excuse, but she finally agreed that she would take him when they got back from a vacation in europe to visit her fiancee's family. when she got back she would let me know. then basically nothing, absolutely fucking nothing for two months. never responded to any of my emails, messages or phone calls.

finally yesterday i received a long facebook message from her telling me:

* she isn't coming back to canada, as she has decided to get married in europe and live there with her fiancee.
* she isn't coming back for my brother, and said i needed to take care of him as he is now ""my problem"".
* she said she was sorry but she couldn't deal with him anymore.

she has blocked me on facebook, and her cell phone number no longer seems to work anymore.

i know this sounds cold, but i can't do this. i can't take care of my brother anymore. on top of this all the money that my parents put aside for my brother, aside from a bit she sent me early on i have no idea where that money is or where it went.

i have tried a variety of services, and explained my situation about my brother, but i have discovered there is basically fuck all help for me. i was told it could take several years to find a place for him in a care facility, and it is just wait list after wait list.

so like my question is, can my sister really just abandon him like this? isn't there some sort of law against basically abandoning someone your responsible for? i know he isn't a child anymore, but mentally he is.

to clarify a few things, i love my brother, but he is far too much for me to handle and my toddler. we have been struggling to make ends meet financially, with the increased upkeep cost. to the point where i worry for our future. i can't leave my brother alone, so i working is out of the question.

"purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. now what? ny, putnam county. mostly what's in the title. condo was vacant for roughly 60 days between closing and our attempt to move in. upon getting there with our belongings, we discovered a new deadbolt on the door - the unit was vacant and had no deadbolt when we did our final walkthrough the day before closing. tried knocking on the door. got no answer, reached out to our realtor, who contacted the seller's agent and asked that he get in touch with his client to find out what the hell is going on, but at this point we assumed squatters. about an hour later, a young man showed up and produced a 36 month lease  which had been paid in advance. all $1 of it. he told us it's between us and his uncle, and headed into the apartment.

our realtor is flabbergasted; he's encountered squatters and tenants who had to be evicted after refusing to leave at the end of the lease, but never anything like this. the police won't touch this either, which makes perfect sense given the context - dude has a lease that predates our contract (albeit by one day) so as far as they're concerned it's a civil matter. the condo association is incredibly hands-off about owners leasing their properties (which is part of why this place was appealing, as i plan to rent it out myself when we are ready to buy a house), so they want nothing to do with the situation.

to me it seems like the lease should be completely void given that it was executed in ridiculously bad faith, but i am nowhere near a lawyer. to that end, the attorney who handled the transaction for us is out of town till next week - my understanding is that he's camping or hiking or hunting or something along those lines and is basically incommunicado for the time being, but i am waiting to hear back from his admin to get details (he's a one man firm so there are no associates that can help me in the interim).

i have no idea what to do here. luckily the truck we were using to move is owned by a friend's business, and they have graciously offered to let us store our belongings in it while we get this sorted. unluckily, my wife and i turned in the keys to our old apartment this morning, and as such we have nowhere to go.

i'd be willing to do a cash for keys thing to get this guy out of our apartment but he won't speak to us. beyond that, do i have grounds to evict him? if so, how do i recoup the expenses associated with this whole clusterfuck, sue the seller? does the tenant have any sort of liability here? if i do pull of a successful cash for keys arrangement, can i sue the seller for that as well? what about the friend who is letting us keep all of our stuff in one of his trucks, does he have any grounds to sue or does the fact he is voluntarily letting us use the truck take that out of the equation? is there anything else that i am not thinking of?

i am shaking with anger right now so i apologize for this being a bit of a a rambling novel, and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

edit: location is new york, specifically putnam county.

**update (4:45pm):** i just got a call from my attorney's admin. he's apparently close enough to civilization to have an internet connection in his cabin and should be checking in with her shortly, at which point she'll have him reach out to me. apparently he was a civil litigator before he ""retired"" to real estate law, and she thinks he'll welcome an excuse to step into his old shoes and tear these people apart. needless to say i am looking forward to hearing from him.

**update 2 (5:25pm):** just heard from both my realtor and my attorney. the evening seems to have found a way to get even more interesting, but the truck owning friend is about five minutes out with my car. we're going to meet my realtor for dinner, my closing documents and some badly needed drinks (said the guy who doesn't really drink). i'll update tomorrow morning if not tonight, but till then... thank you thank you thank you for the advice and reassurance. wish me luck!",2
"pretty sure the 16 year old who lives above us is living alone. is this neglect?. single mom and her daughter live above us (in ct). the daughter is a music student and we constantly have to hear her playing guitar or keyboard with an amp, singing (more like screeching) into a microphone, and producing shitty beats with too much base. 

she plays music way louder than she needs to to practice. its louder than our tv much of the time. her mother usually leaves every night before 8 (if she has been home at all that day) and comes home in the morning to (presumably) shower and then go to work. mother might be home 1 or 2 nights per week.

her daughter obviously takes advantage of this and has friends over. they are so loud some nights that they are clearly drunk. other nights she will sing into a microphone until midnight. they wake us up all hours of the night on weekends and weekdays. the mother complains to us that her apartment smells like weed ""all the time"" and blames it on us, since we are below her. preeeeeetty sure it's her own kid, though, because we don't smoke in or around the house.

he did not take the news well when i told him his son in law was probably his son. lots of screaming. lots of blaming me. eventually lots of apologizing to me. i told him i would like to approach this differently as there is the chance he is not the father. i told him to get a dna test done and that i would inform his son in law that his supposed father refuses to meet without a dna test being done first to prove it. he agreed this was a good idea. his thoughts were on his grandkids asking if it would be a good idea to have them tested for any genetic abnormalities. i told him to hold off until this can be done first. 

i told his son in law the news this morning that his possible dad refuses to meet until he gets a dna test proving parentage. 

he agreed without any hesitation. 

so now its a waiting game. the lab i use for this takes 2-3 weeks but is very thorough with their work. the dad is scheduled for a swab tomorrow morning and the son in law is scheduled the next day. i did this on purpose to avoid any chance happenings.

"update: today i came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from. delaware, usa

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d9t0ez/today_i_came_home_to_a_new_fence_in_my_backyard/)

i found the fence on thursday. saturday i was having about a dozen people over for a family birthday party so the eyesore of a fence had to go, one way or another. so on friday morning, i had a follow-up call with the realtor who knew nothing about the fence, and he told me that the homeowner didn't either. i called my neighborhood civil council president to let him know about it, and he told me about encroachment issues (as the fence was on my property), but also let me know that in my city, a permit is not required to build this type of fence.

i took many commenters' advice and installed security cameras around my house, two of which have either full or partial view of the neighboring backyard.

i also took to heart the idea that there may be squatters living or preparing to live in the house next door. if i find anything on my security cameras indicating there may be squatters, i'll be informing the police.

so, on friday afternoon, i removed the fencing in its multiple different pieces and gently leaned them against the brick garage, with the exception of one door-sized section, which i put against the basement door in case there are indeed squatters entering through there. saturday, sunday, and monday came and went without any indication that the yard was entered again, and the fencing over the basement door hasn't moved.

we still don't know who built the fence or why, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares, and at least now i don't have an abomination of a fence to stare at anymore. i will likely build my own fence though, one that looks good and is structurally sound, and that spans my property line.

thanks to everyone for your input and advice, and if i learn who built the fence i will be sure to update again!",2

"update - ontario - people are living in our just built town home claiming they are renting but will leave for only ""$15k"". police are not being helpful, what am i supposed to do here?. i posted this last weekend.  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c0f7ep/ontario\_people\_are\_living\_in\_our\_just\_built\_town/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c0f7ep/ontario_people_are_living_in_our_just_built_town/) 

today they were forcefully removed from the property by the police. our lawyer was somehow able to get a judge to look at everything and approve having them removed. the police officer basically told us to not move in and have the entire house professionally cleaned, as there is a bunch of needles and other things laying around.

on top of all that it seems they tried to seemingly destroy everything in our house. all the new appliances that came with our house are basically ruined, all toilets, and bathtubs seemingly look like they have been smashed with a hammer. in some places it looks like someone tried to rip the fucking wiring out of our walls, etc. basically our house i guess basically as a final fuck you to us.

"my friend's mom only lets him sleep for 4 hours every night. is this child abuse/neglect. my friend (grade 11) says that his mom only lets him sleep 4 hours per day, based on the idea that he needs to study more. even when he has no upcoming assignments or tests, he is only allowed to sleep between 1 am and 5 am. if his grades do poorly, he is allowed to sleep less, since his mom thinks that he must not be studying enough. is there anything he can do about it?

"barber here. i gave a 16 year old girl a haircut. her mom threatened to sue me for $10,000. ma.. this girl came with long hair and she wanted a short hairstyle. she said she couldn't afford a saloon that's why she came here. so i just gave her the haircut that she wanted. she paid and left.

today her mom came and told me that it's a actually assault to cut a minor's hair without parental consent and she's going to sue me for $10,000 for destroying her daughter's beautiful hair. the whole assault thing sounds like bullshit as boys under 18 come in all the time on their own and get haircuts.

do i need to worry about her trying to cause problems for me?

"i purchased a vehicle and was assaulted by the salesmen when i went to pick it up several days later. what type of lawyer should i contact? additional details in post. a bit of a doozy...

i purchased a car saturday in massachusetts. i paid 10k in a bankers check and financed the remainder. upon pickup on tuesday,  i was told i was given a rebate (which was not in any of my paperwork) that i was not entitled to. the dealership told me i need to pay $500 or else i can't have the vehicle. at this point, i already had a contract, the keys to the vehicle, had the vehicle insured, signed over the title to my old vehicle...everything i needed aside from registration. as far as i was concerned it was my property at the time. after a verbal back and forth the salesman got tough and told me to back down or he would f me up etc etc. after threatening me, i told him he couldn't do that. he then rushed me and violently pushed me . at that point, for my own safety, i tackled him and we were separated by all the other employees. during the separation he hit me several more times because i was the only individual restrained by the other employees. the other employees collected my paperwork that was lost in the altercatiin and shredded it. the police were called and i filed a report. i have yet to request the police press charges. i declined to initially because after the altercation they had possession of my $10k, my new car and the title to my old car. i had no paperwork other thank the bankers check made to and cashed by the company, and an autopolocy with associated vin.  police told me they couldn't help with the civil side regarding the cars and money, only the assault. if i requested the charges be pressed i couldn't help but think i would have been out that money and both cars for a long time as the civil thing plays out.  i sustained a potentially broken nose and a medium cut to the knee... and what sucked the most for me...the brand new watch, which my wife gave me little more than 3 weeks ago as a gift on our wedding day...is destroyed. had little luck finding a local attorney that would specialise in some of these types of civil claims",2

"update-i need more help. my ex deleted my ba thesis and it's due in 7 days. i need additional help. based on the advice from my last thread i took my laptop to the geek squad to recover the files. they said i'd have it back by the end of the week. that would leave me with enough time to finish the last section of my thesis paper. 

i got a call yesterday that it would actually take 2 weeks because they had to ship my laptop out for data recovery. tried to explain that was unacceptable but nothing could be done about it. 

i'm not looking for technical advice. i need legal advice that i can use for my college and ex. my advisor said he can't give me an extension, which means i won't graduate next month and very likely could just fail out. is there any legal basis for forcing my school to give me an extension? my paper and all of my qualitative data was deleted. plus my backups were deleted. this whole situation is beyond my control. 

is there any action i can take against my ex?

for the bot: i'm in illinois.

this is my original post(https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b856m5/my_ex_deleted_my_ba_thesis_and_underlying/). basically, my roommates and i had a party on sunday. my ex showed up which is not unusual because we were on good terms and her friends are friends with my roommates. my computer was available for people to play their own playlists. again, nothing unusual. i woke up on monday and discovered all my emails were deleted (which is where i made weekly backups of my thesis). when i checked my hard drive, the folder with my thesis was deleted too. i freaked out, asked reddit for advice and took my computer to the geek squad. 

texted my ex later on monday asking if she deleted my thesis and didn't hear back. her friend called me in tears saying my ex deleted everything and feels incredibly sorry and guilty. she did it because she saw me flirting with someone at the party and got jealous. 

i have a fellowship lined up after graduation that i'm not eligible for if i don't actually graduate. i need an extension until i get my files back. i'm completely completely screwed if i can't turn in my thesis. ",2
"roommate flushed an expensive family heirloom down the toilet.. so i'm a sophomore in college and have been living with a randomly paired roommate who i believe has some form of special needs. if the room is messy he gets into some serious anger fits where he will scream and yell at me about not cleaning up and then proceed to throw all of my stuff around the room. this lasts around 20 minutes and he always apologises profusely and cleans everything up and says it won't happen again. 

just yesterday he had another crazy anger fit and took my watch off my desk and flushed it down the toilet and proceeded to scream hysterically. the watch was quite an expensive rolex passed down from my father from his father so it has a lot of significance within the family. i've tried calling the school and sewage system but i've had no luck yet in retrieving it. 

i have moved rooms and spoken to the ra but they have not really offered any significant advice. i have not spoken to my roommate yet as i am both too angry and scared to approach him. i have not spoken to my father yet as i know it will complete devastate him. 

i honestly have no idea how to approach this and any help would be appreciate it. what's the best course of action here?

edit: thanks for all the support and advice here! i really appreciate everyone who's commented and liked this to help me get the best advice possible. a report has been filed with the police and i've been moved to a different room. still waiting for a response from my roommate. watch has not been found yet, but maintenance said its tough to do this on a sunday (for some reason). 

edit 2: thank you for all the kind responses and all the advice, was not expecting this to blow up like this! by some miracle emergency maintenance found it earlier today in the trap along with some other items of mine that he must have thrown down there which they said clogged the toilet. unfortunately the watch doesn't seem to be working but it should be an easy repair. that being said, i had another altercation with my roommate where he tried breaking into my room. called the college police and it looks like they may have detained him or taken him away somewhere. it's been a hectic day but it looks like the situation is being handled. thank you to everyone ❤️

"update me / ca my teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer.. well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. christ.

yesterday afternoon, after i made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), i called her gynecologist. (i have uterine issues so i got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.) 

she was very understanding, and offered to stay late if i wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. so, i called the police, let them know i was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.

my daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when i explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention. 

the doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the sti tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. though i know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, i'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.

after the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. he sat down with my daughter in our living room, while i hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear i'd hear it.)

the detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in maine i needed to speak to. i made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. he left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. he also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family. 

after he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that i make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. i told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up. 

this morning, i got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. his assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in ca, the custody arrangement is in ca, and it will be amended in ca (since ca is her state of residency), and in ca they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. he also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she had to go visit her father, much less in this situation. 

i have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that i could help her as needed. right now she's mostly been playing world of warcraft and eating junk food, but i feel like at least right now i'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.

i want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. i will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state.",2
"apartment complex installed ""smarthome"" devices in my apartment without my consent, is asking me to sign a lease addendum consenting to personal data collection and agreeing to be financially responsible for maintenance and upkeep of said devices. what are my options? colorado. i got a notice via email a while back that the apartment complex where i live in denver was going to be installing ""smarthome"" devices in my apartment. i didn't respond because i assumed i would have to consent in order for them to do anything.  i was wrong, and they replaced my door lock, thermostat, plugs and switches, water sensor, etc. while i was traveling for work. 

now they want me (and every other tenant) to sign an addendum to our leases saying i requested this and asking that i consent to data collection and that if anything goes wrong with the devices that they put in, i am responsible to pay $250 to fix any damage or maintenance to repair or replace them if i do not notify the building within 5 days of malfunction.

some of the language in the addendum makes me very uneasy.

 `""you have requested that we provide insert name of smartdevice vendor in your unit. we agree to do so and you agree to pay additional rent in the amount of $0.00 per month""`  

i did not request this.

`""information collected by insert name of smartdevice venor (""information""): we have listed information collected by each device we supply, some of which may be considered ""personal information,"" depending on your jurisdiction:""""1. front door lock:- entry activity by time and code used- technical information from device, including, but not limited to, battery level and lock status""`

this language is pretty much the same for thermostat, smartplugs and switches, hub, water sensor and software to use it all.

`""information sharing: anonymized and aggregated information collected by the service may be shared with third parties for energy benchmarking, quality of service determinations, and for research and product development. recipients of this information may include, but are not limited to, equipment manufacturers, consultants, educational institutions, utilities, study sponsors and government agencies""`

additionally, there is language that specifies that the devices are owned by the property and if i lose or damage any of them, i am subject to a $250 fine. 

`""if a device has been damaged or appears to be malfunctioning, you are required to notify us within five (5) days.""`

what are my options? i really like my apartment and don't want to leave, but i also don't want to consent to sharing personal information re: entering/exiting my apartment with anyone, even if it is anonymized and aggregated and certainly don't want to be on the hook financially for malfunctioning products that i did not want or consent to being installed.

"update does a child who didn't see one parent because the other parent stole them despite custody orders in place have to repay that time debt after age 18? oregon. previous post a month ago over here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9g6uwn/does_a_child_who_didnt_see_one_parent_because_the/).

i'm safe, and i'm out.

i organised a place to stay with a coworker. i have new bank accounts and all my paperwork. my dad has some regular sport meetings on saturdays that go for hours so i prepared everything the week before, found where my paperwork was and walked out. i've been approved for a rental and i move there soon.

i contacted two police stations near us beforehand who both understood dad's nature straight away when i told them he'd been telling me i couldn't move out because of a time debt and they told me it wasn't a thing. 

i took copies of all of his paperwork too because while i was getting ready to move i found most of what i knew about my parents separating was a lie. there was never a 50/50 custody agreement and my mother never ran off with me in violation to that. my dad had been held for several domestic violence incidents when i was a child and he was only to see me on special holidays and only under strict supervision. he's never been violent to me, but in the papers he had hidden was evidence of a trust available to me when i'm 21. some of the specific wording is it can go to me as an individual or to my carer if that is required. i think my dad was trying to make himself up as my carer without me knowing. i did not find the letter i read when i was a kid from dad's lawyer but like you all said that was probably fake.

after i moved out my dad did try to contact the police. they came to my coworker's address because they had to, but also let me know that yes my dad was trying to say i couldn't look after myself. his words were that i was ""borderline retarded and being abused"".

i've been back to canada to visit my aunts and uncle, and found the aunt who was named to manage my trust died very soon after my mother. we're still working out the details with a canadian lawyer about some confusion over who handles what and how now but i have the full support of my remaining aunt and uncle who are the same great people i remember. they were really worried about me when i went to live with dad and had tried to contact me so many times.

"new york - i've been visited by cps 8 times, to enquire about a child i don't have. at what point it becomes harassment or stalking?. there's a cps agent that seems to be convinced that i have a child and i'm locking the child in my home. first time i was visited, i was very understanding. i allowed her to search my house without any restrictions. everything seemed fine. obviously no child and no evidence of one, because i don't have a child.

this was repeated 4 times in about 2 months by the same agent, until i stopped cooperating. i told her that from now on the only way i'm going to allow access to my property will be with a search warrant. a few weeks later, she came with a police officer, without a search warrant. the officer told me that it will be a lot easier if i allowed them to look at my house, i allowed the officer to do that by himself. again, no child was found. his search was very thorough, looking for hidden basements or doors in walls or something like that. 

two more times she has visited me to talk about my child and these times i have refused to talk to her. once, as i left home to go to work she was there to ask me questions. it definitely looked like she was waiting right outside my house to get a hold of me. i called the police but it went nowhere. i have called the cps office in my area 4 times to file a complaint but they go nowhere. this last incident happened this last thursday.

this woman has contacted my neighbors, my brother and sister, my coworkers and my employer already. everyone has told her that i don't have a child. 

this definitely seems like a personal obsession on the part of the agent. if this was a legitimate cps operation with reasonable evidence for what they're claiming, i'm sure they could get warrants after all this time and even put me under surveillance i guess? but they've made no efforts to do anything as far as my complaints have gone. so maybe her superiors are in on it, or at least don't care at all.

this is really going too far and is affecting my life. i actually fear for my safety now. i will install security cameras this week and will call the police if i found her waiting around my house but they don't seem to care because she's with the cps.

do i have a legal recourse here? like filing a restraining order against the cps (or against her), or maybe informing some different authorities to press charges for stalking? this definitely seems like it, at least in the layman's definition of the term. not sure how stalking is defined legally. what's the best way to stop her?

"update nc sold them a used car, now they sued me.. a lot of stress was lifted from our shoulders today, thankfully. 

original post here(https://amp.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b2mi6a/nc_sold_them_a_used_car_now_they_sued_me_over_it/)

this morning we had our court date, and let me tell you it was pretty quick. got in at 8:32, out by 8:50. the plaintiff presented her case, in which she said that we hadn't disclosed an airbag light that was on the dash, and that the check engine light code we told them about was false information because it actually turned out to be another issue. said the vehicle had more rust than they originally knew about, and that they hadn't driven it because a mechanic told them it was unsafe to drive. 

we presented our defense, clearly stating they had the opportunity to have the vehicle checked by a mechanic, but chose to take our word for it; and that we brought all known faults to their attention prior to selling them the vehicle. anything they found after they took ownership wasn't our issue anymore, they had all chances to make a proper decision prior. we brought up the ftc's private sale guide stating that all cars sold from private party to private party are ""as-is"" unless otherwise stated. we neither expressed nor implied any warranties. 

long story short, the magistrate dismissed the case with prejudice to the plaintiff  because nc is a ""buyer beware state"" and the buyer should have done all in their power to make an informed decision before purchasing the vehicle. they have 10 days to appeal, but i doubt that's gonna happen. 

thanks to everyone that commented and gave my wife and i more information on the original post. it sure helped!

tl;dr: magistrate heard the case, dismissed it because the buyer should have done more to inspect the vehicle.

i called the police. that led to an argument with the people (at least 2 adults) occupying my house. they told the police they'd been there for 6 weeks. i explained i knew that to be untrue because i was only gone for 20 days. at the end, the officers said it's a civil matter and left.

"a bartender tipped himself $5,000 on my debit card and my local police told me i'm not allow to press charges as long as they're willing to give it back.. basically a bartender gave himself a nice tip on my debit card after only spending about $30 on a few drinks. my account didn't have that much money, but since it was put through as a tip the original charge of $30 which went through changed to $5,041.75, which put my account at negative a couple thousand.


i went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. he said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. i get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but i said i still wanted to press charges. the officer said i literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

so i'm wondering here that how the fuck can someone try to rob you of 5k but its totally cool that once he's caught that he's sorry and will give it back?

i was refunded the 5k to my account, but now i have a shit load of overdraft fees because i use paypal to pay for my recurring payments (phone, spotify, hbo, etc.) every time paypal attempts to charge me, my bank tacks on another $35 overdraft fee. i've already been to the bank and opened the fraud dispute, but i only received a letter saying it'll take 60 days. i do not drive and i'm dependent on uber/lyft to get to work and i can't use that with a negative balance and my phone is about to be shut off because of this. every time i check my account, it's just further in the negative and i don't know what to do.

"parents took $6000 from me without my consent. resulted in homelessness and prevented university education.. i live in alberta, canada. about a year and a half ago, my family got a huge surprise from my great grandfather, who gave us each $5000 with the exception of my mother. i was 17 at the time, and my mother and uncle went to the bank with me to set up a joint account between me and my uncle since my great grandfather wrote the cheques in both mine and his name for some reason.

my father, who was an alcoholic at the time, stated that it would be best that all of the bank cards of the newly created accounts be in his and my mothers hands so that we wouldnt make reckless purchases. at the time, i didnt mind since i was planning to save the money for university, but the main reason i gave the card to them was because my father was not one to cross. hes done things to me in the past, and ive been scared of him since.

all was fine until a couple months later when i decided to pitch into my savings with my job, only to find that the $5000 was gone through multiple purchases.

the tap function was on the card.

i confronted my mother immediately, away from my father, and she agreed to pay back $400 a month. however, this only happened for three months. around the same time this started, my great grandfather, unaware of what happened, sent another $5000. due to a plane ticket i bought to see my gf this august as well as a $500 slash to my paycheque, i was left with about $1000. however, after we transferred the money into my brothers account to keep my father as calm and stable as possible, his account was locked, my mother refusing to open the account.

i burst under the pressure, and was given the boot. while i was in the homeless shelter, i kept asking for the $1000 back to get shelter to find my mother already unlocked the account and gave it to my father. 

i had to drop my classes in high school right before the diplomas because of this. i was unable to get a credit card approved by the bank for application because of the ridiculous transactions, and found that my great grandfather was going to send another $10,000 before he learned of what my parents did. a couple months later, i was let back in, but now theyre telling me ""its gone, money is the root of all evil"". 

i lost my girlfriend after cancelling the trip, lost my university aspirations, and lost much more that id rather not reveal here. what should i do? 

update: after seeing all of the suggestions here and seeing just how many people apparently have my back, i decided to leave the house and go back to the youth shelter while i get myself a lawyer and gather the necessary evidence. thank you all, i never thought this would blow up like this when i went to sleep last night. knowing a couple thousand strangers have my back seems to give me more courage to go about with this action than i did before.

you see, i have about $650-700 in known debt right now, and they're asking me to pay $250 a month for a room even worse than the unfinished basement i was sleeping in before, and giving my mattress away, as i found out just now during the moving preparations. it's still $500 cheaper than the room i paid for per month after getting out of the shelter at my friend's place, but it doesn't feel right, especially with how they're consistently acting as if what they did was nothing. if you guys have any more advice, i'll be sure to take it and update you all with the situation.

the insurance was easy, 100% not at fault for me, all her fault (as i was told is the case for 99% of these types of accidents, where one driver turning left hits a driving going straight). no issues what so ever, they paid off my car and that's it i moved on. 

fast forward about 5 months and i received mail that i believe was sent to my insurance company requesting a bunch of information and that she intends to take legal action against me for what i believe is lost wages, guess she got hurt. 

her police report is attached which includes what she says happened. it doesn't make any sense as she wrote ""he had the green and got hit by me making the turn on a yellow light"" 

the funny thing is, i don't think she knows a driver that was in the inside turning lane beside her stopped and gave me the dash cam footage he had. this footage shows he and the car in-front of him stopping for the red, and you can clearly see her car coming into frame in the outside turning lane on his right after the light is already red, she flies through the red and hits me as i'm moving forward at the green. all very clear on the footage. 

my question is, how can she sue if she's at fault? i'm sure i'll win a case with the footage i have, but what is the likelihood she will have to pay my legal fees? that's what i'm most worried about. 

any thoughts on this situation is helpful.

"update: neighbor touched my son.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor\_touched\_my\_son\_nj/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor_touched_my_son_nj/)

i know the original post didn't get a lot of attention and there probably isn't much demand for an update, but i did want to thank the people who commented and maybe give some guidance on expectations for anybody who might have the horrible luck to fall into a similar situation. also it's just not something we want to talk about with friends/family…. so call it therapy for me.

&#x200b;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

tldr for the 1st post: last monday, soon after i left for night school, my son (5) reported to my wife that our (deaf & mute) neighbor touched his private parts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200b;

update: on tuesday morning the entire family went to the police station to file a report. my wife and i interviewed with an officer and detective together at 1st and then my wife alone. after that the detective contacted the county prosecutor's office.

an hour or so later we were on our way to a county facility, so we could all be interviewed by a couple of detectives from the county prosecutor's office. once interviews were over the county detectives sat down with my wife and i to let us know my son had given them some actionable information and they intended to act relatively quickly. the detective who interviewed the children had tears in her eyes. 

from there we went home.

that afternoon, neighbor knocked on the door, looking to play with the kids. i opened the inner door (left the storm door closed) and made it clear he needed to go away, which he did. soon after i went to night school, asking my wife to stay in doors with the kids for the night, which she did. when i got home, she said nothing else had occurred.

for the most part, wednesday was quiet and relatively normal. we did not see neighbor all day. wednesday night, we came to know why. a detective called to let us know neighbor had been taken into custody on tuesday night (while i was at school) and would remain in custody for a few days until his hearing (i assume arraignment).

thursday morning a woman from the state dcf/cp&p office came to the house. she made a cursory check of the house and interviewed my wife & i together. to my mind, this was actually a good thing.  she was able to let us know that neighbor had been charged with 2 counts (i don't recall exactly what they are). she also provided 2 other important facts:

1 – neighbor had a history, albeit old (late 80s, early 90s) and in california.

2 – neighbor had admitted the act to the detective that arrested him on tuesday evening.

from there, she advised we were entitled to have my son evaluated by a state specialist and possibly therapy if necessary. we will need to have them check in with us once a month until the case is closed on their end, and the evaluation etc. will necessarily extend that time frame, but we opted to go this route anyway.

while she was there i asked if she knew what the likely penalty was (she did not), and whether or not she thought we should pursue a restraining order, if neighbor was likely to be free again soon. she was unsure and promised to check in with the detectives on the subject.

friday (yesterday) afternoon, we received a call from the county detective. she informed us that neighbor's hearing was set for monday and that his lawyer intended to ask that he be released to his home, with an ankle monitor, for the period between the hearing and his trial. she wanted to ask for our input as to how hard the prosecutor should push to have neighbor remain in custody.

here's the thing. neighbor, so far as we can tell, actually lives with a family… and they have small children. i advised the detective that we were ok with neighbor being 'home', so long as he was confined to (approximately) his property. she confirmed that would be the case, and that a 'no contact' order would be in place. we agreed that was ok with us, but also said we felt strongly the family with whom neighbor lives should have input.

that brings us up to date and, to be honest, i am torn. i hate what this man did. i hate that it has happened before, and i never want it to happen again. with that said, at first i was unsure as to whether or not neighbor even knew what he did. he clearly has some emotional/intellectual challenges. but he also knew, at least to some extent, what he was doing…. as he admitted the act to the arresting detective. i get the feeling he is something akin to a deaf/mute lennie from of mice & men, and that tears my heart out. i don't think he really understands, and i don't want to be vindictive to someone like that. at the same time, he touched my son. if there were no clear impairment, i would want to take a baseball bat to his head. but there is, and instead i just feel like shit for everyone involved. this sucks, full stop.

on a more selfish note, the megan's law registry. there are a handful of homes for sale in the area. until now, my wife and i were hopeful that more families with children would move into the area. that hope is now over. because neighbor's history all predates mega's law, he was not on the registry. now he will be, and no families with kids will move into the area. i realize this is tangential to the main topic, and pretty self-centered, but it's just one more way that neighbor is going to make our lives a smidge worse, just by existing. to repeat myself, this sucks, full stop.

sorry for the book, and if the mods see fit to remove the update… as it's not all that particular to legal matters, i understand. honestly, i just feel a bit better getting it all down and putting it out there.

thanks to anyone who reads through.",2
"i'm a pedestrian who waved in an suv in a narrow gap and he got into an accident and he's threatening to sue me.. this happened a few days ago. i live in philly and i was walking along a busy street and i see this suv at a one-way narrow street waiting to move forward at a green light. there is a small car ahead of him that's turning right. the suv wasn't moving past the car because he thought he didn't have enough room. i saw that he did and i just gave him a thumbs up that he can go. he ended up hitting the other car (he was trying to avoid the curb i guess and turned at the last second). 

they got into a bit of an argument and shared info and decided to call the police to make a claim i think. i didn't really listen but the other guy (in the small car) asked me to hang back and provide a witness in case he needs it since i saw the whole thing. they both shared each others insurance and id.

the suv guy asked me for my id for witness too for his insurance claim. soon after he took a picture of my id on his phone he said i was the reason he moved and that he will have to make a claim against me. he is threatening to sue me and said that he would rather just send me the damage bill of both of the cars. i felt bad because i gave him the thumbs up that there was room but he did turn at the last second. the other guy was also annoyed that i shouldn't have told him to go. 

he called and left a vm that i need to act soon because if he makes a claim in a court it would lead to a lot of legal fees for both of us or something. he said that if i agree to pay i can just pay half of the damages.

i'm worried that it's going to be a huge amount and i don't want to go to court. if it goes to court will i have my credit ruined? sorry i don't know too much legal stuff!

edit: now he is saying that my future will be screwed and my credit score is going to be messed up and that there is a possibility that i may be criminally convicted?? i am an immigrant here on a visa and i am worried that it's going to affect me!

edit 2: hey guys, thank you so much for your support! this has been really helpful. however, i am getting conflicting advice here. some are saying that the other person (suv guy) has a case and it seems like there have been cases similar to this. some are telling me that i am absolutely guilty and should have everything taken from me! also i am not sure who ayan rand (legal author?) is and how this affects me? i spoke with a legal hotline service and they said that they are not sure of the laws but i need to get a notarized letter from the suv guy saying that i won't be sued if i choose to pay. i am honestly super scared and stressed that my immigration status will be affected (like the guy said). should i be contacting immigration lawyer too?",2
"manitoba, canada (update) my cousin's landlord enacted a new rule that states ""lights out by 10pm"" - and is enforced by the landlord using the breakers to shut off all power, despite my cousin paying for his own electricity.. previous post can be found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bsdyro/manitoba_canada_my_cousin_lives_in_a_basement/

my cousin and i want to thank all of you for the incredible amount of advice and support you have offered him. he couldn't believe how many people cared, and was touched by the very kind messages we have received by you fine folks. thank you so much! this situation was resolved rather quickly, so thankfully it's all over.

now for the update: my cousin is moving out this weekend. he spoke to the landlord several times, citing several laws he was breaking and how my cousin pays for his own power and therefore he shouldn't have his electricity shut off just because the landlord wants to save a few dollars. also, one of you messaged me to let me know that breakers aren't meant to be turned on and off frequently, and that he is going to burn out all of his fuses if he continues. the landlord refused to listen and told him he shouldn't believe everything he reads on the internet. my cousin went ahead and printed out many comments from you folks, as well as copies of the laws he was breaking, and he told him that if he doesn't stop he would get authorities and lawyers involved. needless to say, the landlord did not like that one bit. after an argument, the landlord stated that my cousin should move out as he didn't trust him anymore (???) and my cousin was genuinely sad as he liked this man and had considered him a friend before all of this. the landlord said that he will not change his mind no matter how hard my cousin fights it, and that it's best that he just moves out.

anyways, the landlord told him that if he moves out he will void the lease and return the rent he has paid up for june, july, and august, as well as the security deposit - all under the condition that he moves out by the end of the month and doesn't get lawyers or anybody else involved. my cousin decided to cut his losses and move on. luckily, my cousin is a minimalist and has very little to pack and move. he is going to be moving in with his girlfriend, which he is very happy about, and he will not be pursuing anything against the landlord as he got all of his money back (about $3000) and he doesn't have to deal with james ever again.

while my cousin didn't get the outcome he wanted, he still got a pretty good deal. he was planning on living with his girlfriend sometime in the near future, so this event just sped things along. my cousin and i honestly feel bad for james as the man has gone through a lot and has had a pretty rough life. still, this doesn't excuse his behaviour and nonsensical rules.

and that is it. thank you all again for your help and support, it was honestly overwhelming. take care, you beautiful people.

edit: since i'm getting nasty messages, i figured i should edit this to let everyone know that i have finally convinced my cousin to report him. he will be reporting the moment he has moved out - which is saturday. we are also looking to get him help for his declining mental health. also, my cousin already received every dime owed to him, in cash, and he received a revised contract stating that the lease was voided as of june 1st, and that no further payments will be required.

there you go folks. please stop insulting my cousin and i.",2
"cop took my plates, wont give them back. bought new car, legally transfered my old plates to my new car. got pulled over in mi, cop wont accept paper work from me or directly from dmv. wisconsin/michigan. in wisconsin when you title a new car you can transfer your old plates. i do so following instructions. you send in the approved application/e-reciept with the title, both signed and dated. 

you keep a copy of everything as well. on the bottom of the e_reciept it stats 'operation of this vehicle is legal when you place the documents listed in the mail for delivery to:....'. 

i got pulled over in mi for an unrelated reason(not important but i can go into detail if you want) he couldnt find anything in their data base connecting my current car with the plate. thats to be expected because of how soon it was. he also did not like the paper i have from the dmv with the above quote. he then had it impounded and removed the plates. that was last night.

i ask him exactly what he needs from the dmv to prove that the plates belong with my car. he says he needs some paperwork directly from them. i have the dmv fax and email him all paperwork involved they have, and he still wont accept it until its fixed in their system where he can electronicly check it. which is different proof then what he asked for earlier. they even call him to explain that its legal for me to drive. unfortunatly they cant put it in electonicly until at least monday when they get the stuff i mailed in. in the meantime my car is racking up impound fees and i have a court date for driving with improper plates. what do i do?",2
"airport confiscated insulin. my diabetic (t1) mother flew from michigan to florida today with a connecting flight in philadelphia. she has been having a lupus flare up, so i arranged for a wheelchair for her weeks ago to take her to her gates/baggage claim. i also confirmed that she could bring a medical bag with get insulin and medication. when she landed in philadelphia, they said they didn't have a chair for her so she had to walk across multiple terminals to get to her gate. when she was boarding the plane, the ticketing agent told her she couldn't bring the medical bag on board (basically an insulated lunch box). she explained it had insulin in it which she needs to have with her. they told her she could check it or she could stay in philadelphia, but she couldn't bring it on board. she surrended the bag, boarded the plane super upset. when she landed in tampa, the wheelchair guy was waiting for her. he took her to baggage claim and i guess her medical bag was lost. she is now in florida with no insulin, no medication. her doctors are working with her insurance to get authorization for her get enough to hold her over. 

i am beyond upset. i have called aa and they confirmed that insulin is allowed on board. what legal ramifications are there for this?

"private driveway being used as public roadway and im being accessed for its upkeep (fl). purchased 30 acres of land and built a house several years back in central florida, had a driveway installed that cuts across the center of my property allowing me to exit on either of two main roads.

i now have traffic using my driveway as a shortcut between the two roads up to and including 18 wheelers and other large vehicles since using my driveway cuts off nearly half an hour of travel time between two cities.

i installed pillars and gates on both ends of the driveway and marked it private property but the gates were torn down and the pillars knocked over.

i have contacted the county about it and they sent out a guy from code compliance who looked around for a few minutes and left.

i have now received a notice about not keeping the roadway to state standards and that the county will be out to perform maintenance bringing the roadway up to standards, ie. widening it and repaving which i will be personally responsible for paying for.

ive told them if they want it to be a public road then fine buy me out and ill move elsewhere but they refuse to do so.

as of right now i have removed half the driveway past my house and put up signs and markers stating dead end road and now the county is threatening to have me arrested for destruction of public property.

&#x200b;

before anyone asks, no, there are no easements on this property anywhere near the area the driveway goes through and no easements in any form that travel in that direction on the property, closest thing is a power company easement along the southern edge of the land.

county has basically turned my private property into public land without using eminent domain and without any compensation.

"mn: someone landed their hot air balloon in my yard and my dogs ripped it.. this past weekend a man with two passengers from a local event went up in a hot air balloon, something went awry and he landed it in my yard. they had been there for a bit when i let my dogs out (balloon wasn't visible from the door or obviously i wouldn't have done so). my dogs are good dogs but frankly hot air balloons are freaking weird and it was new territory for them and they went into a mad panic and attacked the balloon (the people were safe in the basket). i coraled the dogs and they got the balloon hauled out of the yard and into a truck.

last night the pilot of the balloon found my email address and sent me several email addresses for information - first homeowner's insurance, second info on my dog's breed and ages, third my address. i can only imagine where he will be going with this.

i know i need to consult a lawyer if this is going to go somewhere but right now i'm not even sure where to start. am i liable for a balloon my dogs damage that literally lands in my fenced yard? since our property is a notable size we have no tresspassing signs around but they're of course not visible from the air.

&#x200b;

edit: i should mention i googled and the balloon bit that was ripped apparently costs tens of thousands. so that's why i'm concerned.",2
