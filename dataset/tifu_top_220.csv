"by buying everyone an ancestrydna kit and ruining christmas. earlier this year, ancestrydna had a sale on their kit. i thought it would be a great gift idea so i bought 6 of them for christmas presents. today my family got together to exchange presents for our christmas eve tradition, and i gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

as soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. she told us how she didn't want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. we explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

fast forward: our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

tl;dr i bought everyone in my family ancestrydna kit for christmas. my mom started freaking. now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

update:  thank you so much for all the love and support. my sisters, brother and i have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. no matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

update 2: christmas isn't ruined! my fu actually turned into a christmas miracle. turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. a good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. they never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. this is a christmas we will never forget. and yes, we are all excited to get our test results. merry christmas everyone!

p.s. sorry my mom isn't a whore. no you're not my daddy. ",4
"by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.. the overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. i bought a replacement bulb but when i put that one in it was also barely lighting up so i realized the unit was bad.  

the fan still worked great, it literally is the best fan i've ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. the fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so i didn't really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn't get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


so since then over the years my wife and i have had to make due with no overhead light. we open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. it's never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so i keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

after 6 years of living in the dark, this winter i just decided i would replace the damn thing. but before i did, i decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it's possible both bulbs i had tried were bad. 

so i'm up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as i'm turning the light on i realize:

the goddamn thing is dimmable. 


for 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to ""dim"". 

fuck me. 

tl;dr

for 6 years i lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",4
"by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.. today was the day i realised i messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

for the last 12 months i've been commenting on peoples posts, i've created my own posts. i haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as i can remember so i just figured i wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

last month i started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, i could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

anyway, i finally mailed the help team and found out my ip was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, i'm still in my own little truman show)

if you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

tl;dr i was muted one year ago and didn't notice. since then i've spent the whole time thinking how boring i must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

edit: so i've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! wilson and i thank you xx

edit 2: this is crazy! thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things i know nothing about. i'll figure it out and pay it forwards! special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - mvps!

please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that i've been such an idiot for so long. it's ok to laugh with/at me :)

edit 3: reddit is awesome. i've missed you guys! dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real pita. its just one of those things and i thank them for putting in the hours.

i also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. most of us here use reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

i love all of you weirdos <3

edit 4: no more i promise. i'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. i'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. i created an /ama when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/egcbe6w

stop giving me gold! i appreciate it but give to charity instead! heres something different we could do <3

"i have officially branded myself as the biggest perv... and i 100% deserve it.... this is his now ex-wife.

did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same reddit app? i logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.

i've removed all of this personal story for my family's protection and changed this account's password. although it might be too late and already circulated online.

i took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

i'm only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags do not.

i came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. i saw his update saying i seemed alright, but i was keeping it in for the next morning.

reason we slept in the living-room is because i didn't want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before i finished packing. it wasn't ""fun camping"" or a ""picnic"".

this morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

i went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

i'm not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this reddit gold to the comments that i feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

oh, and if you can read this, i've deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.

"by wearing a shawl, which ruined my relationship with my gf. minor background: i am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. i'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that i was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but i also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. i'm not gay, i just am me.

so while i was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. mine makes me look like a star wars character and his looks like the outlaw josey wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. the first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. whatever. so i get a call from my gf, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so i bid these mean girls and shawlbro adieu and head home.

i'm still wearing the shawl when my gf arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until i take it off. we get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if i'm gay. and she's really serious and aggressive about it. i tell her i'm not, that if i was i'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that i own a shawl. anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. so yesterday i invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to the big city, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually i just tell her very politely to get fucked because i'm pretty insulted by this point. on the way back, now that i'm not directly in front of her, i get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because i wore a shawl.

later on, i tell shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

we are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.

tl;dr: me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.

she's a nice girl, she's just not pickin up what i'm puttin down. it's a silly thing to be mad about.

"by swiping on my girlfriend's phone nsfw. so this happened a few days ago and i'm still not sure i'm 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

i've been with my girlfriend for about a year and i already know she is the love of my life. she's perfect for me. we're perfect for eachother. we're getting ready to move in with eachother and i want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

we went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

she went to the bathroom while i had her phone, and as i was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. if you have an iphone you know what i'm talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you're back at the start of the photo album. it's annoying as hell.

but some photos caught my eye. some photos that i really shouldn't be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

there she is, the love of my life, trying to get her mouth around the biggest dick i've ever seen in my life. i've watched porn - a lot. i've never seen a dick like this. i'm talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. longer and thicker. as far as i could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

i could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

i closed the pictures and i've acted like nothing has happened, but i cannot get these images out of my mind. i've never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats i'm significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

we haven't had sex since. i can't concentrate on my work. i just wish i had never seen those damn pictures.

tl;dr accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

/r/tifu last weekend. ,4
"by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.. recently, i traveled to denver, colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  as a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing i was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  what could possibly go wrong?

so the first thing i do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  and oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""are you looking for a mellow body high?  or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""yes, yes and yes!""  i reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  in hindsight, if i learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  sure, i can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite avogadro's number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

and it was at this dispensary that i also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and i were staying at).  as a result, before leaving, i begged my wife to buy some edibles that i could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  after expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

when we finally get back to the hotel room, i tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  what the fuck, denver?  seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that i should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" i read silently as i start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  but what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  so a second later, i covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

and then i quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  we may not have legal weed back home, but i routinely devour an entire package of milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

about 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  and that's when things start to go tits-up.  my stomach growls.  loudly and angrily.  my wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""diarrhea?""  but i merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""you didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""of course not."" i respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

a few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  i don't remember how i made it to my seat, and i don't remember even looking at the menu, but i do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if i was doing alright.

""keep it together, man,""  i say to myself.  but my wife's sudden groan suggests that i may have also said that to the waiter.  things are going downhill fast.

the waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

the moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  i start to worry that the jig is up.  

""you are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  not quite knowing what to do, i reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

at this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" i reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

my wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""bathroom. now."" she hisses. ""get it together.""  i reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  after splashing several handfuls of water on my face, i approach a urinal and start to pee.  

now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  as i am peeing, i start to get the very unsettling feeling that i have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

but deep down i know that is absurd:  i've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  i've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  so given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like i am about half way done -- that means that i've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

but the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  i try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

after finally finishing, i again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

next, i try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but i am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- i figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  to my wife's horror, i stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  but he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  he also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, i should probably eat one or two so that i'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

smart man. 

however, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, i start to get worried that i need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""do you think i should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" i suggest helpfully to my wife.

""what?! we literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

and at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""how many cookies did you eat?!"" she demands.

""whoa, easy there, torquemada,"" i respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""i had a few cookies, but keep it down.  i don't want your parents to know how fucked up i am right now.""

""really?!  they are sitting two feet away from you.  they know.""

i look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

tl;dr: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


edit:  wow!  thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  i think i have officially peaked in life.

as for part ii of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  at that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before i either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  so after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a secret service agent evacuating the president.  my night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  but being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""please don't die, we have a mortgage.""",4
"by accidentally getting sexual with my dentist, again.. i'm a 32 year old woman who can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because i'm an idiot.

i had my second dentist appointment today. i actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. he had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. his face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. i was a bit concerned and also confused. like how could i have embarrassed him this time? i had hardly spoken! so he keeps working in there and then i realize what the hell is happening. my dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. i had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time.

"by having my reddit history revealed by jimmy kimmel live on tv. this happened to me yesterday and i'm still baffled.

it all started when i posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor william h. macy. i couldn't stop laughin over it but i never thought it would gain so much attention. 

however it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes i could have imagined. this alone was crazy for me because i never expected to have a submission on the front page.

when i checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links i received. i checked them and found my submission on the latest jimmy kimmel show with reddit co-founder alexis ohanian. i was mind blown over this.

they proceeded talking over reddit users and jimmy ended up checking my history. well i hardly ever post filthy stuff but i commented on a nsfw a few days ago and i think jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

i don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. on the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. however i regret nothing!

tl;dr: jimmy kimmel had reddit co-founder alexis ohanian as a guest. they ended up browsing my reddit history and jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

"by cumming into a coconut. edit: i got an ama thread now. help me: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu


this didn't happen today but quite a few years back. for obvious reasons i'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

anyway, around 8 years back i lived in northern mozambique, a coastal southern african country with quite a warm climate. my mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. one of these was coconuts. she would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


anyway, being a horny teenager i fapped in regular intervals. unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and i was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. one day i hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. honestly to this day i can't fathom why i thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


i end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. i decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. i fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so i blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

for the next week the coconut is my saviour. whenever i want to get off i simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. it's heaven. now before i continue i'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


about a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (i had been using it pretty much every day since then) i begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. must be the coconut right? so i decide that i'll fuck it once more before i throw it out and get a new one.


**worst mistake i have ever made.**


you see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. as i penetrate the coconut one last time i begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. puzzled, i pull my cock out to discover that it is covered in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *teeming with tiny fucking maggots*. they were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


i screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck i was doing with my life. 


**never again. never again.**


tl;dr don't fuck coconuts.



edit: jesus this exploded. i'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because i sure cry everytime i think back to it.

"by asking reddit which ethnic group to exterminate. today i had been looking forward to the qualifying for the formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing reddit whilst also watching some older formula 1 footage on youtube. so it got me wondering, ""some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they're just boring and far too controlled"". so i posed the question to /r/formula1 to ask their opinions also. shortly after posting, it transpired that the way i had asked the question could be perceived as...a little...'hitlerish'. check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. it somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. unfortunately for me, i am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that i must open every single one. it would actually play on my mind so badly that i wouldn't be able to sleep if i didn't open them, so i must open and read every goddamn comment. probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. i thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where i was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. but then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ usa woke up. and i've been playing catch-up ever since. took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. let's see what i go back to now...

i'm really glad that i could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn't the original intention, but it's a great positive to take away from this experience!

edit 2: update - at around 20:20pm gmt, i opened up alienblue on my ipad to read these comments faster than on the official reddit app, and when i started from there i had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, i now have 976 unread messages -.-

edit 3: update - it's now 21:09pm gmt, i did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it's back up in the 4 digits. i am seriously sleep deprived right now, i have been awake since 16:00pm yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. finally they've subsided and i'm feeling really tired now, so i shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. i honestly didn't think this post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

edit 4: finally i'm able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. back down under 1000 left to go now, and it's been a truly interesting experience. i didn't realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, i also didn't expect some of the truly deplorable messages i have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. it's 6:00am gmt here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

edit 5: final edit, i'm now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17am. it's been great to see this happen, and i'm sorry to those who thought reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

tl;dr - made a post asking a question, worded it wrong and now everyone thinks i'm a racist bastard.",4
"by telling my son's new doctor we are anti-vaxx. obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

my son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. we decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. i brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which i reply, ""oh, no he can't have that, i don't want him to get autism.""

i should maybe note here that i am an aspie too, and while i think my sarcasm is on point, i must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. the silence lasted an eternity while i imagine she was deciding how to proceed. eventually i laughed and tried to assure her i was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

as my son and i were discussing whether i was offensive (he thought i was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. he started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. he just kept saying, ""okay, well i have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. 

tl;dr: jokingly told my son's new doctor that i didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.

edit: of course we took the gardasil. shout out to nurse pete for being the first nurse to ever give my kid a vaccine without him crying or fist-fighting everyone. i wish everyone could have a nurse pete. also, since i'm editing, thanks for the awards!",4
"by performing the ""major tom"" technique and now i think i'm going to be disowned. if you aren't familiar with the ""major tom"", it's because it's a thing i (hopefully) came up with. it's a form of ""auto-erotic asphyxiation"" by using gravity.

basically, you jack off normally; but before you nut, you squat down as low as you can to the ground and breathe short shallow breaths while still whacking it. this part is called ""getting in the shuttle.""

as you nut, you jump up from that squatting position as fast as you possibly fucking can and hold your breath. this is considered ""take off.""

if performed correctly, you should become very lightheaded and experience pure bliss due to the orgasm from your cock rocket. this is called ""being in space"" due to the fact you feel like you're floating.

this is a technique that should be performed only by professionals, in a controlled environment. **i, however,** am not a professional despite creating the technique. you see, by hyperventilating and jumping up, you are literally cutting your brain off from oxygen. no oxygen = no consciousness.

when i ""took off"" i fucking jumped up at mach 50 and must've ripped a fucking hole in the goddamn space-time continuum. because the next thing i know i was laying on the ground with my dick out, covered in space juices from my trip around the sun.

before i could even pick myself up off the ground, my mom rushed into my room to see if i was okay. she heard my re-entry. this part is called ""disappointing your mother.""

you can just imagine the scene she walked into.

she stared at me with a mix of disgust, anger, and again, disappointment. i stared back with what i thought was confidence like i was buzz aldrin and just got back from the moon. but thinking back on it, it was probably embarrassment while i was desperately trying to put my space plane back in the hangar while getting on my feet as quickly as possible, and due to the fact, she's never caught me before. (at least not to my knowledge.)

she ended up closing the door and stomping her way back to the living room, presumably to watch more judge judy, and to take her mind off of what she just fucking witnessed; or consider disowning me. i cleaned myself up, taking off my spacesuit and putting civilian clothing on. somehow none of the rocket fuel managed to get in the carpet, just my clothes, and i managed to not even injure myself in the crash.

i'm currently writing this in my room right now, and i don't plan on leaving it anytime soon until i can think of what to say to her. if there is anything to say at all.

**tl;dr: tried a new experimental masturbatory technique, ended up passing out, mom caught me with my pants down, and now i'm stuck in my room. planet earth is blue and there's nothing i can do.**

**edit: only do this if you have a safe place to land if you fall. it is extremely easy to hit your head and die.**

"by agreeing to an ""open relationship"". obviously a throwaway. 

to put things into perspective, i (m 20) and my gf (f 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

we decide to spice things up a bit and ""open"" up our relationship a little. it was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole ""sex is fun"" idea.

she is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she's met a guy (m 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn't working at the time. i agreed. i tell her to go for it, and she does. she texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

the week after, she mentions she's meeting up with this guy again. wasn't expecting it but i'm cool with it. again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. a decision i would live to regret. she doesn't text me the entire night. weird, but okay maybe she's just having a good time?

the next day i receive a load of messages about how she needs a ""break"" from ""everything"" right now. meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. a little more conversation and we're over. she's completely cut me out of her life. i check her snap chat story, and of course, she's with him. i've heard from her friends that they're dating now. 

tldr; agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me.",4
"by sending nudes to my employee group chat.. tldr at the bottom- 

well i recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). with that being said i'm pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. i also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

we have a groupme for the store i work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
the previous night i had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that i was with at the time. no biggie right? 
the next morning i had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. noon rolls around and i needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue i was having with a computer i was working on. 
i typed what i needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as i clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, i hit send without thinking and go on about my day. i should also probably say that by this time i was working alone and closing so no one else was around. the customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left i went to check my phone and saw i had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first i thought he was just calling me about the question i had, while the phone was ringing, i went back to look at the groupme, to my horror i clicked not just a picture from the night before, but the whole damn video. my heart dropped, instantly when i realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my ""intentions"" where with the video and that he's never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. i tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. lol on the bright side the coworker i had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 


tldr: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out i send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end!

"by giving my son permission to beat his bully's ass.. my son was born with a condition called pectus excavatum. in layman's terms, his chest is sunken in. his condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. in december, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

about three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. the kid has been through a lot. 

well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. and because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, ""dad, i'm cleared now. a kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. can i kick his ass?"" well, my son isn't really a fighter. he's fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he's always gotten his ass kicked. so i just figured he was just talking. but this is the first i had heard about the bullying and i was concerned. i could tell he was distressed about the situation so i told him to knock the fucker out. he just nodded and went to his room. 

now, his older brother is s tough sob. he had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he's in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. i talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don't get in trouble. he told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. i asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. while i kinda agree with his thinking, i instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

the next morning i took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. on the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. ""have you taken xxxxx to school yet? well, after you do, go pick up your son. he got in a fight."" i just assumed it was my oldest son. imagine my surprise when i walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! he was beaming! he pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. ""i warned him."" i was so proud. 

he had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. my older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. he said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. he got suspended for three days. 

tl;dr i gave my son permission to beat up his bully because i didn't think he would and he did it.

edit one: the kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. it wasn't malicious. just two boys clowning around. he was horrified that he had hurt my son. the bully punched my son in the head every day. once he found out my son couldn't do anything about it, he just kept on. my son wasn't the only one he bullied, either. also, the bully's brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son could fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

edit two: my son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a lot of new friends. he used to hate going to school but now he's disappointed that school is out for summer. crazy!

edit three: thanks for the precious metals! and holy shit! front page?!?!",4

"by chilling at my friend's place while she wasn't home. my friend jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and i finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  i ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

i made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  dude was intimidating and i'm a 4'11"" woman so i was immediately scared.  he looked shocked to see me.  i'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that i surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

i panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  i'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  i start screaming at him to get the fuck out and that i'm calling the police (total bluff because i didn't have my phone.)  he then yells back that he is calling the police on me.  this gives me pause.  at this point, i look around and realize the bedroom i'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  i ask him through the door if he knows jenna (last name).  he tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  well.  apparently, jenna's neighbor also keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

so, today i fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  

tl;dr today i fucked up by wasting a sandwich.",4
"by sleeping with a married woman.. so, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. nsfw or for anyone, really. and i may not be alive much longer, because i'm probably going to be murdered.

i'm at the bar the other night, watching the hall of fame game. after it's over, i go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before i uber home. this girl sitting next to me, very attractive. out of my league. like wayyy out. i'm just scrolling through memes on my phone. and she asks me 

""hey! can i trust you to watch my things and not drug me?""

 ""uhh what?""

 ""can you watch my stuff while i go pee and not drug me"" 

to which the bartender said ""oh you can trust greg, he's really nice"". annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. just random shit. showed pictures of our dogs to each other. talked about shows n stuff. typical 'meet a girl at a bar' flirting shit. she asks if i've ever seen the show years and years. i say ""no, but i've seen the band perform live"". so she goes on about how great the show is, and how i need to watch it. asks if i have hbogo. ""yes because i forgot to cancel my cable after got"". so she makes me download the app, so i could start watching it when i get home. thanks for the recommendation! i'll probably check it out never. so a few minutes later, she said

 ""hey do you live close by?"" 

""yea, like half a mile""

 ""we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. i have a bottle of whiskey in my car""

""idk, my house is kind of a mess right now""

""that's okay, i have pets too"" (or something like that. all i was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

""i mean i guess, but i have to be at work early tomorrow""

""that's okay, i can only stay 30-40 minutes and then i'll have to go home""
""that's fine"" heh, cuz that's all the time i'll need! am i right, fellas??

no. nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

it's about, 11pm at this point. i think? and mind you, i've only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

so we tab out, get in her car. which is a stick shift. and i say ""oh no shit, i like you even more now! no one drives a stick anymore! i drive one every day!"" which i'm excited about, because at this point i'm thinking to myself ""hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows i like, and imma bout to get laid""

we talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn't the first time that this subject came up). which is just a half mile away. so was a short drive. she parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

go inside, i try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. while i try to get my chromecast set up on my living room tv. ya know, to ""watch hbogo"".

she runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

it's fucking evan williams.

and this is the first time where an ""oh no"" thought crosses my mind.

kids, i've slept with some strange in my time. i don't know how or why i get myself into these situations. i honestly feel that i'm a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. sure i troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but i do genuinely care about other people. being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. but in this case, i was dead wrong.

so after some talking about random shit. we get the show playing. i couldn't even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

sex.

so after, we're just laying there. pillow talk. was a good night. i just got laid. she asked if she could stay the night. we're gonna go to sleep. everything is cool. i let her know that i have to be at work in a few hours, so i need to get some rest.

now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* right?

wrong.

i say ""that was great we should do this again sometime""

""i don't think so""

""what why?""

""i don't think my husband would appreciate that""



i am speechless. i don't think i've ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. like, how the fuck did i not see this coming. omg imma home wrecker. i'm probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

me: ""ummmmmmm what? is this an open relationship? does he know where you're at? like, why didn't you tell me that?""

her: ""idk, does it matter?""

""uh yeah, i'd be pretty pissed if i was him""


now i've been cheated on before. and that feeling sucks. i've been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. where i didn't know that i was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. i had found out a couple days later, and i found him on fb and let him know. he thanked me, and didn't get mad at me at all. cheating is the worse thing ever.

so this is where shit starts to hit the fan. i don't remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

her: ""we're getting separated soon""

me: ""well you're still fucking married to him""

""yea but that's okay""

""how is that okay?""

""he's been..... abusive""


there's a slight pause, then she starts crying. so this is where the sober me starts to kick in. this girl is struggling. she's in a bad spot. and no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. and now i'm trying to empathize with this trashy evan williams drinking bitch. like i legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

que the panic attack.

she starts going nuts. ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. knocking shit over. basically trashing my house.

she asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. which i do. she takes it. and calms down. (for the most part).

now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. i tell her that we need to go to sleep. because i have to work in the morning. she tells me ""(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy"" btw, evan williams isn't that bad when you're slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

we finally get to sleep around 4? maybe? i wake up late, she wants round 3. and who doesn't like morning sex. i'm still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. so i gave her a fuck.

anyways, i need to leave for work. but her car is blocking mine. i tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can't because she didn't know where her clothes were. and told me i couldn't move it because ""i didn't know how to drive it"" 

""uhh, this is the third time we've had this conversation. i drive a stick every day, i can move your car""

i move her car. i leave for work. and i just let her stay at my house. i let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. two, i was already running late, and fuck it she'll probably leave before i get home.

a couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. i get concerned, because i'm starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. i came to the conclusion that i should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... but, i see that she had already messaged him. from my facebook account! my computer was still logged into fb when i left, and i didn't think to log out or shut it off or anything.

i tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. he lets me go home. when i get home, i find her still naked in my bed. i get her friend to get her an uber. and i leave. oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

go back to work. thinking everything is over. that's the end of that. wrong again.

i get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. and only that shirt. like vag all out and everything. this girl is afraid to go home. which i'm worried about at this point. because i want her to go somewhere safe. she's refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

oh yea, she had me find her phone. which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. and several others from other people.

she hands me $20 to order a pizza. and after we eat the pizza, she'd uber home. fuckin bet. i ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

i kid you not. i'm sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. and she just opens her legs and says ""make it quick""

this bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and i'm just ready for her to leave.

sex.

after, we're just sitting there, and she starts crying again. asking to go home. and i'm like 

""i'll get you an uber home, but you gotta put pants on""
""no""

""what do you mean 'no'? you can't get in an uber with your pussy out""

""no""


so i gather up all of her belongings and clothes. and try to help her get dressed. to which she refused to allow me to do.

most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... that ""arch"" thing that women do when you're pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#i had the same feeling when i got her panties on.

pizza arrives. i go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. come back inside. panties are off again. god dammit.

we never even opened the pizza box. she's saying that she wants to go home. but is refusing to get dressed. i'm starting to panic myself. because i don't know how i got myself into this situation. but, am me.

she eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that's she having with her husband. and i read through the conversation, it's her sending multiple texts saying ""i'm so sorry babe"" ""idk where i'm at"" ""come get me"". and him saying ""nope sorry"" ""this is on you"" and ""call 911""

that last one though. that's what i did.

before i called 911, i offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because i knew the husband would give her a ride back there. and not to my house. because now i'm starting to worry about my safety. i don't want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. but then again she states that ""you don't know how to drive my car"" with it being a stick and all. even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

i told them that i have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. etc. i tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn't answer.

the ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. this girl is drunk crying. trying to get me to go for yet another round. where at this point, my dick hurts. also, ""girl you need to get dressed, you're gonna be going home""

finally got her panties back on, i didn't tell her that i had called the cops. i told her that the uber was coming. and was trying to get her to put her pants on.

cops show up, i go outside. explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. but i kept my calm. i told them that i was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. but they can't force her to go anywhere she didn't want to. she wanted to go home. officers ask if she was presentable. i pop my head back in the door. she's still wearing my shirt and her panties. so i'm like ""i guess?"", and then i let them in.

she yells ""are you fucking serious? you called the cops?"" 
""uh yea, you didn't wanna leave. even though you said you did. plus your husband said to call 911, so that's what i did""

the officer said to her ""you're on this man's property, and he wants you to leave""

que crying and what not.

cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. which i do. her husband calls her phone, so i accept the call, and then put it up to her face. tell her to tell him what's happening. and that she is getting an uber home. apparently her card and paypal was getting declined for the ride. so she couldn't do it herself. they live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. i live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a lyft/uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... girl finally decides to get dressed.

i had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... i could see the officer's partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. lol.

anyways, i hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she's still wearing mine) to the officer. made sure she had all of her belongings. we get her to walk out of my house to the uber. but she tried to grab the bottle of evan williams. to where i audibly laughed. ""i don't think they'll let you take that""

cops didn't let her take it. she got in the uber and she was gone. policeman handed me the bottle back. where i say ""usually this is the other way around, ha""

po-po leave, i call it a night, and it's over.

flash forward to today. i get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she's asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. i was at work at the time. so i wasn't able to check. but i'm 98% certain i handed those over to the cops. i look for them when i get home. found nothing.

oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

so that brings us to now. i haven't heard anything from her. or the husband. and i'm not sure if it's safe for me to go home. but ya. know what? fuck it. i'm glad i could share this story with y'all. there might be more to come, but you'll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

the moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

jk don't do that.

and don't stick your dick in crazy.

tldr: took a girl home who i didn't know was married. she trashed my house.

edit: i'm not gonna change ""que"" to ""cue"" because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while i deal with mine.

edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2gia

edit 3: her car is still there. can't get it towed, because it's on a public street. i'm still alive. i see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. i'll get to them when i can.

edit 4: fml. i sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. no response. bartender texted me late last night and asked if i used a condom. which many of you have asked.... and no. i didn't. the girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. so i think i may have been baby baited.

edit 5: i'm still not dead. her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor's house. i just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. so i walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it's front of their house... this woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. and she's most likely high on meth. because when i asked her ""hey do you wanna get this car that's in front of your house towed?"" she said ""no, noooo hehe"" i'm like ""yea, i'll talk to y'all tomorrow"" just wtf.

**update**

i've been texting a mutual friend of the couple. apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. i'm in the works of a tifupdate. but i'll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. i'd like to protect the privacy of those involved, but i'm just too lazy to do it right now.",4
"by complimenting a girl's skirt. happened a couple weeks ago

i was at a party and saw a girl across the room. she was wearing a skirt, holding a drink in one hand and had the other hand in her pocket. i saw her skirt, thought to myself how cool that skirt is having pockets. a lot of women i know complain about not having pockets, so this is a very progressive thing.

a bit later, i got around to talking to her. i complimented her skirt, and how pockets in a skirt is great. she looked very confused, said ""my skirt doesn't have pockets, why would you think that?"" i mentioned that i had seen her earlier with her hand in her pocket. her face went bright red and revealed that her hand was amputated. what i thought was her hand in her pocket, was her stump resting against her hip.

i apologised immediately, but luckily she thought it was funny because she'd never heard that comment before. i'm still dying inside though.

tl dr; complimented a girl on having a skirt with pockets, turns out she just didn't have a hand.",4
"by thinking divorce was an april fools gag. let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

my borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. they told the family they are getting divorced. i broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying i'm no april fool.

*edit*

wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

*edit 2*

i don't think i'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. this blew up and i just got multiple texts from my wife telling me i fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... and i didn't change any names 

*edit 3.0*

ok it's been fun everyone, i may see you all again next week with tifu by making a tifu post about divorce that ultimately lead to my own divorce. 

*edit 4.0*

uhh this post is getting deleted. it's been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.

*edit 5*

final edit. fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on reddit) how big of a dumbass i am.

thanks for everyone who said i'm not the asshole. i may have autism, but i'm not an asshole.

once again was wrong, /pinnacleclub what up

give me a couple days to sleep on releasing the video. i've got it, i've just got to convince my wife to release it. ",4
"update: i fucked up by not knowing the guy i like works on the same floor as me and telling my friend loudly that, ""he could fuck me in the ass."". link to og post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/

two months ago, i fucked up. i was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. i ended up realizing, not in a way that i wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab i work at. 

basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and i were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when i said, ""i would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" he overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. i was so fucking mortified. 

i didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. that didn't happen. on my first day back, i was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""oh fuck,"" i had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that i ought to apologize for my crass comment. but instead, i frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if i do that, he can't see me right? that didn't happen again. instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""hey my name, how was your break?"" 

i looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. he told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. he didn't bring up what happened either thank god. then he said something along the lines of, ""is that all your having for lunch?"" and i was like, ""uhm yeah, i was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

then he said, ""oh i was gonna go grab something to eat at a sandwich place near us, do you wanna come with?"" 

i was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. i tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so i said sure and we went. 

well. we ended up having a great lunch. inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""so tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think i spent staring at you?"" i literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""it has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? that has to mean i like you."" (btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

even with my shock, i managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

we have not done the butt stuff. he told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. looks like i will be retaining my butt virginity and i managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

tl;dr: despite my fuck up, it all worked out. we're celebrating one month together tomorrow! also, i'm a girl (got two comments asking if i was).

edit: yes, i accidentally wrote ""guess"" instead of ""guest."" my b, my b. ",4
"by genuinely forgetting i had a joint in my pocket and trying to board a plane in amsterdam and getting caught.. so this literally just happened 30 mins ago. 

i would freely and happily admit if i tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. 

came with a couple of friends for the weekend to amsterdam for a birthday. it's a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

i'm sure most people know the dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit 'coffee shops' and buy and smoke joints. 

had a fun party night last night in town. went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

in a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, i put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...'did i ditch that joint'?

at this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

'sir, do you have anything in your pockets' says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

holy. fucking. shit. what to do? i'm still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. do i come clean? no way-too late for that. got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. 

go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. but, schiphol airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. i'm asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. i'm sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did i smoke that joint??? airport guys hands pats pocket. i feel object being pressed into hip. fuck fuck fuck. 

'sir, empty your pocket please'? says airport guy. my partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. in slow motion i see the penny drop on his face. i dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. i feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

i'm dying inside. i say to pat down guy, 'oh god. i'm really sorry, i forgot that was in th...'
'haha, sure, sure - thats what they all say'! laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

i'm placed to one side. customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, 'don't worry sir! don't look so scared! you are 20th today and you won't be last! i'm sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately i can't let you leave amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home'. 

i almost wept with relief. i was made to sign a form to say he'd taken joint off me....and that was it...

i'm in a bar in schiphol airport in amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. to all you dutch-bless your hearts. you're the best. i'm sorry i was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

tldr i was a hot mess and genuinely forgot i had a joint in my pocket. got caught with it. dutch customs were amazing about it. 

edit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)

edit 2, thanks for the shiny stuff. first awards (on a story about my drug use).  i'm from uk for those asking.. my flights just landed and i made it through uk customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. i've just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. it says under what was taken, 'joints'.

"by getting reddit banned in russia. today reddit was blocked in russia, and i am the one who posted this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/rudrugs/comments/1derq9/%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%b8_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b4_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%89%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%bf%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b1%d1%8b/) which lead to this.

in russia, there is a law which allow roskomnadzor, russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. two years ago i tested how rkn react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. on of that websites was reddit.

one thing i learned is that rkn doesn't want to block popular websites. they respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. it was on 05/21/2013(https://img.bi/#/vn0xdfz!sufwaazuq0ogfp6njqpmgqpwensqfa4kln1gdqhz). on 10st aug 2015 they posted a call to help them contact reddit administration(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official vk page. funny thing, but they called psilocybe a plant. several hours ago they reported that reddit is blocked in russia(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). seems like things changed.

how reddit is blocked? fully. as reddit switched to https, there is no way to block special page.

will i remove this post? no. i also think that reddit administration needs to do nothing. this is important issue on freedom of speech, and only rkn want to violate it.

btw, this post is a guide for indoor growing psilocybe mushrooms in russian. i'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to rkn.

"by trying to gift my bf some sweet undies and subsequently spoiling his surprise proposal plans.  about three weeks ago, i began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who i'll call ""ray,"" to celebrate 4 years of dating.

we live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. he's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. i thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt i get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. they are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

i ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. i used his email on the sign-up so that i could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

one small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. i sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which i mean i entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. i simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. i know how to do this because i'm a brilliant hacker (i googled it).

while carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: a shipping confirmation for an engagement ring. i immediately noped off his computer, and of course i didn't open the email, but the damage is done. secret's out!

my heart fell right through my butt, you guys. i actually died and now i'm a ghost writing this.

i probably should have pretended i never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but i was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. within the hour i broke down and called ray to sheepishly confess what i had done. he wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that i spoiled the surprise. 

here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

my punishment for snooping is that the suspense is killing me. i've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

a romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, i thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""why would you think that i'm going to propose to you?"" he said. ""that sounds like something you wouldn't know about because i'd keep it secret in my personal email!""

now he's started intermittently faking me out. the other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. he keeps getting down on one knee... looking up at me... and saying, ""gotta tie this shoe!"" the emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is maddening. every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

one more thing: i somehow fucked up the email settings. the shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. so that surprise got spoiled, too. turns out i'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

i guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and i do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

if we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

after  a few minutes of mindless wandering, i notice her on the other side of  the store. i also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as i'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, i hear someone behind me shout ""hey creep! why are you  taking a picture of that girls ass!?"" i turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

i  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. my wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that i had to leave. she explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

the employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. honestly i'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. it was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

"by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.. so, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. one of the classes i was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. while the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. for our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. i did my paper on helium-3 power generation. i worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. the papers were due last night at midnight and i held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. this is where i fucked up big time.

let me tell you a little about myself. i don't work a normal job. i tried it in my first year of school and i really didn't like it. i've worked internships when they came up but outside of that i really didn't ""work"". this and being a student really doesn't mix well though. so, i had to make money some way. for the past 3 years i've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. specifically, for furries. i would write anything. any fetish, any premise, anything. in some parts of that community i became really popular. at one point i was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts i charged  to my customers. am i proud of this? no. i have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. i told myself the minute i got a ""real"" job i was cutting and running from this work.

well, this brings us to last night. i had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. i had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. i was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. i was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. i ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. however, instead of submitting my final paper, i somehow submitted one of the commissions i was working on. this commission is not light either. it is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

so, i went to bed. submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. when i woke up this morning i checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

i want to fucking die right now. i don't know how i'm going to explain why instead of my final i submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. but yeah, i fucked up big time.

tl:dr: in my final semester at college. instead of submitting my final research paper, i submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. professor ""want's to talk"" and i want to die.

well, i just left his office and i still want to die. not as much though. i took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  i won't lie, when i sat down with him i was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. i guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

i ran down pretty much everything i said here. while he didn't agree with the avenue i was taking to make money he understood why i was doing it.

he had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""customer\_commission\_2nd draft.doc""). i've taken a class from him before and was an a student so he guessed i had submitted the wrong file on accident. he told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

i gave him the copy i brought and he accepted it. he told me to email him the file and he would replace the one i had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" he seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what i had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

like i said. i still want to fucking die right now. at least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . thanks i guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown.",4
"by finding a flashdrive and looking what was on it.. i found a flashdrive in my home and was curious as to what was on it. i put it in the computer and find folders full of family pictures and a video. it was blurred in the thumbnail, so of course i have to play it. 

it all happened so fast.

i see a dick. a hard, throbbing cock, staring me right in the eye.

and then it's cumming.  

and after the last bit of cum drops, the camera gets aimed downward and i see my dad's shoes and the tile in our bathroom. 
i just watched my dad shoot his fucking load all over the bathroom tile. this dude filmed himself cumming in the bathroom. 

he moved out a long time ago and obviously forgot that this flashdrive was here. i'm not going to give it back. i'm not going to assert dominance and return the favor. i'm going to burn it with fucking fire. 

tl;dr: i met my siblings today.

edit: with all the attention this is getting, i'd like to turn this fuck-up into something positive. please consider donating to prevent child abuse america(https://preventchildabuse.org/)

edit 2: fuck. the site got hugged to death lmao. sorry you guys.",4
"by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye.. well, fuck. 

not a throwaway because i have no shame left to feel. 

by orgasming so many times i went blind in one eye. that's right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

seriously, though. last night i was trying to sleep (obligatory ""not technically today"") but failing miserably. i have bipolar disorder, i'm off my medication (that is a in itself), and i was in the early stages of a manic episode. for those who aren't batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. i tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my mothman musical, and thinking about al gore. at about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, i decided i had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

enter stage left lesbian porn. here's the part where i mention how my clit is made of steel. i came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. for some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. having finished the porn (which i actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) i decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. now, whenever i'm jerking off to just my vile thoughts, i always have to go completely under the covers. unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where i live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? anyway, for some reason i can't come on my own if my head isn't under some blankets/cloaked. maybe saudi arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? since this incident i've only slept for four hours. i'm losing my mind. 

anyway, at this point i'm abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. after ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. my clit breathes a sigh of relief and i emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. my right eye is stinging a little bit, and i realise the acne treatment i'd put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. i grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

i'm sure you can see where this is going, but i certainly didn't. and now i could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. i wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. the weird angle i'm bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. for some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. i felt genuinely betrayed. like, how dare you? you did this to me. this is your fault. et tu, clite? 

once my eye starts to swell up, i call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. arguably the weirdest walk of shame i've ever done. 

i continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn't go down, an eye patch. the swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. my eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of ""what the fuck have i done"" red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

now i've got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that i'll probably have to cancel. i've been wanting to bang this guy for weeks. also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and i can't even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish i'm shit out of luck. 

tl;dr: i masturbated and now i'm
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

edit: sweet baby jesus's clit, what the fuck? this blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if i wrote it. damn my unforgettable mothman musical. anyway, i did not cancel my dick appointment. i told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (less endearing when i got to his place and wouldn't stop dirty talking using pirate puns. i've never been more grateful for the colloquialism ""booty""). also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. hallelujah.

edit #2: clearly the reddit detectives have all suffered a stroke because numerous people have been sullying my good name in the comments with accusations of heterosexuality. to clarify: i'm bi. also, thanks for all the cool shit and stuff, i guess.",4
"by letting my son take my wife's menstrual cup for show and tell. my wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. sometime over the weekend i noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. i asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it's versatility- over the next few days it helped the paw patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. it came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. i loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. 

fast forward to this morning and as we're getting ready for school alexa reminds us that it's show and tell today at school. so my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. i pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. my son looks happy so i figure he's not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he's proud of. 

our conversation:

teacher: ben's show and tell was...interesting. 

me: yea! it's cool right? we've been playing with that thing for days. 

teacher: uh, mr. scott, do you know what that is?

i start to panic- oh shit it's not a toy...

teacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. 

i get confused. 

teacher notes my confusion: it's um, used to collect menstrual blood...

i'm still confused...

teacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood

me: it just...stays in there? 

she nods. 

me: are you sure? i don't think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. 

teacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....

we're both clearly uncomfortable. 

me: alright then.....so where do i get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. 


my wife laughed hysterically when we told her. my son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.

tl:dr thought my wife's menstrual cup was a toy and my son and i played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell

edit: wow!!!! i cannot believe this got so much attention. i'm glad everyone got a good laugh. a bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn't know it was me, though. 

my wife has been reading the comments and insisted that i clarify that i know all about her cycle. we are ttc currently and, just as it was with our son, i know when she's ovulating, i track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. i grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices i was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. i was also confused by it ""fitting"" because, like i said, this device helped save a chickoletta over the weekend. i've seen a tampon- they're much slimmer than this cup is. my wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn't even feel it's presence after it's im position. 

i'd like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife's approval.",4
"by hiding my staple addiction and making my family think i was a heroin junkie. ever since i was a kid, i loved to fiddle around with staplers. playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. one of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. there are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes i'd break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. i've even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&#x200b;

this progressed from me messing around with staples in ms. grady's second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. i had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? well...

&#x200b;

fast forward to present day. i am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. i have a home, a normal car, an office job. i am by all accounts a normal human being... **i still love staples.** working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. i'd spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. it got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&#x200b;

so i had to stop doing that...i turned to amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. it wasn't enough. i went to 20, then 40. my wife got curious then and asked ""why are you buying all of these boxes of staples"". but i brushed it off as a work issue that i'd get reimbursed for and knew i had to change my methods.

&#x200b;

over the course of a few months i enabled myself...i started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. i would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. i began to stay out late and tell my wife i would be home soon, so i could go buy more staples from different stores. i opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn't know but she caught it in the mail. she got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&#x200b;

this past thursday after one of my ""late nights"" i get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. i walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. because it is.

&#x200b;

my wife asked if there was anything i wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. i sat down and kept saying ""what are you talking about"" until my mom said ""honey, we saw the pictures"". then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. this man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me ""do something"" with what i had in the bag from multiple stores. it basically looked like i was a drug runner for office depot who was using some of the product for myself. at this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. i had to come clean and all i could muster was

&#x200b;

""i...i like staples.""

&#x200b;

the wtf looks i got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when i showed them my car....i came clean. i backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. right now my only concern is my dad. he didn't laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&#x200b;

believe it or not, i think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. i may or may not do that, but the good news is i now can have a ""staple hour"" once i get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&#x200b;

tldr: i have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought i was on drugs when it became a problem.

edit: 

thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! i am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. if you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, i just ask that you dm me/name the throwaway so i can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people's perspectives on my problem.

1. i went to see a therapist today with my wife. i was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, i do need help. i am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. just tailored to my specific issue.

2. apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. that included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. so after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. my wife initially thought i was having an affair. she didn't think i was doing drugs until she got the pictures. the pi just told her what he saw, and she deduced that i had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. she admitted that she didn't think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. i do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. i am just an addict, and an idiot. i know how stupid the addiction is and so i tried to hide it. it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things i guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control.",4
"tifu by sending my wife a random dick pic. so this afternoon my wife was out at the pharmacy that's less than three minutes from our house.  she called because our insurance card wasn't working and asked for the numbers on the new cards we had just been issued. i started to read the numbers to her but she interrupted saying it would just be easier if i took a picture. to be funny i included my man parts in the photograph.  when she got home, i asked her how she liked the picture i had sent. she seemed genuinely clueless and didnt know what i was talking about.  apparently she just handed the phone with the picture open to the pharmacist to grab the numbers off himself. 

tl;dr: sent my wife a dick pic with insurance info that she  subsequently showed to the pharmacist at our local grocery store.  ",4
"by destroying the entirety of my family for only $99. throwaway account.

we've all been seeing the recent craze of dna testing and whatnot, so my dad and i decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. we got our results back a few days ago and i went into the dna relatives section to check out my matches. at the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% dna with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. this didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. my cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. we're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

i couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what i was seeing and i had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. the only realistic explanation for what i was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. all the dots lined up and i felt a sense of *loss*. i sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then i had a feeling of anger come over me. i needed some fucking answers. 

without even thinking, i rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. my mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. she had no idea my dad and i had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. my mother and i never had a 'traditional' relationship. she was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

my irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. i asked her if she cheated on dad with uncle david (name changed for obv reasons). i have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. she looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""what kind of question is this? of course not."" i told her everything; the test, percentages, dna matches, all of it!! shit hit the fan. my mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

i left her there and went back into my room. i called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. she ended the call screaming. dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. i told him everything too. he didn't say anything after calming down. he left the room and i locked the door. 

for the next few hours, i heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. my parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. my aunt in law and david showed up shortly later and i'm pretty sure i heard my dad and david get into some physical fight. utter chaos. 

i feel like fucking shit. ik it's not my fault but i can't help feeling that this is all because of me. if i had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. i'm too scared to go outside. i don't even know what the outcome was. the only noise i hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and i sure my dad is out of the house. fuck my life

tldr; mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. i take a dna test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. i've locked myself in my room and i'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

"by leaving thc chocolate out and sending my mom into orbit on edibles. my cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of thc chocolate for christmas, because he'd mentioned that maaaaaybe he'd want to get high. my parents are 75-year old republicans. that was a big maybe.

&#x200b;

well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. you put half a candy bar down and yoink, gone when you come back.

&#x200b;

you can guess what happened. my mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. her last words, high as a kite, were ""i think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&#x200b;

they took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. at which point i assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the redbull orbit jumper.

&#x200b;

anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. so now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.

obligatory gold edit: thanks all for your well wishes! ! a few things to clear up - mom went into the hospital on saturday. as of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in manhattan where she awaits surgery details. i'm in canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but i'm planning to head back down to ny this weekend to be with her. also....op is not a dude. :)

second update from my dad: mom's surgery may be thursday, with the holidays and all. i decided not to mention that i put the story on the internet.

fp edit - thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. i'm headed back to the states on thursday, the tentative surgery date. will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

update - mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. all of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

check out my adorable mom

"by saying i was tired to my wife.. came home from the gym. its leg day. had full day at work too. work isn't bad. came home to happy kids. wife does a great job at keeping them alive. the best. had to take a shower before bed. wife says hurry because shes tired. i empathize by saying i will hurry because i am also tired. bad idea. wife proceeds to tell me how she is the most tired because of kids. i do not dispute this since i am not a total moron. kids are exhausting but totally worth it. i tell her as much. she is most tired. i am only kind of tired. not good enough. she is more tired. i agree with this in order to ease the tension. unsuccessful. she is fully triggered by the fact that i had the audacity to say that i was tired. there is no escape. am screwed. 


tldr: am not allowed to be tired. ever.

edit: wow. that's a lot of comments and stuff. thanks, reddit. this weekend i will celebrate with a nap! cheers! what makes this cool is that i wrote it while pooping before bed. cant wait to tell my wife!

"by being too horny to notice something had gone horribly wrong. nsfw. well, this didn't happen today. but it's a funny story that i couldn't share with reddit at the time.

rewind back to me at 14 years old. awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. 

as such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing ""boobs"" and ""butts in thongs"" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. 

one night, to avoid watching tv with my dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, i claimed that i had ""homework"" to do. of course, this was a lie. i just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. 

so i fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.

now this is where things went wrong. i got horny and forgot the layout of my house.

you see, my bedroom was upstairs and i had no door. a sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my dad, his wife, and her two kids were watching tv. 

the desktop was right next to the staircase, but i figured that the tv was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. i was right.

but what i didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. 

i also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. 

i eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.

and that's when i turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that i was casting a giant shadow puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. a perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. and i had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.

so i did what anyone would do in that situation. i put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until i heard the tv come back on. then i went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. 

no one ever brought it up. and i'm thankful. but i know what they saw. and i'm still cringing.

tl;dr: got horny. got stupid. projected a masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. still embarrassed.

edit: well shit. glad yall are enjoying this funny little moment. 14 year old me would me mortified.

edit: holy fuck lmao. i'm proud and ashamed of how much yall liked this.",4
"by ruining a joke my wife has been saving for years.. tomorrow i'll be turning 32.  as we were waking up this morning she asked me if i was excited for the plans we'd made for my birthday. i responded that it was going to be tough to do everything in half a minute, but i was looking forward to it nonetheless.

she looked at me, blank-faced for a couple seconds. i thought she was just trying to make sense of what i had said. instead she suddenly smacks my chest and yells at me that i ruined a joke she's been holding onto for years. i didn't believe her until she showed me an email from 2016 that she had sent to herself to remind her to set a calendar event so she wouldn't forget. 

it took her ten minutes before she was calm enough to talk to me again. unfortunately for her i've known and used the 30-second birthday joke for years.

made a stupid joke to my wife about my 32nd birthday only being 30 seconds long and found out she's been saving this joke to use for the past three years. oops.

edit: i'm honestly surprised that i have to say this, but this was all in good fun. my wife is fucking awesome and probably one of the chillest, low-maintenance people i've ever known.  we have been laughing about this all day. the number of reddit relationship therapists showing up to tell me about my unhealthy relationship is staggering.",4
"by explaining my synesthesia to my boyfriend. i have grapheme-color synesthesia. basically i see letters and numbers in colors. the letter 'e' being green for example. a couple months ago i was explaining it to my boyfriend who's a bit of a skeptic. he asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. since then he'll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what i said a few months ago. always being the sameish as course. he still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe i just memeroized them really really well.

tonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. i tried explaining to him i just see the colors automatically when i visualize the letters in my head. i asked him what colour are the letters in his head. he looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in ""my head, that's not a thing"" 

my boyfriend didnt understand what i meant by visualizing the letters. he didn't believe me that i can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. 

turns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. when he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. he can't picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. he thought it was just an expression to say ""picture this"" or etc... its crazy to him the fact that i can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.

now i have a boyfriend that is really upset. he feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. he's been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing i wasnt pulling his chain. hes pretty upset and i feel really bad. 

tldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (cant visualize anything at all)

edit; oh wow this blew up. i just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn't being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. he never thought i was lying. i think it's one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it's way harder when you have aphantasia.",4

"by falling asleep in the back of my boyfriend's car. last summer. we're on a road trip from new mexico to mexico. we have a honda element converted for living in, so i crawl in the back to nap while he's driving. he stops at a gas station in the desert of arizona and while he's pumping, i get out to use the bathroom. come back out, don't see him, and walk around the parking lot to have a look. i jokingly think to myself that maybe he drove off not knowing that i got out to use the restroom, but brush that off. i sit on a bench outside twiddling my thumbs, realizing this may now actually be the case. i reach for my phone to call him, but of course my phone is in the car.

i go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don't have one. obviously they do, but whatever. so i start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we're in the middle of nowhere and they think i'll steal it i guess. i go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. i realize i don't know my boyfriends number by heart so i just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he'll answer. he doesn't. i use one person's phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend's number, but alas, his phone is dead when i call.

i resort to explaining to everyone whose phone i ask to use my situation. some don't believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and i was just being modest. it's been about 2 hours now. the store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, i'm still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.

a cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. i explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. she tells me i can't stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. i ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. we're driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he's at the gas station and there's a guy there looking for his girlfriend. i just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. and there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn't believe he'd actually done that. 

he said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized i wasn't in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he's ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. and that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. he thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. 

edit: i understand ifu by not relaying my need to pee.
also that it all sounds really stupid objectively and in retrospect, but it makes sense how things happened at the time. also have never heard of this last man on earth episode until now, so that's pretty funny. i have many a text message/facebook post to prove this happened irl.

"by not washing under my foreskin for the first 15 years of my life. this is long so tldr at the bottom.

this happened around 6 years ago when i was in 9th grade. i grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. my parents never taught me anything about genitals and i apparently never asked, all i knew was that's where the pee came out.

so one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. i was pretty shocked because that's certainly not how mine worked. by that time i was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

so armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work i went home and a few google searches led me to discover that i had a severe case of phimosis. so being the pragmatic young buck that i am i also google how to fix it. there were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel i opted for the latter option. i got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom's bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

after about 4 hours of stretching i finally started making some progress! i could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell i've ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. it dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. i kept stretching over the course of a few days and i started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as i stretched. some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as dick cheese. 

i cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. that was about to change real fucking fast.

so this was about 10 days into my stretching and i'd gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. i was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so i got very impatient and i decided i'd try to force it all the way back that day i lubed and got to work, i pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. i pulled it till i couldn't bear the pain anymore. i did this over and over again for around 3 hours until i somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. i got way too excited and despite the pain i gave it one big yank and i felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. it hurt like hell but i was just so relieved that i didn't care. i opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. the entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. that was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where i tore the top part of my foreskin when i yanked it over the glans. i freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. it eventually stopped and then i had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. i eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. i was still hurting but i was finally done. i got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. i thought that was it. i tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn't budge so i just left it.i completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. you know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? that's how my penis looked. i went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

when i got home i was still in major pain so i decided i'd check on it. i undressed in the shower and looked down at it. the first thing i saw were the blisters. two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. the next thing i noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. i'm a black guy.

i realized that if i didn't find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. i lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. this was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. i kept trying to force it back over and i put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  my penis was on fire at this point and i was holding back tears but i kept pushing until i felt it pop back over the glans. judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain i felt i guess the second blister popped too. once again i left it and fucking went to bed. 

i checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. i rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks i was pretty much ok. my foreskin was still tight and i do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. even if they aren't as stupid as i was don't take that risk lol

tl;dr; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because i got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn't get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. 

edit: so i didn't expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! 

so while i'm happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, i'd like to clear up something. this post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  rather, i'd like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. 

for those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. don't be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. they have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. for those of you who aren't old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. believe me it's not as awkward that you think. don't risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like.

"by c*mming so hard i fainted. so this happened a couple of days ago..

had a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. after changing back to my old wash and my rash didn't showing any indication of subsiding, i went to visit a dermatologist. anyways, turns out i have a skin condition called pityriasis rosea, which isn't actually serious and should go away on its own. so she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. after showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and i sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. i noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scratching my back reaalllyyy good. so naturally i took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. naturaly i decided to take it to the next logical level: flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (yes i know this sounds mildy retarded). what ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. i busted a nut so hard i started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and i fucking fainted. my parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a reaaal worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. so yeah, my mother hasn't looked me in the eye for like 2 days. fml

tl;dr: found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided i wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. came so hard i went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.

i'm legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol

"by tipping my pizza delivery driver $1100. so today i sold my bitcoin i bought 2 years ago i spent like $100 on the investment or something, i cashed it out at a bitcoin atm and brought it home the first thing i did to celebrate was buy some edibles. i buy some edibles eat a whole brownie and am out of it, i order some pizza and take some money from my wad and put it in a pile on the table next to me total was like 20 so i put 23.

since i'm high af the pizza delivery girl knocks i grab the wad of all the money not the $23 stack. i give it to her and she starts crying she keeps saying are you sure you dont know how much this is going to help me. freaked out and high i say okay and just rush inside.

right now after waking up being passed out i realize what i've done, gave away my bill money for this month lol.

tl;dr - i tipped my pizza delivery driver $1100 while high on brownie edibles by accident and have no money to pay for my bills now

edit: thanks for all the nice comments and the reddit gold kind stranger. i just woke up and this post just blew up. i could never call the pizza place and ask for the money back, with how happy it made the women and the fact it was my own dumb mistake it just wouldn't feel right in my head, i would rather be late on my bills and figure anything else out then do that.

"i hooked up with a guy in my airport hotel room this morning before checking out. turns out he is on the same flight as me and guess what, he's traveling with his wife and kids.. i know reddit is going to give me a lot of hate for this. this morning i was super horny and really wanted hook up with a local guy to give him bj. so i got to talking with a guy and even though he was a lot older (like late 30s-mid 40s), he had a great bod and a great dick. so i said what the hell and invited him to my hotel room. after 45min to an hour of fun, i thought i'd never see this dude again because i'm flying home this afternoon (right now).

wrong. i went to the gate when they started boarding. guess who was pre-boarding with his wife and children? you guessed it. to make matters worse, they are just a couple rows from me and i can hear all their conversations. i'm in the plane right now and he keeps texting. i am saving screen shots in case i need them in the future. i'm sitting here wondering how he was able to get away from his family that long...he was staying at the same hotel, which now just dawned on me because he made it to my room super fast. 

this is so uncomfortable.

tl;dr: hooked up with a guy at my airport hotel this am. turns out he's married, and he and his family are on my flight home.

edit: i gave him my phone number for trading texts and pics early this am. he texted me just now telling me he found me on ig and fb so he must have searched with my phone number somehow. now i definitely need leverage with the screen shots to tell him to stop contacting me.

edit 2: a) i'm male. b) the wife does not know. he texted me in the plane asking me to keep quiet. and then also wanted to stay in touch and text me later because he now knows we live in the same city (and yes you bet i saved the screen shot - saved it on the phone, on the cloud, on emails to myself) c) i knew what his dick looked like because of dick picks and bathroom mirror selfies

just wanted to respond to popular questions.

"by not taking off my apple watch or disabling the 911 feature and accidentally called police while i was handcuffed and being spanked by my husband and the police heard me screaming.. to begin, i'm a female bdsm practitioner. i enjoy it, and i won't apologize. (edit: that came out harsh. i'm sorry)

my husband often cuffs and whips me, and on wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. he put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my apple watch. i didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. 

so we get into it, and he's spanking me and i'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly i hear from my watch ""ma'am, i hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. we are sending someone to you. hold tight."" 

""did you call 911???"" my husband asked, ""tell them it was an accident!!""

so i tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name she said my name here? and i say yes... and she says ""we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

i said okay thank you, and i hung up.

""the police are coming.""

shit. i'm literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. within a few minutes there's a stern knock at the door. we put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.

i calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. i didn't mention the spanking.

apparently my husband did. another police officer comes in and asks about our bdsm contract. ""he told you about our contract?""

""he felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show state of mind.""

i go get our contract and showed it to the officers. after a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the apple watch if we're going to do that again.

tl;dr by accidentally calling 911 during a heavy bdsm session and they heard me screaming and sent the police.

edit: iwatch doesn't exist. <3

edit: this post is not deja vu. yes. i posted it 2 days ago, and mods took it down, asking me to repost it today. the literally hundreds of people asking about if they saw this before need to read this edit. they took it down because this happened on wednesday, and according to the rules of the subreddit, sexual content is not allowed except for on weekend, so they asked me to repost it today.

edit: holy shit. thanks for the gold!! and the front page. i'm freaking out a little because contrary to the trolls, yes this happened.",4
"by texting my pregnant wife that ""this isn't working"". my wife posted earlier today on la about this. not using my main because my fil knows it and i'm not quite ready to tell him about this.

i went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. i had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when i turned it on. most of them were asking how i could do this. i had no clue what she was talking about. she didn't answer any of my calls back.

i got home and she was packing up to leave. i'll admit it, i cried. a lot. had no clue what was happening or what i did. finally, it comes out that i texted her that i wanted a divorce. she showed me the text and i immediately realize what happened.

this morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. i texted her ""the new mirror came in! i'm going to try to put it together but i may need your help later"". i had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. i texted her, ""this isn't working, and at this point i think i need to just give up"". apparently, the first text didn't go through, just the second one. so my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while i was off thinking everything was great. she even called a divorce lawyer.

things are fine now but she's still crying off and on. she told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.

tl;dr accidentally told my wife that things weren't working, she almost left me.

edit: wow, this blew up. to address a few things that came up in the comments:

\-i usually work from home unless i need to meet with clients. i don't always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she's usually at work anyway. that's why she didn't know i was at work yesterday. i'm not allowed to have my phone on at work until my wife is 30 weeks. if my phone goes off, i could lose my job, and our health insurance.

\-my wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. that's why she had the reaction she did.

\-my comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. neither of us is mad at the other. this was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. we're fine. i posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. no need to psychoanalyze my wife or pm me about divorce. we are fine.

\-and no, we haven't put the mirror together yet. we weren't really in a ""home improvement"" mood last night.",4
"by giving my boyfriend head without locking the door. throwaway account because obviously.

my boyfriend and i are staying at his parents house for a few days for the holidays. we got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. we're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. i started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so i figured on going to completion. unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.

so there i am on my knees, arms holding onto his sides, bobbing my head in a mad dash, getting excited from how close he is and then suddenly the door opens. his mom comes in! i freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. 

anyways, it's 5:40am, i've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.

tl;dr: bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.

update @7:31am - thanks for all the reassuring comments. my bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. more to come.

update @8:38am - of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... anyways thanks! so breakfast started off totally fine. i mean, yeah i was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. that is, until i excused myself to go shower. she stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. but then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being ""safe"". it was sweet and cringy all at once. i guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) 

anyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!

update: a lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. actually i assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); i didn't actually see her do it. i asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while i was...ehm...cleaning.",4
"by realizing that my ceiling fan has been making my bedroom a sauna for 11 years. i've been living in this house for the past 11 years. in my bedroom there's a ceiling fan that i always have on to try and make my room colder. my room has always been insanely hot compared to the rest of the house and i never understood why.

flash forward to today when i'm talking to a friend that said they found out their fan can switch directions to heat the room in the winter. i immediately realized my fuck up. when i got home i took a closer look at the fan and hiding by the light is a little black switch. i hit the switch and what do you know, my room is about 10 degrees colder in minutes. i've been sleeping in a sauna for the past 11 years and had no idea. every day in the summer waking up sweaty was because of a tiny black switch.

"by taking lsd and pretending to be french for 10 months. throwaway for reasons.
tl;dr at the bottom.

so this was more of a fu that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

about 11 months ago i moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until i could get the money together to sort something out properly, i was hoping to have already moved out by this point. on my second day after i'd finished unpacking i decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, i'd brought some with me that i'd recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and i quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than i had been told they were, and i thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn't helping me relax. so i figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because i was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

so i left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. it's a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door's door is about one meter away from mine. i'd not met anybody on my street yet and didn't realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. she said something along the lines of ""hello nice to meet you, my name's (her name), are you new to the area?""

so basically i do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where i pretend i can't speak english. i remember a few words from my gcse french so i just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. in the state i was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and french just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. my exact words were ""je voudrais une boulangerie"" (one of my favourite lines to use) and i shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. she pretty much just left me to it after that and i got on my way. i did my walk and got home about two hours later, i was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. when i got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. i tried to keep my head down because i couldn't handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said ""bonjour"", so i instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. when i got in i started freaking out straight away because i realised that i'd just become french and now two of the neighbours think i can't speak any english. the next day when i woke up i realised the best thing i could do (as an englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be french for seemingly no reason. 

fast forward 10 months, i still live here, and at this point i'm in deep. my life on this street is a web of lies. i've perfected my french accent and over the course of 10 months french me has learnt a decent amount of english so he can hold disjointed conversation.
i'd gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and i was the nice quirky french guy on the street. i didn't let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation i had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered i wasn't french. if i had friends come over (i don't have many so it wasn't too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. most of them found it amusing, at least. 

things were going okay and i wasn't too worried about being exposed anymore because i'd gotten so used to it. i'm not home that much and when i am i rarely leave the house for any reason so i only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when i was out on my street. if anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when i got to take on my french persona. french me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his english was a bit limited.

but then there was the day it all came crashing down. i was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her i didn't recognise. she stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend ""this is f7tj78, the guy i was telling you about"". you might be able to see where this is going. 

her friend hits me with a question in french that i didn't understand a word of, and i knew he was actually french straight away because his accent was way better than mine. i didn't know what to do and i just froze. every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause i just decided i had to come clean. i told her i wasn't actually french and couldn't speak french and then i tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke i'd been doing on everyone. nobody was buying that. i fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

i haven't spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which i'd  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. i make sure nobody is around now whenever i leave the house, and i do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when i get home so that i never come into contact with them. every time i think about the day i was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

tl;dr: pretended to be french to avoid human interaction on lsd, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a french man.

edit: i didn't think this post was going to catch much attention, and i'm praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. some people seem to have a hard time believing that i thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, i'd like to remind people that when i made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",4
"by making my boyfriend a tinder account. okay so necessary this actually happened in the last couple of weeks. basically my boyfriend suffers from pretty low self esteem, like it's not like he's too bothered about his looks but he rates himself a 5 out of 10 at best. 

obviously i think he's gorgeous and handsome but even though i've been saying this for years, he does not believe me. so, for some stupid reason, i decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. i set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. 

after a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after i showed this to him, i saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. 

queue my surprise when a couple of days later i check the tinder account i had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and i could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. 

i confronted him and he denied it but i mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity i checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. so now the tinder i made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool

tl;dr: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with

edit: wow i did not expect this to blow up! thank you so much for the gold and silver and for your kind, kind words. it honestly touches me how absolutely lovely thousands of strangers can be. 

also, if anyone needs help with their tinder, hmu lol because i'm apparently pretty good at it.

"by telling a stranger i can't wait to fuck them tonight. disclaimer- this happened at least 6 years ago and was deeply repressed by shame. i only remembered it in a conversation with my wife when she asked, ""what was your most embarrassing moment?""

so i was at a work party, and my gf at the time (not currently my wife) offered to pick me up and drive me home, knowing i would get fully sloshed at the party. she was right.

on the way home, i ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. she pulls her light blue jeep into the parking lot, i stumble out of the jeep, go in, and complete my purchase. 

i (over aggressively) yank open the passengers door to the blue jeep, plop myself down on the seat, and say to my gf. ""i can't wait to get home and fuck the shit out of you.""

i was not expecting to get hit in the face. i also did not expect the loudest goddamn screaming i've ever heard in my life. instinctively, i covered up my face and wondered what the hell i said wrong, as it was not uncommon for either of us to say something like that to each other. 

the screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so i couldn't really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when i heard, clear as a bell, ""you fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.""

whoa whoa whoa instant sobriety. i uncovered my face and looked up, finally dawning on me that although i was in a blue jeep, it was not my gfs blue jeep. my gfs identical blue jeep was parked next to- and blocked by- this random woman's blue jeep. 

i finally tumbled out of the car, went to my gfs car, and told her what happened. she convinced the woman not to call the police to tell them about some crazy guy breaking into her car and telling her he was gonna fuck her. 

i did not fuck anyone that night. 

tl;dr: drunkenly got into the wrong car, assumed the driver was my gf, and told her i was going to fuck her",4
"by matching with my homophobic uncle on grindr. so i have an uncle (we will call him j) who has always been very vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. there is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.

well this weekend in between family gatherings i was looking to meet somebody . i started chatting with an older man because that's how i roll. a lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so i don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. we actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics i wish i could unsee and sending a few i wish i could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.

so i'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . it is at this moment i realize my fu, i've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  he tried to play it off like a random encounter but i wasn't letting him get away with that. after some pressing he finally admits that he is the man i've been talking to and i told him i don't judge him like he does me . he apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years 

he kept talking with me like he was still interested and i had to make it clear that was not going to happen . i had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him i had to go ahead and block his number. i can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.

always get a face pic, people.

tl:dr: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . should have insisted on the face pic

edit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but i'll answer some pressing questions . i did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who i was . it is pretty disturbing to say the least. as far as blackmail goes i have everything saved but i don't plan on doing anything with it as i think that could actually put me in danger . this man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.

"by sending a video without watching it and now i am being adopted.  so last thursday night i saw everyone tagging their step dads in the budweiser commercial. without watching it, i sent it to my stepdad. about an hour later my step dad and mom call me and ask if i'm hinting at something. my step dad is like i know you had intent. i'm like huh??? omg in the commercial the adult children are asking their stepdads to adopt them. so he starts crying, thinking i want this. now i can't tell him that i didn't mean to. friday he squeezed me so tight and said he wants me take his name and make it official. etc etc. all i can think is wow that sounds like a huge hassle. but i can never say anything about it being an accident. so like now i'm being adopted and changing my name.

"by making my wife think i killed myself. right off the bat i want to say that i am in no way shape or form making light of suicide. this was not a prank gone wrong, or something i did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. burner for reasons.

&#x200b;

this happened a couple of weeks ago. i tripped and sprained my ankle. it's been bothering me enough that i've been taking epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. in addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, i also find it incredibly relaxing. say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, i enjoy a good soak.

&#x200b;

i also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. it's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...i call them old man spots. they're harmless, and most of the time i don't even notice, but every once in a while...i'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. additionally it takes foreverrr to get the bleeding to stop...its not like i can elevate my balls, let alone put a band aid on...

&#x200b;

well...on the day in question, i get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. so, i get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. it's not really important how i did it, but i ended up nicking one of those spots. so, after cursing a reasonable amount, i start the lengthy ritual of holding tp against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. even after the bleeding stops i have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...well i finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. i put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...

&#x200b;

 i wasn't asleep but i was really zoned out and relaxed...until i was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. i've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. it scared the shit out of me, and i jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. i shouted ""honey? what the fuck!""  she didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  it took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting ""jesus christ!"".....i could see what it must look like to her... i had apparently not stopped the bleeding as well as i thought i had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.

&#x200b;

it took me a long time to calm her down, and i don't think that's something you just get over. hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though i thought i had. took a bath, zoned out. wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact i was bleeding into the water and thought that i had killed myself. sorry honey.

"by relaxing too much during a sensual massage. bit of back story. i started talking to a guy on reddit last week. we hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. we decided to meet for a date on friday. i have ibs and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. i was also very tired.

the fu: so i'm at this guy's house and i've made us a very nice mac n cheese. there was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. we're then snuggling on the sofa and i feel a big fart brewing. i'm hoping i can just absorb it back in to my body if i hold on to it long enough. 

we start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. i choose a 'relaxing' oil. i'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. he starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. i'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.

i then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart i have ever expelled. the fart i was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. it was hella loud and it was hella long. and it was right on his balls. it was so forceful, they vibrated.

his response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'at least you didn't shit yourself'.

tldr: farted on a first date's balls.

edit: for anybody interested, the mac n cheese is a very tasty recipe for those on a fodmap diet. you can replace pretty much all elements for low fodmap alternatives - gluten free pasta, lactofree milk and cheese, asafoetida for onion and garlic oil for garlic!",4
"a marriage.  obligatory this didn't happen today, but a couple of weeks ago.

 so i sometimes drive for ride share companies to make extra cash and keep me off of the couch. i live in a touristy area that booms during summer months and vacation rental homes are common... so common that i sometimes do pick-ups and drop-offs at the same homes for different people week to week and family/friend groups of people renting the homes are the norm.

 one particular day i dropped a guy off at a beautiful home near the beach, that i had picked a guy up from just an hour or two prior. so as we arrive i mention this to the rider:

me - hey i just picked one of your buddys up from here about an hour ago

rider- no, must be the wrong house

me- nope, he walked right out of that side door. i dropped him off at *names local bar* his girlfriend is still in there though, she stayed behind. (i had seen her kiss him goodbye at the door, but didn't mention this to the rider) you guys having a family/friend vacation?

rider- this is a family owned home, it's been in my family for years and we don't rent it out. nobody lives here but me and my wife and i've been in ny for work for the past 4 days. 

awkward silence as we both come to the realization. 

he got out and i drove away scolding myself for having such a big mouth. 

tldr- i may have ruined a marriage by trying to make small talk with my big mouth

* edit- thanks for all of the support guys! i know i did nothing wrong, i just hate being involved in other people's businesses, especially when it's so negative. 

 also - thanks for the silver and platinum awards!",4
"by stumbling on my 19 y/o sons reddit and reading through it.. dear lord. on my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so i clicked the user name and looked through the profile.  i click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

this is my sons account. it has to be. the comment he posted is about something that happened while i was there. he had a more detailed post about that specific day. he had another previous post about an event in his life i knew about and knew some details about. he had a few other posts which i also read. 

i now know what gets him going sexually. not something i needed to know.

i know what his girlfriend likes sexually. also, not something i needed to know. also quite surprising. 

i know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. i feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

i know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife's room.

in reading through the comments he's made to others, i've learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. i feel very proud about that.

overall, i wish i never clicked that first comment. i know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.

tl;dr. accidentally discovered my son on reddit. found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room.

**edited to add: yes, i shouldn't have read all of it. and some posts i stayed away from. and honestly, i didn't realize it right-right away. the first post i read sounded like him, but there are millions of redditors. it was after another that i really put the pieces together. and yeah, their might be some hypocrisy about being slightly mad about him snooping through my room. but hey, life isn't always fair. i also have no intention of tell him, or anyone else anything i read.**",4
"by having the worst sex of my life with a complete stranger and then meeting her mom right afterwards. this actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. in 2016 i started using tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. i had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. my profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of ""not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices"" and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. 

fast forward to march of 2017 and i matched with someone. after a couple of one-off messages that don't really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. a couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. this all sounds great. except for two problems.

the first problem is that i have a beard in all of my photos. and even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. my facial hair is like if someone shaved a guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. if i grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. wiry and sparse. it's not good. for six years, i'd still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. but for some reason, the week before we started talking, i had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. i just wanted to know what it looked like. the answer? not. fucking. good. at this point, i was 27 but still looked young for my age. shave the beard off and i look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. really fucking awkward.

so i pulled up to her house and text before i got out of my car to say, ""hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it's just me."" luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as i expected. all good so far.

i went inside and we end up hanging out all night. she cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. she was blown away by the fact that i'd never seen labyrinth and demanded we watch it. we ended up watching three movies that night. for labyrinth, i was about five feet away on the couch. for young frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. for the third movie (which i can't remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. and this is where the second problem comes in. 

after my breakup in 2016 and realizing i'd been battling lifelong depression, i started taking antidepressants. one of the super fun side effects of ssris is that it can be really hard to climax. like, try as you might, nothin. dust. moths. nothin. thanks, big pharma.

and so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like ""holy fuck i might have a heart attack. why are my ears ringing so loudly?"" and ""what about this position?"" ""ouch!"" ""oh my god, i need a towel. so. much. sweat. i can't see."" we were in the basement on a large three piece couch. you know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. well at one point i tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. a bruised ass. a bent dick. a lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. 

if this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven't done any cardio in your fucking life. and jesus christ the sweat. so fucking slippery and gross. this wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. this is bog monsters come to life sweat. this is ace ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. at one point our chests become suction cupped together. i could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn't felt like it was going to explode. and the chafing. fuck. no matter how ready either of y'all are when you start out, after two hours, it's gonna wear off. we both felt like we'd attacked our bits with sandpaper. my poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. this was no climactic movie sex scene. this was a john waters film come to life. 

well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. it's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. we went outside for a smoke and at this point it's about 6am. i'm wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she's only in a bathrobe. we sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (she had just moved back home before finding a new place). so not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now i get to meet her mom for the first time! great! i'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. life is fucking weird.

well, the reason i am posting this on march 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we're engaged to be married on march 14th of 2020. our sex life is far better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. i mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. 

tl;dr i met up with a tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. now we're engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.




edit: just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! i am still wholly undecided if i will ever show her this post. it's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. we'll see though. and thank you so much for the gold and silver! did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. and for those asking, i've changed my dosage on my ssri and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! and also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. he didn't pan out. within three months, her mom got hit up by several tinder guys claiming to be part of the ""oil business"" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. tinder can be amazing and terrifying...

edit2: i guess now i probably have to show this to my fiancee to which she will reply, ""i have no idea what any of that means. good for you, i guess?"" i still love her.

edit3: a few of y'all keep asking, ""why in tifu?"" well, let me tell ya, if i had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. even worse than my breakup the year before. not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? yeah, that sucked. just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't suck asssss on the whole. i mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. thanks for coming to my tedtalk

final edit: for real y'all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations. i told her about this post when i got home from work today and she cracked the fuck up when i read it to her. we spent the night repeating history (minus the horrible sex) by watching labyrinth in the driveway with a make-shift drive-thru theater setup",4
"by accidentally asking my wife's sister for a three way.. this fuck up mainly involves three people me m32, my wife f27 and her sister f25.

so for context a normal saturday is for my wife and i to drop our kids off at her mothers house and go back to ours for some ""good times"" and maybe a film, games or meal etc.

this week however is ""time of the month"" as she puts it so anything sexual is off. 

so off we go to drop off our kids, when we arrive we are greeted by her mother and by chance her sister who happens to be staying there over the weekend. 

now obviously sisters talk and these two talk a lot so her sister knows what we normally do on our saturdays.

as we are about to leave her sister says ""have fun"" in a cheeky way which i completely don't pick up on.

my brain decides that as my wife and i spent thursday together for valentines and today we are just going to chillout, play some games and watch a film coupled with the fact they don't get to spend much time together anymore it would be a great idea to invight the sister along to chill out.

so straight after the ""have fun"" and without consulting my wife, i say ""you can tag along if you like""

the atmosphere drops like a lead balloon and silence descends upon the scene and i'm still there like...   ""what?"" my brain still not connecting the dots  so i double up the fuck ups by breaking the silence with. ""as you said it will be fun"".

my wife's face turns from confused and embarrassed to that look she gives me when i've done something very very wrong and the sister just looks stunned!

still didn't connect the dots until she explained in the car on the ride home.

i've apologised and explained. i know we will laugh about it later but for now i'm playing lego lotr on my own. 

tl:dr i asked my wife's sister for a three way without realising sisters talk about the things they do.

edit: well this post went nuclear! oh and thanks for the golds kind strangers. 

a couple of things i'd like to address, many of you seem to think its bad we don't spend saturday with our kids. well i work from home 4 days a week and my wife is a stay at home mom. our kids are not yet school age so it's nice for us to have time as a couple on a saturday.

yes, i spelt invite as invight, oh well.

as for an update, lego lotr is now being played two player!

thanks all.",4
"by not telling my wife our son was coming home. this happened sunday night.



my oldest son is in the marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  he took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  at first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. when it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  i tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  



i get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  he gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his dress blues.  now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.



we discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  we go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  we settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... free internet points and all that......



i walk in and the house is quiet.  no one in the living room.  a little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......



what i did not know was the entire time i was gone, my wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  she got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her ""fuck me"" lingerie.



so no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to surprise her.  a handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  the text told my son to stay outside.  i had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  



so my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  i told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  the look of confusion on her face was priceless.  it took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, there was our son in his dress uniform and she was estatic.  the noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  it goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess will have to suffice instead.




tl;dr  didn't tell wife that marine son was coming home, missed out on sexy times and the second half of the packers/falcons game



edit 1: goldx2? wow thank you guys.  this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.

update: wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit.  have been reading some of the comments to her this morning.  she is worried that this story will end up in one of her marine moms fb groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol.    son wants to take his siblings out for ice cream and the new lego movie, cross your fingers people.

"by scatmanning a girl i was dating. 
so quite recently i've been listening to the song ""scatman"", which for the uninitiated is a dope song of a dude scatting which kinda goes like ""scatdobiddlybiddlygiddlydiddlybiddlydiddly...""  and then he says ""i'm the scatman!"".

so i couldn't get this song out of my head for the past couple days and i was always queuing it up on spotify. 

long story short a girl i've been dating came over last night and my brain didn't override my stupidity when i decided to add scatman to my sexytime playlist. 

when she came over it was pretty much 'prepare for battlestations' from the first minute, so i put the sexytime playlist on shuffle. it started off well with some song from the mezzanine album, and then one i can't remember and then a jazzy one. by this point i was just beginning to go down on her. 

this is where i fucked up. the scatman song came up next after the relaxing jazz and it was so fucking jarring. 

i guess a normal person would've stopped and skipped the song. i really regret not doing that now. 

instead of that, without skipping a fucking beat, i started to use my tongue and went down on her at the same exact pace as the dude in the song was scatting. it was so fast that i had to concentrate hard to get the timing right. i know it probably was bad technique, but i started and i had to commit.  
it was probably 9 seconds of doing that before i stopped and came up. i looked into her eyes and perfectly in time with the song i said ""i'm the scatman"".  

i don't know what expression i expected to see on her, my brain clearly short circuited for me to do that in the first place. what i didn't expect was the look of pure disgust.  

that moment went in pure slow motion for me. my brain pretty much exploded and was like ""ah fuck i can't believe i've done this"" 

i saw no means of recovery so i got up and paused the song. and she said ""can we just hang for a bit instead""  and i agreed. we ended up watching an episode of friends, both of us refusing to acknowledge what just happened. then she said she had to go back to her place.

we've only been dating for 3 weeks and i'm pretty sure i might've totally fucked this up. at least i have a funny story out of it, though i'd much prefer having a girlfriend.

tldr: went down on a girl to the scatman song and now she might turn into a ghost",4
"by sitting in the wrong class for an entire month and finding out a day before the first midterm.. i'm in my third year of university taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. to start the semester i ended up missing the first week of school because i was on a last minute trip with my friends. it was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since i technically couldn't afford to go.

anyway, i came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. on both those days i have classes all day until 2pm so i usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. so my first tuesday home i ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. so as part of my degree i have to take microeconomics which all i knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. when i get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so i just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

this goes on for 3.5 weeks. i came to class. took notes. then did the weekly assignments. on the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is febuary 1st. so the class before the exam, january 30th, i decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. now i was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was all theory based while the class was heavy math based. i understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. i explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*explains above about material*
prof: ""what do you mean theory? all the assignments are filled with math. are you using launchpad?""
me: ""no the assignments are online. like the website we bought the textbook from. whats lauchpad?""
prof: ""pardon? i don't have a textbook for this course.""
me: ""it literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*shows syllabus*
prof: ""wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
me: ""what do you mean...? this is econ 202 right?""
*prof starts laughing*
prof: ""haha this is econ 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. this is a new one, i've never experienced this before.""
me: ""well this is awkward. i better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

i then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. i caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. even showed him my econ 301 notes to prove i couldn't make this shit up. he just laughed and said the same thing ""this is a new one for me."" turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. same with the midterms. they were relevant because it was obviously a level above what i was supposed to be doing and the only thing i got wrong was the building code. they were both classroom 112, just different buildings. so basically i just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. wish me luck tomorrow!

tldr; i was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until i finally realized. then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. crazy coicidences all around.

edit: well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""you made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". the exam is in a couple hours and i will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but i had fun and went to tiesto's birthday in vegas amongst other kool stuff. life goes on.

2. i was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and i had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). so i do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. he did everything on the board and there were online notes but i figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. i highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. it's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. i've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so i'm sure it will turn out fine. it'll be a funny story at grad when i get my ring.

thanks for all the support too. :) making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

edit 2: just got back from the exam.. i didn't crush it but there is no way i didn't pass. it was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. the prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""i usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm i will take the average to make up that first exam."" so all in all i survived and live to fight another day.

just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. i will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. in the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. but somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - cz

"during my first surgery as a 3rd year medical student. 
i'm a third-year medical student on my gynecology clerkship ""assisting"" on a laparoscopic hysterectomy. in this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. if you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. as this was my first laparoscopic surgery, i soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. like many of you, i had no idea this role even existed, but i quickly accepted my new job as 'vagina sealer'. i approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. i placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. after several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  the attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said ""do you know where the vagina is? get that stopper out of her ass!""

thank you for reading. i'll go die now. 

tl;dr  couldn't see under the sterile drapes when placing a rubber stopper in the vagina during surgery and accidentally placed it in the rectum",4
"by letting my girlfriends dad use my laptop nsfw. so today i had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, i'm still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn't make one hell of a story for you all

okay so for a bit of back story i'm 27 and i live with my girlfriend, we've been together for 2 years now and through out that time i've seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they're usually travelling so it's a little harder to spend time with them. now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and i for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. we've also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....

so on top of making porn i'm also an aspiring film editor and i am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but i also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us i'd been editing a new video, usually after editing i go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because i'd always got the vibe they didn't like me very much. we were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, i immediately said sure and led him into the office, now i could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and i kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. so i lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as i opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst i ejaculated on her face, if that's not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

i panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn't want her dad getting us sick also.

her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and i are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but i hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and i'll keep you updated if anything else happens 



tl;dr i unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won't talk to us

update: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so i'll explain, as i said earlier in the post i watch the video post editing to make sure there's no problems before uploading, before going to sleep i just shut the laptop without even thinking, i do this often (i know it's not good but sshh) if you don't stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. still haven't heard from her dad yet. i honestly didn't expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and i laugh a lot so thank you

update 2: thank you all for participating in a social experiment stay tuned",4
"deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.. the update!!(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)

&#x200b;

ohhhhh where do i begin. this happened this weekend.

let's lay out some plot points first..

\-i'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. she is 26.

\-i work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. i've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-i've always worked out, done yoga, i'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. this combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. i've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. i know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, i've done it a lot and i know what i'm doing, lol.

&#x200b;

okay. so, the girl i am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. one of whom is getting married soon. she was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. i was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? i agree to the plan. i was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&#x200b;

there are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. this way, i would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. but the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (i can draw a diagram if needed.)

&#x200b;

so the day comes, i have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. by the time i arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. i prepare myself with the girl i'm dating, and she invites her friends in. they are hooting and hollaring as i'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. the whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, i'm really into this idea now.

&#x200b;

i throw my legs over my head as i've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... i circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. i put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and i hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. i'm trying to look back to see them, but i'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. i start getting more and more into it, and the girl i'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. at this point i'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. the girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&#x200b;

after a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""cum in your mouth! cum in your mouth!""... now to be clear, i normally don't do this. i have before, lol, but it's not my thing. but i'm the entertainment, and i aim to please, so in my mind i'm thinking lets do this. i start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. the girl i'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. the whole thing is so hot and i feel like i'm about to cum, and.....explode. it was a lot. i'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. the girl i'm dating let's go of my legs and i fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - i'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. so i stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and i look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. my assistant.

&#x200b;

she leaves the room, i race to the bathroom. the girl i'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and i tell her. she loses it laughing - ""so and so is your assistant?! ahahahah"". i'm not laughing. assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&#x200b;

it's actually a bit of a scene, the girl i'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling assistant and she is not answering. the girl i'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&#x200b;

i've been working from home all week. i've talked to my assistant via slack and we've said nothing. she is in the office. i can't work from home tomorrow. i don't know what the fuck to do. the girl i'm dating said that assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. i really don't know what the fuck to do.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - i sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. we haven't spoken about it since.

&#x200b;

edit:  the diagram(https://imgur.com/a/rr31ebi)!  i'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  i'm not a turkey, i promise.

edit 2: to clarify, i don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  i think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  the diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until i stood up.  at least this is the logic i am convincing myself of.

edit 3:  i'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl i am dating"" because honestly i wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  i don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

edit 4:  yes, they were staring at my butthole.  i'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. to be honest if,

edit 5:

since everyone is asking, i'll offer my thoughts.  no, i'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  it's my own dick, so i think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  by your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

as for the ""i've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i bring it back to the above statement.  a handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  i think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  but it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  better than jerking off that's for sure.

and yes, i have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

thanks for coming to my ted talk.",4
"by trying to play my dad's didgeridoo.. so my dad has had this didgeridoo in the house since he visited his sister in australia 10+ years ago. my parents wanted to go out for a walk but i decided i'd eaten too much cheese and couldn't be arsed. while they were out the internet went down so i was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when i spotted the didg. i thought to myself in all these years i've never actually tried to play it (it's more of a decoration and i barely take it in when i see it) and maybe it's time. i pick it up and put it to my lips. i felt like i knew what i was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. i take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. i splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. at first i thought it was saliva and ignored it as i had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. it felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. i glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. the second i clock what's happened i feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. i have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. i run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. i urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. i don't think my mouth will ever feel normal again.

tl;dr - thought i could play didgeridoo, inhaled a mouthful of spiders.

edit; woah gold! and front page! ta! glad you all like/hate my story",4
"by starting small talk with a kind little dude on the subway.. yesterday i got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. i squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. i notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where i'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. he looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. as a larger human, 6'3"" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.

though i couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so i decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. as i sat down i thanked him for making room and told him i really appreciated the gesture. we high-fived and in hindsight i should have ended it there.

i noticed he had his backpack with him so i asked how school was that day. he told me it was just alright. then i asked the fatal question, ""do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?"" he let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.

her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. she yelled ""oooo boy!! you told me you finished that yesterday! guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! you, ya little liar!!!"" his head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 

a few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. he looked back at me as they departed, a look that said ""bro, i thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???"" his look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. 

hang in there little buddy! one weekend may seem like an eternity at your age, but time flies! 

&#x200b;

tl;dr- sat down next to a little dude on the subway because he went out of his way to make room for me. asked him about homework and now he cant play his video games for the whole weekend.",4
"by not making the bed and causing my wife's entire family to panic. throwaway because i'm still embarrassed and i don't want anyone to associate the stupidity with me.

for background, i usually make the bed in the mornings, but i didn't yesterday morning because i was running late.

i went to see my dad yesterday but my wife wasn't feeling well so she stayed home. i got back at around 8:30 and couldn't find her anywhere. i checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and i just couldn't find her. her wallet was there so i figured she just went out for a walk, which is normal since we live in a big city that's active into the night. i started getting worried at around 9:30 because she also wasn't answering her phone. i called a few of her friends and asked if they'd seen her but none had. i called her parents and asked them if they knew where she was, which led to them freaking out because no one could find her. my father in law told me to track her phone, so i went into her apple account and it told me that her phone was in our apartment. i turn on the find my iphone sound and start running through the apartment thinking i should call the cops.

i hear the sound coming from our bedroom so i go in and start tearing the room up, when suddenly my wife pops up from the bed and asks me what the hell i'm doing. turns out the small lump that i thought was just a pile of blankets since i didn't make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn't feel well. she sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn't hear me in the apartment.

i had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.

tl;dr i didn't make the bed yesterday morning and then i thought i was about to end up in an episode of svu.",4
"by going down a reddit rabbit hole.. this didn't happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and i bought a new car. i was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.

i came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse reddit while i'm taking care of my business. most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. i can't remember what sub i was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. before i knew it i was reading about ""the donkey show."" yes that one. some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. i wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so i just kept reading.

someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how the donkey show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. midget porn. i thought, ""what the hell, i've never seen this sort of thing before."" so i clicked.

as weird as it sounds, i clicked out of curiosity......i swear. what i saw was exactly what i expected to see. this specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. after a minute or so, i had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub i was in.

i finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. i get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

she was taking a while, so i grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. my wife comes out and gets in the car. immediately she says, ""what the hell is this?"" i put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. on the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com"". i had never had a car with this feature before, so i was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. i knew i was screwed. it felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so i could change what was displayed on the screen.

after about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks i have a thing for little people. before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. all i could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. i'm pretty sure i'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. yay me...

she said to me one day, ""i know you won't leave me for another woman, but i'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

i doubt she will ever let this one go...

tl;dr i went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine.

edit: damn! i fell asleep for 6 hours and woke up to 3 golds, 2 silvers, and a poop, you guys are awesome! i'm glad you got a kick out of my mishap.

edit2: just to clarify, my kids are too young to be able to read what was on the screen and while i was pleading my case, we kept it very g rated.

"by getting google to ban our entire company while on the toilet. **tldr; company uses google accounts that are all connected. i fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the google account, and all associated accounts. everyone in my company is now blocked by google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**

preface, this happened on friday and is still on-going. i've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so i won't be outed since i guarantee someone will read this eventually. i still do not know if i am the culprit, but i am 90% sure that i am. i feel like this is a fireable offence and i will step up and take it if it comes to that. i'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

i work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. we migrated to gmail and other google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. it's safe to say that everyone is using gmail or google in one way or another. now, our gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.

i have a friend who creates android apps on the side. i do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called titanium backup. 

as a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), i buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. after that, i send him an e-mail with the cloned version through gmail with something along the lines of: ""look at this cool app i found on the store, it was completely free! try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. it was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

recently he uploaded a new app and i did the same thing as usual. i was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. i was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. i e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

about an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their google accounts. at the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

one of my colleagues requested help and i went to check it out. it turns out that their account was blocked by google due to tos violations. their google payments account was blocked as well. i thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. we got banned by google, all of us. 

the afternoon was pandemonium. we were all freaking out, our it guys were trying to get a hold of google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. we could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. all our work was shared with google services.

eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. it wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. one of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

anyways, we were all told to go home on friday. i went home and looked this up myself, and i found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the google payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. it bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how i said all our work accounts were connected?

yeah...

so it's been two days now and we've been chatting over skype, no one knows what happened and the it guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that google isn't helping us out. their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. the posts i've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...

so yeah, that's that. i'm 99% sure that i am the culprit who caused this. i do not know why google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but i fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. i might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.

**edit1:** this blew up pretty quickly. luckily, i have 3 pms from people close to, or reps who can help me out. if i missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. i am in touch with one of them now and i am getting in touch with it at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. i will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out.

"by seeing my mother's porn.. my pc sits next to my stepdad's laptop in the living room. my cat likes to jump on the keyboard or the laptop and lay on it. a moment ago, he jumped up onto the keys and the screen lit up showing me to opened photo gallery. i went over and was going to close the application and then shut down the laptop. i was greeted with three distinct photos.

&#x200b;

one- my mother and my stepdad in a threesome. the thing is, the person in the middle was my mother's best friend. i saw her eating out my own mother as my stepdad drilled the other girl.

&#x200b;

two- my mother sucking off my stepdad, in my dad's house. on the counter. where i eat.

&#x200b;

three- more tame, but my stepdad (who is bald) with a decent head of hair. i've never seen him with more than a little fuzz before.

&#x200b;

so i have to face them tomorrow with these images seared into my mind.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - saw my mom's porn. help me god.

edit: my mother woke me up while i was operating on three hours of sleep and ho boy. my stepdad uses reddit. he found this. you fuckers brought me to the front page. this is my first time ever here and my lord, why this post? thanks anyway, even though my life just got a lot worse, now i have 10k virtual clicks!

"by making a joke and losing the right to see my daughter. this just happened last week. i got home from working out of town thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. ""beth"" comes in and i can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. she feels fine though. 

i am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. i wake beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. it is more than half closed and a little red. she still feels fine. as soon as the doctor opens, i call them and they tell us to come in.  

we get there and i go to check in. the receptionist that i have never seen looks at my daughter and says ""oh. my goodness, what happened?""  so i respond as a joke ""eh, she got out of line"".   

i know!  it's horrible. i'm sorry!  i have a weird sense of humor and i'm a bit socially awkward.  anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  soon we are called in. the checkup goes as expected. it's a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter zyrtec or benadryl.  then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. 

he comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. the doctor is angry. we all head to the doctor's office to talk.  

there is a policeman and a policewoman. the policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. my daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  so she says no and buries her face in my side.  the police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. i saw one of beth's cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. the doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. 

the police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. the doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. he just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  i now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  she makes an excuse and leaves the room. he says that he thinks he has to let her go. he says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. he says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. 

the police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if i can come to the station.  a friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. 

we get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   the police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. they say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  i call my wife who goes ballistic.  

the county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if i sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. my uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. i stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that i really don't need to make for this week.  i can't wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but i'm pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  

tl/dr:  made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.  

edit: spelling

edit 2:  update
thank you for the gold kind strangers.
wow this blew up.  i wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  i want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  for those of you saying that i am an idiot, you are probably right.

1) i will not be sleeping on the couch.  my wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  at least not at me.

2) i am heading home from boston tomorrow evening and i think everything should be resolved by then.

3) i will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  she was very young did not do this out of animosity. i do not know what if anything will happen to her job. i am not pushing for her to lose it.  

4) the other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  a few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  these lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  the receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   the dep closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for ""clean up"".  it turned out to be nothing.",4
"by teaching my baby sign language. i go to this ""mommy and me"" thing every week with my daughter. not because it's my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as ""a christmas gift"" to my one-year-old (aka she doesn't think i am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).

anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. but all these kids know sign language, and i thought that was pretty damn cool. so i start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it's working! suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say ""more"" and ""all done"" and ""drink""! she can call me mom and my husband, dad! holy shit! thanks pinterest moms! i take back all the shit i talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

well today with my husband out of town, i didn't feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants i decided to go out for a quick dinner. the kid loves french fries and so do i. so we hit the local burger joint and i order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. the server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and i set it out of her reach so she doesn't hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. so of course every time she wants some, she signs ""drink"". and every time she wants my attention, she signs ""dad"" because apparently the slightly different sign for ""mom"" isn't as fun for her. ok, whatever. 

well i notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they're looking over at us and snickering. i'm like okay, i did like 4 quick google searches, maybe i botched some of what i taught her. it's fine. but then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iphone down with a message typed out for me to read. it says something to the effect of ""she's calling you 'dumb' and telling you she wants to drink alcohol"". 

i'm like... wait... what? so she continues to show me that i have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for ""drink (non-alcoholic beverage)"" and ""drink alcohol"" and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since i am her mom. i can only imagine what the pinterest moms would've done had i shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

tl;dr asl is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

eta: thanks, everyone! i'm glad you all enjoyed this post. please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that i was trying to teach my child proper asl. they were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as asl. they just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

also please note that i literally searched ""baby sign language"" and based the signs off of still frames from google. i have no idea how close they were to the real signs. additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. she speaks english well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. we were always sure to say the words while signing them. she now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that i decided to share with you all. i'm new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen ""today"". you can take back your upvotes for this as necessary :)",4
"by letting my boyfriend have control over the lube.. we are in the middle of the polar vortex. i got a phone call last night saying that i didn't have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.

we decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. i was ready to get laid, because, well, i wanted to. so i told my boyfriend to grab the lube while i climbed on top of him.

the bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it like this(https://i.imgur.com/llijq5v.jpg). i was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.

because he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. he squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. again, we were drunk, so shit happens.

while he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. he couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as i screamed and jumped off him.  the bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.

i now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. we sobered up real quick, i fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.

&#x200b;

tl;dr boyfriend got too close using the lube, clit got vacuumed into the 7th gate of hell.",4
"because i finally learned how to wipe my butt. i asked my girlfriend the other day, ""why do the doors of the bathroom stalls have space on the bottom?""

she told me they're like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a ""duh\~"" tone.

i followed up by saying, ""but sometimes, people can see my butt.""

she started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.

so i had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; i wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.

i then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/(http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and i was shocked.

we were both curious where/how i even learned that from.

was it a potty training error? apparently not. we asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, & uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.

so, i've been wiping my butt and mooning hundreds of people in bathroom stalls for 20 years of my life.

\#dead

tl;dr

for 20 years, i squatted all the way to the ground after pooping in order to wipe my butt.",4
"as a reaction to butt worms (almost certainly nsfw). this is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened.

also: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.

for background: at some point in my childhood, i developed pin-worms. in the interest of science, i must admit that i don't know for certain that i had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70's and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that i had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.

i'm afraid that i don't know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all i remember is that as a young child i walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and i don't remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.

fast forward a decade and a half: i am living on my own. single. re-acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone i am still close to refers to as ""she-who-must-not-be-named"". i don't remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....i had worms. my butt was beyond-normally itchy. sometimes it didn't phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn't be sent away once it arrived. the confirmation came when i showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.

i hoped they would go away. i showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. but every morning, i would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.

i was horrified, but i made an appointment at my local clinic. when i told the nurse over the phone that i thought i had butt-worms, she was \*extremely\* skeptical. she said it was ""highly unlikely"", but they would do tests.

i went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly south-east indian man, reiterated the nurse's skepticism, could not find anything amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.

i was already frustrated, but i waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirmed the beasties were present, and deposited them in a plastic container. later i drove the sample to the office, and was told it would be 1-3 weeks before i would get results.

in the meantime, i remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom.

i would like to say that as a liberal american male, i wouldn't have any issue, but after 4-5 hours talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that i did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, i dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what i had done.

now to add: i had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. we had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; i wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and i found ourselves showering. my hand drifted down to my butt-crack and i realized i \*needed\* to share my story with her, despite fears that i would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. so i spurted it out: ""uhm, so yeah, i...uh...think i have butt worms....""

she was so practical about it. she asked to see. i pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.

""see,"" i said, embarrassed. ""worms.""

...

""that's toilet paper"", she replied.

""w...what?""

""yeah,"" she said, nonchalantly"". ""that's toilet paper.""

everything fell into place. about a month ago, when finances got tight, i swapped my normal tp roll with dollar store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after i wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.

my relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . my shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.

tldr: i spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because i bought cheap toilet paper.

postscript: shower companion and i just celebrated our 8th year wedding anniversary.",4
"tifu- by not knowing about sunblock expiration dates. i applied spf 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. i was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. 

i pretty much had no idea that i had a problem until i scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. i considered for a split second that i had a burn but like an idiot, i rationalized it as ""sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch"". 

the blisters formed by the next day and i started reading the can to see if i missed something about applying it. i found the customer service number and called it. before talking to anyone, i heard a recording tell me that the fda doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. this bottle was easily 4-5 years old.

i had no clue. 

i went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. 

it was easily one of the most painful things i have ever experienced. except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. i soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. 


this was preventable- sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions.

 https://imgur.com/3nge8nm.jpg 


edit- i want to clear up: i'm naturally, very pale person, i was at high altitude while on and in the water. i do not blame anyone but myself for this. whether expired or i stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. i should have been careful with making sure the things i use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. 
i agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, i just don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. 
this isn't a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. 

i'm not planning to sue anyone although i appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. 
i just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! be safe! skin cancer is a real danger.

tl;dr- sunblock expires.",4
"by watching my neighbours fight while i was eating popcorn.. so i'm a bit of a soccer fan, and today two big local teams had a game, so naturally i was watching the match on my living room little did i know there was another match going on my neighbours house. about ten minutes into my game, i started hearing screams coming from the house across the street.

between the game and the distance between us i really couldn't distinguish any words, so i just raised the volume of my tv and kept watching. during half time i got a bit hungry and decided to make myself some popcorns, for those of you who don't watch sports, half times tend to be a bit long and is just a bunch of commercials so i lower the volume of the tv as i microwave some popcorn.

by this point my neighbours had been fighting for about 30 minutes, and just as i take the popcorns out of the microwave i hear some doors slamming, curiosity got the better of me, so i went to my balcony to see what was the scope of the fight in case i had to call the cops of something. now i have two dogs so i didn't wanted to leave my popcorn bag unattended on the couch, so i brought it with me.

so here i am, staring from my balcony at the 40 year olds married couple who took the fight outside. for the looks of it the wife had kicked the husband out of the house. by now i could tell what the fight was about, nothing too dramatic as to add spice to the story or so i thought. suddenly she slapped him hard on the face, which made him turn as i gasped dramatically, which made them both look up into my balcony.

now try to see this from their perspective. they've been fighting for over 30 minutes, yelling and slamming doors and just as they took their fight outside they see their gay gossip loving neighbour with a big bag of popcorn looking from their balcony. this got them furious, as if defying the laws of physics, their faces turned redder than they already were, and they both took their frustration at me yelling me all sorts of things.

""enjoying the show you \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*!?""

i honestly decided to take one for the team and kept putting popcorn into my mouth as they were yelling at me because it seemed to stop their fight and join them as a twisted dysfunctional couple once again. they both flip the finger at me as walked inside ""can you believe this fucking guy!?"" the wife screamed at her husband as he patted her back and closed the door.

when i got inside i was too busy laughing to enjoy the rest of the game but locally my team won 5-2 so all is good in the world.

edit: i know some redditors don't really like this but thank you so much for the platinum, gold and silvers and all the positive fun comments i've gotten.  you all made my night incredibly fun it's been a blast reading and replying to all your comments! also shut out to all the cruz azul fans who guessed correctly it was the game i was watching!

edit 2: many users seem to think this story wasn't a and it probably isn't a dramatic one i'd say that ruining my relationship with my neighbours by being on the wrong place at the wrong time with some popcorns was a bit of a fuck up but at the end of the day isn't a really big loss as it gave me a blast of a night on reddit.

tl;dr my neighbours were having a big fight while i was watching a soccer game, i went out to check while she slapped her husband as i was holding a big bag of popcorn. my nosing around redirected their anger towards me and now they're back to being a happy dysfunctional marriage again.",4
"update: yesterday, i posted about how i almost killed a girl with asthma by dabbing. thanks to reddit, i asked her out. we're dating!. hey! y'all remember me? yesterday, i made this post (https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a2pdlw/tifu_by_making_a_girl_i_like_laugh_so_hard_she/) about when i almost killed a girl by making them laugh so hard it caused an asthma flare-up. well, thanks to the incredible support of the reddit community (i got hundreds of pms urging me to go for it yall be crazy lol) i asked her out. and guess what....

after promising it most likely would not result in another hospital trip, she said yes! we're going out this friday for a dinner. i know some people warned me about dating people at work, but honestly after what i happened i think i'm kinda obligated by the universe to go for it. 

thanks for giving me the support to do it guys. i was gonna flake-out.
so remember ladies and gents, if you ever have a crush on them, fucking dab on them. if it works with the haters, it'll work with the lovers.

tl;dr. gave a girl an asthma attack by dabbing on them. they laughed too hard and ended up in the hospital. reddit made me work up up the courage to ask them out. somehow it worked. what the hell.

"by telling both my wife and mom about an item on ebay i wanted for my birthday...they unknowingly got into a bidding war against each other and drove the price up considerably.. so my birthday is coming up and i found an item on ebay that i thought would be cool as a present. i figured i would casually mention it to both my wife and my mom...not thinking that either of them would actually try to bid on it.

well lo and behold, they both ended up bidding on it to try to win it for a birthday present for me and they unknowingly got into a bidding war with each other!!! they ended up driving up the price by about $200 before my wife finally won the auction. they could have just bought it new in the store for $50 less then she won it for!

"by not going to the hospital when i knew something was wrong with me. as usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. i'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident i was 29 years old. first, a little back story...

sunday, april 2, 2017 started like any other sunday for me. i woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. i drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. i drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. i was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

as i watched the video i felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. having never had a migraine before, i assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. the pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though i was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. they finished the oil and as they did, i texted my girlfriend to let her know that i had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

i got back to her house, popped a couple ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. i woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.

i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. my girlfriend tried her best to convince me that i needed to go to the er but i told her i just needed more rest and would be fine. she reluctantly let me try to rest as much as i could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. the only relief i could find was taking pain killers, which i'm not a big fan of, and napping.

i woke up tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" against my protest, she dragged me to the er...and saved my life.

i went in to the er and told them my symptoms, also telling them that i have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. they sent me to do a ct scan of my head, without the contrast because i wouldn't let them tap an iv on my arm. the ct scan was performed and i was brought back to the room to await the results. as i sat there i caught the dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""it was at this point i knew....something was fucked up!"" (dave chappelle voice)

the dr. came flying into the room and said, ""hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. i need to tap an iv on you right now, do another ct scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to stanford asap!""

my life stopped. ""a stroke? i'm 29? how could i have had a stroke?"" i couldn't comprehend what was happening but i looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. i got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (side note: i live in california but grew up in new jersey which is where all my family still resides) i quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. i asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

what happened next is a whirlwind. they tapped an iv, did a ct scan then i was transported by ambulance to stanford icu. i was greeted by the entire neurology department, both residents and students alike. the first woman i met said she, ""couldn't believe i was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" she told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

as i laid in icu they tapped an a-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more iv's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. they had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and i wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. they were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

my parents flew in from jersey by the next day and i was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (wednesday). if you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. i've had 3. they lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are not asleep. they then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. let me repeat, you are awake for this!

the first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. the blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. i was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and i was allowed to leave the hospital by friday morning. i used up all my fmla leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

but wait...there's more!!!

6 weeks later i had to go back to stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. this time they found the culprit. i had what is known as an arterioveneous fistula burst inside my brain. it's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. to my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which i did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke i went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. i was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the best neurosurgeons in the world. a 3rd angiogram was performed while i was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

i awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain i have ever been in. while i was asleep, two more iv's had been put into my arm, an a-line had been put in my wrist again, and i had a c-line, which is an iv in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. the fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. the next day after the surgery i realized that i had double vision so bad that i couldn't see with both my eyes open. it was either one or the other. i had to patch my eye until i could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. my surgery was on a wednesday and by friday i was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

fast forward, to october 2, 2017.

my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. around 11:30 am i took my lunch and finished reading my book i had been reading. at 12:30 pm i returned to work and about 10 minutes later i decided i had to use the bathroom. i left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. i started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. i think i tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in april) for help but i don't remember because i blacked out. next thing i remember was a foreman standing over me asking if i was alright and all i could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

i was delirious, i had smashed my face on the concrete when i fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. my supervisor took me to the er where they did ct scans, blood work, ekg and chest x-rays. my white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

i did a follow up with my pcp (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to stanford neurology to talk with them. and so i have...and this is where i am today...

i was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. the issue, as i've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. due to the amount of time i allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.

what this means for me now is i'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. thank god the company i work for is so large that they can move me to another position where i won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment i feel. working construction has been my all time favorite. i'm a blue collar guy and i get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. i've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. my days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is done. it sucks. i'm not happy about it, but i don't let it change my outlook on life.

i refuse to give up on life. i can get through anything and i will get through this. i'm out of work until january 8, 2018 at which point i will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as i did before.

i tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. please, i'm begging you! if you ever feel like something is wrong with you...do not hesitate! go to the hospital! don't be like me, mr. toughguy, thinking you can get through it. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. may god bless your life and your health

"by trying to buy an instant pot at target and probably ending up on a terrorist watchlist. this started yesterday but i didn't realize my fu until today.

yesterday, i stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt instant pot at target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. i decided i would get some christmas shopping done early and flip a few. i ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. i go to target and give them my id, they look it up and can't find it at first. i give them the order number and i hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. the one says he has to let the manager know i'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but i didn't think much of it.

fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. the doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. i step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the state police counter terrorism unit and they start questioning me about why i'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if i know what they can be used for, if i'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the target parking lot. i did my best to explain the price mistake and how i found it, etc. i think they accepted my explanation but i'm still nervous that i'm on a watchlist now.

tl:dr tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 instant pots at target, got interrogated by state police counter terrorism unit why i was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.

edit: here's the investigator's card since so many people seem to be doubting my story. i covered up personal info so i don't dox him or myself.

"by missing every sign on a date. so didn't happen today, but rather yesterday. i invited a close friend to the movies with me. a few odd things happened, and it wasn't until i spoke to a friend of mine that i realized i missed multiple hints that she was into me. 

1) beforehand, i jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and i got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). she replies ""don't worry, if that were you and i, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. i laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. i replied, ""i guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. she then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in my car though"". i then replied ""you know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

3) when we get back to her house, she asks if i want to go inside to get a soda, to which i politely declined because i wasn't thirsty.

tldr: i missed strong signs that she was dtf


edit: there is an upside to this however: she's very eager to go to the movies again.

"by attempting suicide without realizing it. so, as i was making myself breakfast this morning, i for some reason started wondering what would happen if i touched one of the glowing wires inside the toaster while it was on. being the very intelligent man i am, i of course did not want to touch it with my bare hands. i instead took a fork out of the drawer and without thinking, sticked it right into the toaster. a small bolt of electricity shot up from the toaster and the toaster shut itself off.

the worst part is, i still didn't realize what i had actually just done. i just thought, ""uh huh, whatever"" and put the fork back into the drawer. as i grabbed the bread it clicked on me that there is a current running through the wires and that i had almost electrocuted myself. maybe i was saved by my other hand not being on the dishwashing table, which is made of metal. if i had been  leaning against the tabletop to reach the toaster better, i would have gotten an electric shock.

i haven't told anyone yet, and i don't think i will.

"by creating a special handshake with my daughter (nsfw?). this is an ongoing tifu, i am actively looking for ways to end it.

my daughter is 3. she is the light of my life and all that. because she isn't much for drinking or golf, i have had to find activities we both enjoy to pass the day. this means we spend a great deal of time watching movies. my favorite is e.t. and i figured she'd love it too. wrong. e.t. is terrifying to a little girl. in an effort to make e.t. fun, i taught her the fingertip touch ""ouch"" thing and then we watched that scene a few times in a row. it went well and now e.t. no longer scares her. win.

she has held onto the fingertip touch and it has taken on a life its own, a bit like a not-at-all-secret handshake for us. we always do it before she goes to sleep.

her: *puts out finger* finger!

me: *touches finger* ouch!

super cute right? well... she has now taken to doing it anywhere, at any time. it became pretty annoying and when i tried to curb the frequency of it, i was met with disaster. last weekend we were at the mall when she announced loudly in a quiet jewelry store that she was going to give me the finger. a little embarrassing but not too bad. i told her that she can't say it like that because ""the finger"" sometimes means something bad. she nods, understanding and the moment passes. a few days later, at dinner with my in-laws, the handshake returns to the forefront of her mind. mid-meal, she says, ""finger! oh no wait, that's bad..."" she then thinks for a moment and screams, ""daddy, finger me!"" if i could have turned into a flock of birds and flown away forever, i would have. my in-laws turn bright red and stare at her. i immediately say, ""no no, that's not what its called"". my daughter doubles down, ""yes! finger me! ouch! remember? ouch!"" i nearly passed out.

we are now trying to rebrand the handshake as ""et"" and ""ouch"" because jesus christ i can't take her anywhere.

"by looking at my fiances location history and found out that she has been cheating on me.. obligatory ""this happened two days ago.""

i had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. i proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! or so i thought. 

about 3 weeks after our proposal, i notice she starts acting different. not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. she had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of m-f each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. i went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when i have work the next day, so i often opted out.

we would also share our google location with each other at all times. mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and i would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. i looked at her location one day and it was turned off. i texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. hadn't been a problem for the past year. she turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. she also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. i only had the location for the personal phone. eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.

two days ago, about a month after the proposal, i decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and i just wanted to put it to rest. i used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. she had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. i called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. she said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.

i waited until she got home and confronted her about it. she said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought i would get mad. turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. i kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time i asked.

the next day when i got home from work, i asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. she said she deleted them. so i said i wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. i started recovering the data from the last backup. she sat down beside me while i was doing it, and asked what i was doing. i told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! so she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. i asked her one last time, ""before i look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?"" she was silent. i asked flat out ""did you sleep with him?"" and she said yes. turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. so that's a win i guess.

planning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. havn't told her yet. still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. feels shitty but i'm keeping my head up.

tldr; by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. it has been one month since the proposal now.

edit: wow! thank you all for the encouraging comments! they help so much more than i would've thought. some of these really got to me, and reading that i should've posted this as a lifeprotip made me laugh. most if all, it helped me confirm that it was not a fu on my part, but actually a gift that it happened so early. thank you all, so much! going to read through and respond to as many as i can.

"by kicking my son!. this happened a few weeks ago.

my ~6 year old son came running in to my home office the other day and said, demandingly, ""dad! kick me!""

so i did.

hear me out, please. the kick was a 3/10 on firmness. not gentle, but not painful. he's a kid, he likes to play fight, and as he's an only child, i feel like i need to provide a bit of rough and tumble so that he can learn boundaries. i also want him to ""lose some battles"", and to learn to ""roll with the punches"". 

anyway... i performed a front kick whilst making the bruce lee noise. i trust that you know the one. 

my son recoiled. he looked shocked, sad and disappointed, all rolled into one. he didn't cry,, but it was close.

he blurted out ""i said kiss me!!!""

oops!



tldr; i misheard my son, which resulted in me kicking him.",4
"by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended. obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. my brother and i have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). this agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so i was convinced he still remembered.

a couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. i got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. i decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. there's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. so i went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""brother's name, if you're watching this, i'm already dead. everyone on the world pretty much is. it's been about eight months since you went to hospital name. you need to head for the safe haven in helsinki (we live in western canada) - mom might be there. god speed."" i managed to sync it up to the tv and woke him up as it was starting.

this is where it all goes to complete shit. my brother began to lose it immediately. he started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. i grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. nurses came in and i was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

he got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. my mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. my dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. i'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. i've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

worth the wait though.

tl;dr: convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital

edit: wow this blew up?! i don't have a ton of time but:

1) i don't want to upload the video. i made it sound tamer than it was, i look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xd

2) the tvs in the hospital had hdmi ports. i just plugged it into my chromebook. 

3) i can see why people say i made this up for karma, but i didn't create a throwaway to do that.  if i cared that much, i would've posted it on my main account.

4) my mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. she hasn't been happy with me moving (western canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. she paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",4

"by having the best dream at the wrong time. i had the most vivid sex dream the other day. the kinda dream no one would want to wake up from. i was one of the founding members of the x-men, and i was balls deep in mutant pussy. so, fucking was literally my superpower. i could cure the sick with my cum. humans and mutants alike flocked to my cock. including the members of the x-men. so, in this dream, i was fucking blink and jubilee. sparks were flying in the bedroom. i mean, damn. i never really gave a fuck about these characters in real life. but deep down in dreamland, i gave *all* the fucks. i experienced the most explosive orgasm. i woke up at that moment.

oof. i was in the gawd damn plane that time with a string of saliva drooling down my chin, a visible buldge, and jizz stains seeping through my pants. i'm not hung like a horse or some shit, but boners are fucking hard to hide sometimes. especially if you're wearing loose pants. i locked eyes with the passenger next to me. she wasted no time handing me one of her pillows to place over my penis. it had the words ""best mom ever"" on the pillow case. *of course it had*. at that point i realized life was pulling out all the fucking stops. i was too embarrassed to really speak, but i managed to squeeze out an awkward thank you to the passenger. she shook her head as if to say ""don't mention it"". and then she said this fucking shit: 

""don't worry, you've said enough in your sleep""

""i'm sorry?""

""i have a son who's also into x-men""

"by telling my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me. this happened approximately six years ago, i was laughing about it with my friend today, who recommend that i post it here. 

&#x200b;

so, flashback to undergrad, things are good and i just started dating this beautiful girl that i had met in class. i was enamored with her, shocked that i loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. the first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. 

&#x200b;

after a few months into our relationship, i started to notice some concerning symptoms. as you can probably hypothesize, when i pee'd, it burned. at first, i just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, i decided to stop taking creatine just in case. but, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. i would literally be struggling to stand while i pee'd because the pain was so intense. after, i would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. it was bad. 

&#x200b;

well, at this point, i was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. no, it had to be what i thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. i hadn't been with anyone else. i hadn't been with anyone else since i began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. i was shocked. things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had i gone wrong? the thought made my blood boil, until i outright confronted her. i told her i knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. she told me no. i demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. she said sure. (looking back at this i feel like a complete dick). we agreed that we would go the next day.

&#x200b;

the same night i confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. she was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. around this time my roommates and i had just moved into a new house. in the process all our belongings got shuffled around. as she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed ""why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!"" i heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, i've been pissing out bleach?!?! i instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. she took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr - months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when i pee'd. i told my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an std test. the night before we went, i inadvertently discovered that i had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap.

"giving my 17 yr old nephew advice on how to meet women.. a few weeks ago i flew out to fresno to visit my younger sister and her family since i havent seen them in 4 years. the first night in town was wonderful and wholesome. they gave me a quick tour of the local sights and we ended up at a local restaurant for a family dinner. the conversation was mostly about family stuff and how the boys were doing in school. the older son ,""alec"", was enjoying thus far his senior year at hs and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. on the other hand is my nephew ""dan"" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. when i pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more ""robust"" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and dan. being the cool uncle i let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. as she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my marine corps days. if he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. but dont go empty handed. i suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. now that i think of it i was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. so the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.
 a few days later it occured to all of us dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. when his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. i however was not buying it. i pulled him aside and got the truth. the boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. he would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. he met a girl and they had been seeing each other. i was happy i could help and could not believe it actually worked. however things went south. 
 a few days after my return to the east coast i received a very emotional call from my sister. she explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a ""have you seen this man"" flier on the door. it was a grainy surveillance photo of dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. the flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. when she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. now dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and i told i am not invited for christmas. poor dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.

tl;dr.  i royally fucked up by telling my 17 year old nephew to meet big girls by hanging out in front of womens plus sized stores with food causing him to be forever grounded and causing  possible restraining orders, as well as me no longer invited to my sisters.",4
"by putting a thong that was not my wife's in her underwear drawer. this happened 2 days ago. so last week i found a thong on the floor in my living room. smelt it like the animal i am, was clean, and put it in my wife's underwear drawer.

2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.

huh... i found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? it was clean so i put it in your drawer. what it's not yours?

angrily, she answers it's not hers. you just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?

i tell her what the hell am i suppose to say. she goes back upstairs really angry at me.

so last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. i send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. it is. we're both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... we came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...

now the real fuck up. my wife is in the bed. i go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. just texted her and the thong is hers. the only explanation we managed to find it's that it was stuck by static at her clothes.

you want me to believe that?! that makes no sense

jesus christ, i don't even believe my explanation myself. i tell her to believe what she wants, i don't fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that i don't have anything to redeem myself. i take some clothes and go sleep at my parents' home.

the next morning she calls me. she tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it's logical that i'd put it in her drawer. and if i was cheating on her, i'd be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.

tldr : found my friend's thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife's underwear drawer. almost lost my wife to it.

edit : omg it exploded. thanks for the silver mystery redditors! i know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that's ultimately your right! had fun with the others that told similar stories :) and yes, i told my friend that i sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.

"by eating the ends off a chicken wing.. yesterday i ate the ends of a chicken wing. someone told me the ends were crunchy, like pork crackling, so i tried it out. i never expected this to happen. 

i must not have chewed one properly. i got something lodged in my throat. to dislodge it i ate some bread and drank some softdrink. some pain persisted but i went to sleep last night hoping it'd be fine in the morning. 

this morning i woke with tremendous pain in my throat and chest. i walked to the public hospital down the road because i was starting to worry. 

the gp noticed i had a ""crunchy throat"" when pressing on it. he immediately sent me off to get an xray. that showed i have a perforated esophagus. that is, the tube from my mouth to my stomach has been punctured. the ""crunchy"" feeling was air that had shifted into parts of my neck it shouldn't be. 

to get more information i started reading a journal on the condition and how to treat it.

they consider it a critical medical condition with a 20% chance of mortality. it's so rare that its incedent rate is 3.1/1 million people. a few random doctors even asked if they could feel my neck to experience the crunchy feeling. they said they'd read about it in textbooks, but you never see it. 

now i'm waiting on the results of the ct scan which will determine whether i get surgery or just have to fast for a few days while my body fixes it. if i'd waited over 24hrs there would be a much higher risk. 

tl;dr: i ate the ends off a chicken wing and now i'm in hospital with a critical condition with a 20% mortality rate.

**update:** a surgeon just spoke to me. i have to be nil-by-mouth for 7 days to help my body heal the holes in the throat and chest areas of my esophagus. they don't expect me to need surgery so that's a plus.

**update 2:** the main surgeon just spoke to me. i'll be here at least 7 days, even if the pain goes away. the critical problem is non-sterile air has passed through the hole and entered a vulnerable area that must be sterile. so i can't eat or drink to reduce the risk of that area getting infected and i need to wait until the air is absorbed by the tissue.

**update 3:** i had a tube pushed into my arm, through a vein, all the way to the top of my heart. it's called a picc. it's how i'll be eating and drinking over the next week.",4
"by setting my wifi hotspot to ""bomb detonator"". title says most of it.  i was at a tech conference today.  i like to broadcast random wifi hotspot names to mess with people and after the recent story about the planet fitness  i thought it would go over well as a joke.  i mean, who hasn't seen ""fbi surveillance van"" as a network?

*holy fuck.*  **do not do this!!!**

cops got called.  i got to spend about 45 minutes chatting with them.  they asked a lot of questions.  they had to make sure i'm not a threat.  i cooperated fully.  i have no doubt being a white guy at a nerd gathering probably helped.  i was told i wasn't being charged.  i was, however, told to leave by the venue and not come back.

flash forward two hours and i go to log into my work email on my phone.  huh.  password failed.  huh, again.  ok, let's not fat finger this and lock the account.  pull out the laptop, remote into my work pc.  go to log in.  ""your account has been disabled. contact your systems administrator.""

20 minutes later i get the text message.

*you are being placed on paid administrative leave effective today 5/23 while the agency investigates today's events surrounding you being removed from the <venue>. you are not to complete any work, access agency networks or report to the office during your leave. we will contact you when the investigation is complete.*

tl;dr: immature joke kills career, film at 11.

**edit:**  thank you for the influx of comments and messages.  most of you are right, i am a fucking idiot.  one doesn't come to r/to brag about the good shit they've done.  no matter what you say, i'm trying to keep up.  you're helping me cope.

"by accidentally pulling out my gf's tampon while watching tv. yesterday evening my gf and i thought it would be nice to watch lord of the rings after coming home quite late. after aproximately 4 hours i was really tired and couldnt think straight anymore. she had her ""strawberry week"" so she was plugged, which i frankly didnt care too much about. we just came along the credits in the movie and i was casually stroking her ass when i realised there is a thread hanging somewhere.

i thought its just a random thread from the blanket, you know the ones hanging from some clothes.

i think it was muscle reflexes or something like this, my tired brain didnt think at all and i just pulled hard without realising of what i just did.

my girlfriend said: "" wtf are you do-"" and it was already out creating a mess everywhere until i realised what actually happened.

after explaining that i thought its from the blanket, my gf couldnt stop laughing and i felt quite ashamed. made up the bed right after and went to sleep right next to my still giggling gf.

"by picking up a hitchhiker and then showing up to my own funeral. this happened a few years ago and i was living in zimbabwe at the time, and i was having a pretty bad day, i was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. if youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. so i got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so i do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
i get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....then i here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so i wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. so i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

i explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where i am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). i start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so i pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and i dont have the best memory so i didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch i let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which i thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, i take down his number so i can repay him later on. at this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, i walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. im about 100 feet from the house and i see my son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. i get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like ive been gone for months. my auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

i still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and i see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


so it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what i had stumbled upon.
my son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

tl;dr got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and i somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

"by announcing to my daughter that i only shave my vag when her dad is due home. this literally just happened about an hour ago and had me and my husband alternating between cringing in embarrassed, and giggling like a couple of immature schoolchildren.

for context, my husband works away at sea for weeks at a time; he is due to leave later today, so is busy getting organised and packed up ready to go. 

he realised that he had ran out of razor blades, so being the loving wife that i am, i offered him one of my unused razor blades to tide him over until he can buy more on the mainland.
he commented that he didn't want to leave me short, and i assured him that that wouldn't be the case as i use an epilator on my legs and underarms, and only shave my foo-foo when he's due home. cue my daughter walking into the kitchen at that exact moment and awkwardly making eyecontact with me before walking back out the way she had come. 

tl;dr basically the title, and the fact that my 13-year-old daughter has learnt a bit more about her mother than probably either of us are comfortable with her knowing.

"by masturbating in front of my entire family. this happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which i was extremely anxious about. all together, i was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager i am, i often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

so, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, i lay down in my living room with my family, watching tv. i dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since i had done next to no study at the time). 

not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, i decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

and so off i went. except i forgot one thing.

i was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that i was not in fact sitting with my family by our tv, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

i don't really understand how or why it happened. a few seconds in and i began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

i snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment i put myself in. 

i'm not going to talk about what happened next, as i don't want to relive the next few moments.

my father is just disappointed. he hasn't talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

my mother believes that we should ""embrace my sexuality"", and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as i write this. 

and i'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it's a good excuse to be alone. i find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe i was just dreaming while i was gassed up. 

but it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

tl:dr returned from dentist gassed up, beat my meat while in front of my whole family, i now live in shame.",4
"by buying my mom an amazon device.. i want to start by giving some background here. i basically live, eat, sleep and breath amazon. i need something, straight to amazon. i use kindle and audible daily. want to stream music, amazon music. want a new movie, prime video. run out of something randomly, ""hey alexa......."" laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. so when looking for a place to store photos, i see ""prime members have free unlimited photo storage with amazon photos"". naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. automatically upload photos from my phone? even better. 

rewind to september 25th, my mom's birthday. i thought about her gift for a while, but when i remembered she didn't have a smart tv, the answer was easy. i hop on amazon shopping and use my amazon credit card to purchase one firetv stick. she was so happy she could watch netflix on her tv now. yay, success! or so i thought. 

yesterday i get an email from amazon with the subject line ""welcome to the fire tv family"" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did i imagine that it would sign in to my amazon account without even asking for a password. surely she'd have to use her own account. 

fast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. sitting in my mother's kitchen, i glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65"" photo of my vagina. 

i spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. i happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. i'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. i took probably 40 pictures that night for my so to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my entire family to view. i have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. 

nobody helped me. the remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where i'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. i didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, i just ran away. 

the worst part, i asked alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand ""sorry, i'm not sure about that."" fuck amazon.

update: i promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. i talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. however, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. 

i'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an amazon ad, i just wrote it how i wrote it because i thought it was funny. i wish amazon was paying me for this crap. 

i'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. yes i fucked up, i was a dumbass, that's why i posted it here. yes, i should have known this could happen. call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my so do. it's fun. i don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. it happened. 

thanks to everyone for the awards and sharing your similar stories, they made me laugh. and thanks for checking out my cat!!!!!

"by joking about ancestrydna and 23andme.. this actually happened over christmas last year.

my family, including (paternal) my grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousins and 2nd cousins were having christmas dinner. 

my grandfather brought up that he did ancestrydna (or was it 23and me?). i don't remember the exact one, because i can barely think about it. it's hard just writing this up.

it was really cool to hear what he found. he found mostly scandinavian spread out over the british isles, particularly wales. we knew this part already, but then it was discovered he's 3% persian! very small, and probably doesn't mean much really, but cool nonetheless. he's a huge genealogy guy, so he's been working on his lineage. 

the only ancestor he's mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we're a direct but illegitimate descendant of king george iii. the reason why i question this is king george iii is recorded as one of the few kings who never had a mistress. 

however, he believes it because there's a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of king george iii (we are descended from the woman). he mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.

anyway, off topic. i thought it was fascinating, and i love hearing what he's found. i brought up possibly using my christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. i don't think i was really going to do it, i usually use the money to pay bills.

silence. and it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.

my sister and i look at each other quietly, wondering who's the half sibling. my parents haven't said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. we look like our parents, the only thing that's different is my eyes. i have weird hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. my sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. 

i always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. i never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it's not fair i have such cool pretty eyes. 

well, okay.

dad starts first. dad (d), mom (m), sister (s), and me.

d: there's a chance 3ar3ara_g0rd0n, that you're not my daughter.

s and me: imagine that wide-eyed stunned look. my sister grabs my hand (i love her big sister ways).

me: okay, um... 

d: your mom never had an affair. this isn't some cheating story.

me: wha.. (i start to feel very sick).

m: i hoped to never have to tell you this. i was raped. the reason we're not sure is because your dad and i had sex earlier that day.

me: (i want to die, i start crying). everyone else knows though, if they left the table.

d: your grandparents know.

s: okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?

m: no, they wouldn't move forward with the case. 

me: he's still out there?

s: but obviously we're far away from this guy, right?

my dad and mom look at each other. 

m: it was my brother.

i felt so sick. i felt... dirty. i had to run to the bathroom to throw up. i couldn't stop shaking. my sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. we probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren't thinking.

our husbands were just stunned and quiet.

the rest of the vacation was just weird. if it weren't for my nephews, i'm pretty sure i would have just gone home.

oh my nephews are wonderful.

well, we came home, and i had to battle with the ""do i want to know?"" thoughts. i could get a dna test. but i couldn't do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. but it weighed on me too much. i had to know in order to move forward. so i asked my dad if he would submit his dna with mine. we weren't going to tell my mother if it wasn't the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. it was hard asking him to not say anything to her. he should be able to talk to his wife.

so we submitted the test. 

i am my father's daughter. i cried when i got the results. it was a huge weight off my shoulders.

i made a decision not to tell my dad - i wanted to surprise them. i kept saying i hadn't gotten the results back. i did tell my sister though.

i gave them the piece of paper on mother's day. i was going to wait until father's day, but i couldn't. so i got a blank card. 

inside i wrote: ""mom, open the paper."" she opened it and i had written happy mother's day, and happy early father's day. 

lots of hugs and tears that day, yah? 

thank god.

edit: left out half a sentence, oops. 

it was my uncle on my mother's side. i have met him. my sister and i were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. 

family did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. 

my parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn't go through with it. two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there i guess was his reason. plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn't believe her. 

my mom didn't go no contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel's back. why that long, i have no idea. those are her reasons. 

she did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. i guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.

grandmother is dead now.

this happened in louisiana. 

edit 2: mods, if this isn't considered appropriate for this sub, please feel free to take it down. i thought i fucked up by the secret coming out in the first place. but it is a happy ending. i leave it up to you glorious mods.

**tl;dr:** i found out i could have been the product of a rape - by my uncle. anxiety and tears ensued. found out i am my father's daughter. surprised them. happy ending!",4
"by my wife and i referring to ""no"" as the ""n word"" with our 12 month old son and having child protective services called on us. so my wife and i have a four year old and a one year old.  when our one year old is up to mischief and we tell him ""no"" he immediately looks up at us and starts crying.  it's actually pretty adorable.

in order not to upset him we frequently refer to it as the ""n word"" when he's around.  

queue two weeks ago when our four year old is in daycare and telling all his friends and the teacher that ""mommy and daddy use the n word all the time and it upsets his brother and makes him cry"".  teacher berated my wife and told her we were horrible people and didn't really get it when my wife explained that it was a big mix up.

we also got child protective services called on us anonymously.  think it's the teacher but it may have been a parent.

tldr: everyone at our kids school thinks we are constantly throwing ""the bad n word"" around our sons and are horrible people and parents.

"being jesus. this happened on halloween. i imagined the evening going down more or less like this: 

1. slip into a white robe.
2. stick on a cactus crown. 
3. moonwalk out of the house as jesus. 
4. remember never to break character. 
5. hop into an uber. 
6. show up to celebrate halloween with friends. 
7. go ham.
8. go home. 
9. go sleep.
10. go for a job interview the next morning.

this is what i would've called a good night. however, after #7, things didn't quite go as planned. here's how shit actually unfolded:

8. got shit-faced.
9. drunk me turned into drunk jesus. 
10. fell into my friend's swimming pool and almost drowned after attempting to walk on water.
11. realized wearing all white, plus water, equals everyone seeing your shriveled up shlong through your tighty whities.

13. unleashed an unholy amount of vomit in the uber driver's car on the way home.
14. missed my job interview the following day after waking up laughably late.
15. realized drunk me set the alarm on my phone two years into the fucking future.

"by ejaculating in front of my girlfriend's mother. now this didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and i am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

so, a few weeks ago i was at my gf's house, usually the plan when i go is i sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch tv, play games and other stuff. everything was normal, i chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general tv.

this is where the fuck up happens.

after around an hour or so, me and my gf were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

i'm enjoying this more than i ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since i started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

she starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. literally within less than 30 seconds, i'm already ready to release my load, i try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but i just can't, it feels too good. 

right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst i'm there in my birthday suit. my girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock i release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

i sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. my girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then i hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

although me and my gf are still together, i haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

tl;dr - gf was giving me a blowjob whilst her mother walked in, she stopped but it was too late and i ejaculated all over myself in front of both her and her mother, whilst in my birthday suit.",4
"by being funnier than my so and allowing her to post it on reddit.. this happened last night/the wee hours of this morning. 

last night while my so was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. she is a bartender and didn't want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. 

me, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. so i jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. 

while i'm making my journey, i decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. i'm in a pretty great mood. i had the day off and my so was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some new girl. 

my journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. just open desert. so while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. ""what can i do to add a little romance to this situation? cover the bed in some dove chocolates? maybe some flowers?"" 

i make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. miraculously, i made it back home before her.

finally i decide, ""nah, romance isn't nearly as great as comedy."" so when i get home, i break open the box and spell out ""anal?"" on the bed with the tampons. 

so gets home and goes straight to the room to change. i follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. 

she takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. now she won't stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is ""famous"". 

i've created a monster. 

tldr; spelled out ""anal?"" with my so's tampons. she thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. reddit agreed and now she thinks she's famous and is holding her new found karma over my head.

edit: wow! my first ever medal. thank you kind stranger. now at least i can hold this over her head whenever she randomly shouts out how much karma she has.

edit 2: gentleman, we are currently in the lead. whoever has more karma at the end of the night gets to fuck the others ass.

edit 3: we are ending this ""contest"" at 11:59 pst on 7/17/19. it looks like i am going to win but since she is not able to edit/update her original post, i would like to say a few things... i had no clue this would blow up like this. i thought i'd get 10 upvotes and send it to her as a joke when she was being obnoxious about having 2500 more karma than me in the span of a day while i've been in here for a year. this has made our day off together one of the best ones in a while.

"my wife nearly died during the birth of my son three months ago. he was born very premature and he's had some physical challenges. we took him on his first flight and he was really well behaved. what did i choose to watch? finding nemo. very, very stupid choice.. tl;dr i was holding on to a lot of trauma, and the emotion came pouring out.

she had pre-eclampsia, which is not totally rare. but she only exhibited a headache and none of the other features until her blood pressure shot through the roof. he was born shortly after we were admitted to the hospital and while it was the happiest day of my life i haven't really had the chance to fully deal with the trauma of walking into a hospital thinking my pregnant wife would get a shot to quell a headache, only to haven't to confront the reality of possibly walking out alone. i chose not to focus on any of that. instead, i put my head down and concentrated on the things we could control.

he was in the nicu for several weeks and everyday we had to be strong parents for our son fighting for his life. and of course, once he graduated from the nicu we suddenly had a baby to turn into a full-grown human.

the lack of sleep is real. plus, post-partum and the grief of not experiencing the full-term has been very difficult for my wife. meanwhile, i'm a freelance artist who has been getting a lot of work recently after a very dry few months. basically, i've had absolutely no time to slow down and think about everything.

this was a transcontinental flight. he was marvelous. slept almost the whole way, even after our flight was delayed for 7 hours and we spent the entire day at the airport. my wife had held him most of the flight while i caught up on some work. but when her back was aching i took him and i looked for something to watch. i didn't want anything too stressful and i thought, ""finding nemo has that thomas newman score and the blue and orange will be soothing."" i had completely forgotten about the beginning. really, really dumb.

but i couldn't turn it off. even as the snot out-volumed the tears. in a sense, it was like an ice bath—at first, it stabbed me like a thousand knives but once i relaxed and let it wash over me, i felt that part of me begin to heal.

we're both starting therapy because we have a man to make and we can't be good parents without being ones who are as healthy as possible. this is just the beginning as a parent. but, i can't help but think that maybe 'finding nemo' helped me figure out just how much i'd been holding inside. which, is coincidentally kinda the whole point of the film: letting go.

edit: i just woke up and when i sat down to feed him his morning bottle i realized my phone was going crazy. this is crazy. i can't believe how much this has blown up! thank you everyone for your words of encouragement. i cannot adequately express how much that means to us.

also, to answer a little bit of a fair question, this is a fu because i didn't really choose the right venue for this, or stop to think that pixar is pretty much synonymous with sobbing. planes already heighten our insecurities so choosing a film that will surely make me cry in that environment was not a great choice.",4
"by not removing my girlfriends phone from my bed.. obligatory this didn't happen today, but actually close to a year ago. last october to be exact. 

so backstory. i had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. they just didn't want one thing: us having sex before marriage. they had a lot of reasons. and we were actually planning on it. but we both weren't virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. so of course, temptation got the better of us. okay, end of backstory. 

she was a senior in high school and i had just started college about an hour away. we rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. we would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. everytime she would leave i would get sad, but knew i'd see her again. 

one time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. no answer. she said she was gonna text her. made sense to me. once she said we had, we got right to business. she put her phone on the bed, and i didn't even 

things went on for awhile. lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. lots of fun. and by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. followed by some vibrating. it was her phone ringing, but we couldn't find it. then we found it under my ass. we laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. it was her mom. and within seconds, my girlfriend's expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. 

turns out that she hadn't clicked send on the text she sent out. so her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. and in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone ""daddy"" who was definitely not her dad (the mother's words, not mine).  

she told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. 
my girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. i attempted to calm her down but she wouldn't. so i drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying ""how could she do this"" and other things along those lines. my girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. her mother absolutely said i was not allowed over. 

so we got back to our hometown, i parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn't get caught. she drove home. i called my mom for a surprise ""i'm home for the weekend"". she came and picked me up, and i bawled in her arms. i told her everything. she comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. 

we got back to my house, and i laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. i cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. for the longest time, i thought i never would hear from her again. then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. she said she was coming over and we needed to talk. once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. she said her parents were calm now, and then i was gonna be able to come talk. i was nervous, but i loved her so i did it. 

when i got to their house, i walked in and instantly just started apologizing. i went on and on about how ""we won't do it again"" and how ""we're just stupid teenagers"" and most importantly how i was gonna ""rebuild their trust"". eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. we opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.

at the end of it all, i learned they just loved their daughter and didn't want her getting hurt. but they trusted me. and we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. and everything is cool. sometimes i worry it's still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support. 

tldr: my girlfriend and i took phone sex to a whole other level.

edit: holy fuck you guys i went to class and come out and this is what i see???? thank you so much for the gold stranger. my first gold!",4
"by forgetting babies exist.. so i've been spending a lot of time around dogs. i've recently been hired by friends families and family friends to walk or watch their dogs. my reddit is covered in dogs from various sources. my facebook is solely dog pages and dog-related charities. basically everywhere i turn, i see dog. not a bad life to live. until yesterday (yifu i know). i walked one of my mother's friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. it wasn't very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. it's hot. i've just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. i want to blame dehydration for this fu, but really i know i'm just an idiot. a couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. my first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. i don't know. it's a hot day and i've seen dogs in pushchairs before. maybe they didn't want its paws on hot tarmac. maybe they're just a little extra. regardless, the thought that babies exist didn't enter my tiny stupid brain. as they got up to leave and walk by me, i decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words ""what breed is it?"" and gestured towards the pushchair. they looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. it was a baby. a human baby. i'm so glad they took the traditional british approach of confused stare and silence. if they had said something i think i would have disintegrated on the spot. it was a long walk home after that and thankfully, i didn't pass anymore pushchairs. 

tl;dr i asked a woman what breed her baby was after seeing one too many dog on the internet.",4
"by flashing my breasts...not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam for a new job.. i've been in the very early stages of interviewing at this company for about three weeks now. ""early stages"" feels like i joke because i've had at least three interviews with their recruiter so far.

as part of the hiring process for company x, you have to meet with the recruiter, take a personality test, take a logical reasoning test, interview with the hiring manager, complete a case study, present to a panel, and then individually interview with the whole team. it's a lot. i also think this it's a bit ridiculous, but i *really* hate my job. what can you do?

anyway, i pass the early interview parts with my recruiter, and he informs me i'm ready for the next step: the personality and logical reasoning tests. to ensure i'm not cheating on these tests, and because they don't want me to come in for a proctored test, i have to use their software to record myself taking the exam from my computer's camera.

now, when i'm not spending my time applying for new jobs, i'm working from home for my current job. because i wfh, i'm not always the most presentable. we're talking sweats 100% of the time and showers only 45% of the time. i look bummy. i'm a bummy girl who works from home. to be clear though, i'm not unhygienic or filthy, just bummy.

anyway. i didn't take this into consideration when i opened up my computer for these tests. i *really* didn't take it into consideration when i opened up the program to begin the tests. i only took it into consideration when staring back at me on the screen was my greasy, messy bun and  my four-sizes-too-big, holey sweatshirt.

and then...because apparently i have no shame??? i decided to watch myself *sniff* the neck of my sweatshirt to even see if it's clean (it wasn't). this was a super sobering moment, guys.

i really wanted to put on a semi-good impression here. so, i stood up from my workspace (aka my bed) to make myself a little more presentable. while getting up, i haphazardly moved my computer (which had been on my lap) off to the side with the screen facing the open part of my room. i took off my super-holey sweatshirt to put on something a little nicer. that's when i realized i wasn't wearing a bra (why would i be. i'm wfh, remember?), and the shirt i'd planned to quickly throw on wouldn't work without one. i started rummaging around in my dresser for a bra. i pull one out, put it on. dig through my closet for that single shirt i was looking for. find it, put it on. bam. ready.

i flopped back down on my bed to take the exam (looking at least 67% better). getting myself all situated, i went to push record to start the exam.

there was no record button.

instead, there was a red ""light"" in the corner and a timer counting up. it read something like 00:09:04.

it had been recording the entire time. the whole time.

me cringing at my reflection? recorded. me smelling my sweatshirt? recorded. me dickin' around my room with my titties out? *recorded.*

i had been topless for a solid six minutes of that 00:09:04 time. for an eternally-long six minutes, my titties had been out, flopping around, being recorded.

i can *only* imagine what my face looked like on that camera when i realized. i definitely whisper-spoke  ""*fuck,""* and stared at the red little light for a while. maybe a blacked out? i don't know. what i did know in that moment, was that i was royally fucked. the recorded video submitted when you closed the window. there was nothing i could do.

and then...because i'm a dumbass, guys. i went ahead and *finished* the tests and submitted it all.

so. that's it. there you have it. i might now have nudes on the internet. i might get my recruiter fired for nsfw videos. or, who knows? i might get the job.

tl;dr by not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam while changing clothes. i may have exposed my breasts to my recruiter and perhaps an entire hr department.

edit: i'm not going to show you my titties. quit it.",4
"by injecting myself with leukemia cells. title speaks for itself. i was trying to inject mice to give them cancer and accidentally poked my finger. it started bleeding and its possible that the cancer cells could've entered my bloodstream.

"tifu by telling my gf to go right.. i finally get to post a fuck up. happened an hour ago, still afraid for my life.

my gf and i were playing mario party 7 for the first time ever. awful game by the way. anyways, as most of you probably know, you can pick what direction you character travels around the map. the gf, in 3rd place with nearly 100 coins is making her way around the map.

the star was right in front of her at the crossroad. 

as she approached the crossroad to pick up the star, i sarcastically suggested she go right.

which she immediately did.

i have never seen anyone so angry in my life, and i've worked both as nightclub security and loss prevention in my time. nor have i ever been so afraid. she ended the game with 0 stars...

""i will kill you in your sleep"" she stated.

the rest of the game was spent in dread. its now 3am and i'm hiding in the bathroom typing this while she makes serial killer noises.

goodbye.

tl;dr mario party 7 is a terrible game.",4
"by putting a googly eye in my ear 12 years ago and realising its still there today.... when i was 7 ,about 12 years ago, me and a few of my buddies here playing pretend as spies on the bus home from school. so spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and i thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  i had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.
the googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until i had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out i pushed it even further in. i was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. i could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, i stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. after a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

skip forward to this tuesday;
i do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and i was submerged under water, after i emerged and pulled my boat out i could hear a slight rattle in my ear and i knew instantly what it was.
it's now friday and the rattling happens every time i turn my head and i still haven't build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.

tldr: put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... it didn't

uptate:
so this got alot of traction and a good few fellas are posting that they don't believe it, which is fair enough cause i think it's abit mental aswell.

however i'll get a doctor's visit sorted by the end of this week hopefully and i'll get some photos up onto the sub in an update post.

alot of people are saying about getting my ears checked up yearly and i can honestly say i don't have yearly checkups or have had an ear exam by an actual doctor, someone correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think they're as big of thing in the uk.

thanks for hearing me out",4
"by buying a used playstation 2 on letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.. this happened only minutes ago.


the graphics card in my old ps2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so i decided to replace it when i had a little extra cash. i was out browsing different sites like craigslist and the like, when i stumbled upon the ps2 mentioned in the title. it looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


at the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


now, i should preface this by saying that i have a strange faith in the honesty of others. benefit of the doubt and all that noise. after all, the car i drive now is one i bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. why should this be any different?


starting to sound like a mistake yet?


if the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. that is almost certainly about to change. the model the seller advertised on letgo was one of the larger black brick models. like, the first generation ones. when i finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. when he showed me the goods, it was actually one of the slim and silver ps2's from later in the console's production run. he told me he had already sold the larger one.


my first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that i should have walked away when i saw i was being sold something that was improperly advertised. unfortunately for me (and i guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), i was not in the most logical mood. it was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. i just wanted to get this thing and go home.


back at the ole ranch, i hooked up the console, slapped in kingdom hearts ii, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. i'm off work and done with class, what else would i do with my evening, right? i was pretty happy with my life until i realized i had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. strange, but not altogether discouraging. i slapped in another game that i new for sure was working. didn't read. i repeated this several times with discs i knew would work; same story.


now i'm starting to get slightly pissed. i'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


i open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. i've now got no way to contact him. of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. all i could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. that, or i could get onto youtube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. i picked the latter option and went on my merry way. after a video about a quick mod i could make to the system, i was feeling pretty confident that i was going to get the last laugh on this one.


oh golly gee fuck was i wrong.


now at this point, i begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. i manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. it's putting up a little more of a fight than i saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? it was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. with a little elbow grease, it starts to give. i'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. a bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so i can live with that. the further i get it open, the more rust i see on some more critical pieces. i'm sweating again, but holding out hope. finally, the plastic casing comes free, and i experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


i experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


you see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. the first thing i notice is that the inside is covered in rust. the second thing i notice is that some of the rust is moving.


oh, that's not all rust.


*ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


do you know that scene in raiders of the lost ark where indiana jones is like, ""snakes. why did it have to be snakes?"" that was me. except with cockroaches. they are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. and now they're crawling on my hands. and these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. i threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


they're getting everywhere now. i'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. you would think that something caught fire with the way i was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. tiny, $25 freaks of nature. eventually i managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point i grabbed a can of raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


at least, i *hope* i finished the job. i'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point i'm a little too emotionally drained to care. i also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that i *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and i already need a stiff drink.


tl;dr: i bought a used ps2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.

edit: hi, reddit! i just wanted to say many thanks for the gold and all the offers for cockroach-free playstations!  warms my heart, and i'm super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. happy redditing!",4
"by making myself an uncle nsfw. so this started 2 weeks ago

i went to my mom's house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a gf.

 naturally i start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn't exist, very cliche stuff. i get to teasing him about him not losing his v card, my mom is not liking the conversation. his gf ends up coming over, i stopped the teasing i'm not a monster. so i'm talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she's a half decent girl says she's throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. i tell her not to worry about it i'll talk her into letting my brother go out.

i get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. my argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised ying and yang i grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. he grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. saying how a party would be good for him i even offered to go, (i'm only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, i told her he's old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn't want him to make that mistake (i know how that sounds). so i finally convinced her she agreed.

so i decide that i need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. i knew my bro was losing it that night. fast forward to the party, i drop him off so my mom thinks imma be there. i pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he's hung over not wanting to answer. 

skip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she's pregnant and going to keep it. well holy fuck did i get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  so now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and i'm becoming an uncle.

tl;dr convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his v card, he got his gf pregnant. 


update 1: so she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. so we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. i'm on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. my brother is getting tested for sti's i was all over him about that. also thanks for the gold and silver (i have no idea what that does). thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. 

update 2: everyone is asking for an update, can't really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. my brother does not have any sti's or std's my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,i'm helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. there are quite a few of you wondering what the ""teenage gang stuff"" was you can dm and i can explain what i did if curious, how i got out, how my life has changed and all. 

update 3: *in maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! mother is crying brother is in shock and the gfs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. everyone pray for this child. 


update 4: they are keeping the kid, mom still doesn't talk to me, i helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. i've started a savings account for him, and my gf and i are going to move into a place with him and his gf to help them out.",4
"by telling someone he had something on his trailer dragging. happened this morning, about 5 hours ago. 

i was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. i noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.

normally, i wouldn't think twice about it, but i was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. 

we pull up to a stop light, and i hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. apparently he didnt see me, because when i said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. 

being one who didn't want to escalate the situation, i let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. 

as i turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. the way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. 

as i'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. it didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. 

she then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as i'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. the way she viewed it, i was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. 

the cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. 

tl;dr i stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car

edit: to all the people saying trucks often drag chains, this wasn't a semi or tanker truck. it was just a couple dudes hauling their excavator to a dig site in a ford f-350",4
"by applying for jobs for the past month as ""titty boobowitz"". i've been a self-employed confectioner for the past two years and i recently started trying to get back into one of those fancy jobs with an office thingy again. i should also mention that for almost ten years i've used the same handle across multiple social media platforms. it's by no means a secret identity, but it's also not explicitly connected to my real name. or so i thought. i had been happily emailing my resume and cover letters to many potential employers when i received this email from one that i was particularly excited about:

***i have to say when ""titty boobowitz"" appeared in my inbox i got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***  

***i look forward to reviewing your application and will be in touch shortly.*** 

ooops. my stomach fell right out of my ass when i read that. and of course the most recent thing i had tweeted was just a stream of swear words. i tried to do damage control, but i did not have high expectations. today i finally received the follow up ""you're not moving on to the interview process"" email.  

tl;dr: somewhere along the line while i was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to titty boobowitz in gmail and i never noticed. then i attempted job hunting. no wonder i got no responses.

edit: just because i didn't make it clear - i emailed a gracious response to the person who does the hiring to let her know that it was my unintentional, embarrassing oversight and i appreciated the heads up. we had a warm back and forth, it was a positive experience overall. i'm relieved to know that this kind of thing happens to tons of idiots like me. at least i didn't put ""attention to detail"" anywhere in my resume.

"by inhaling my tongue ring, ending up pregnant and almost dead.. this is still occurring but it started last week and that day started normal like always, i went to work and when i went to lunch it turned to the worst week of my life.  i was sent on lunch and while i was eating my tongue ring somehow came off and instead of what i initially thought was me swallowing it, the xrays at the hospital showed it was inhaled and went into my lung.   since they had to do an x-ray and a cat scan, i was asked if i was pregnant, i told them absolutely not.  since i have the paraguard iud implanted(birth control).  they did blood work and then came to speak to me and told me that i was in-fact pregnant!  i was absolutely shocked and scared, i called my husband and my mom and told them the news, my husband rushed to the hospital and when he got here he asked if i told them about the iud which i had not yet.  when he told them they said after they performed the  bronchoscopy, they would have to immediately remove the iud. the procedure was really simple and they removed the tongue ring in 30 minutes and i was fine for the most part other than a sore throat.  they came and spoke to me about the pregnancy and the problems the iud can present to it, they immediately removed the iud and told me that it was bent and slipped down which is the reason it didn't work properly after me having it for more than a year.  they also scheduled a ultrasound, when they went in for the ultrasound they couldn't find the pregnancy which raised some concerns, ultimately after two days of waiting in the icu they confirmed it was an ectopic pregnancy, they said the pregnancy was very early so they sent me home with a shot to kill the pregnancy and i was to follow up every two days at a clinic to make sure the pregnancy was being successfully terminated.  everything was alright and even though i had cramps and all other sorts of side effects as long as they weren't too sever i would be fine.  i was feeling completely better saturday morning, but after a shower i suddenly felt a sharp pain on my shoulder and then sever abdominal pain that left me incapacitated, i've never felt such severe pain, after speaking to the clinic through the phone they told me to immediately head to the er, when i arrived they performed an ultrasound which almost made me pass out from the pain and they confirmed my pregnancy burst inside my ovary and i was bleeding internally, so i'm now back home but after the worst weekend of my life i'm left out of work for at least 6 weeks and struggling to get out of bed.  they said if i had not come in i would be dead. luckily the doctors were able to save my ovary.  

tl:dr   inhaled my tongue ring, got diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, the pregnancy burst in my ovary and almost killed me.",4
"by not paying attention to my wifes bathroom usage.. this came to a head on sunday night. i've been married for a bit, we had that lovey dovey time, super close, so cute it would a puppy look like a shiftless hobo by comparison. my wife would always leave super early for work, but thats fine. some people like getting to work early and it seemed to fit that she would be the type to do that.

then she started having to run errands at night for some reason. she would either leave like 2 hours early for work or go run errands at like 10. this was fine for a few weeks. then she started coming home with none of the supplies we she said she needed. i dont know why she needed milk or bananas urgently at 10pm, but it raises red flags when you urgently need milk at 10 and then you return with no milk. that this had been going on for months probably doesnt bode well for my entrance for the worlds smartest man competition, which is something i assume that smart people have. i wouldnt know.

my mind jumps to affair. the love of my life is out gallivanting around with some shit bag, probably with a cool name like devin and a magnum dong. stupid devin. i figured i would test this theory by offering my own dong to her the next time she had to take a late night errand run. i basically fell short of presenting it to her on a silver platter. she declined, said maybe when she gets back. like i wanted devins sloppy seconds. so i follow her. there is a dennys down the road from our house. she gets out and goes in. im in my car, imagining how im going to put the pain on this slick jerk while berating my wife. i go inside and i cant find her. nowhere to be seen. its just me, the dennys hostess and a bunch of drunk devins. she finally comes out, and has a shocked face. ""how can you do this to me!"" the fact that i wasnt immediately asked to leave the dennys should tell you all you need to know about dennys. my wife starts sobbing and apologizing. ""you're caught, where is the guy?."" ""what?"" ""dont do this right now, where is the guy?"" ""there isnt a guy."" ""why are we at dennys if there isnt a guy."" at this point it became clear we werent going to be having a meal of microwave steak or whatever it is they serve at dennys so we are asked to leave and not come back. in the parking lot, sobbing continues and i have no idea whats going on. ""wife.......why are you at dennys at 10pm if you arent cheating with a guy.....is it, the hostess?"" ""i had to use the bathroom."" uncontrolled sobbing. ""what....you had to what?"" ""i had to go to the bathroom."" ""we have a toilet, in the home we share."" ""i dont go when you are there ok, i dont like it, i cant relax with you there."" ""a dennys, a dennys bathroom, thats better to you than going, at our home, with me present?"" memories and oddities start flooding in, our honeymoon where she kept going to the lobby to ask for things, innumerable amount of times she would leave at weird times to run errands, the gas station, the store. i just never noticed, never second guessed it. she stopped bringing stuff back because for a long time she would get bananas. so many bananas in our house i guess i mentioned it, so she just stopped grabbing anything. her  shame was brought down by bananas. i could have been blissfully unaware, living in a banana filled house that i and i alone used the bathroom in if not for that comment. so, thats the story of how im not allowed in dennys because i thought she was cheating on me with devin.

tl;dr my wife had an affair with a dennys toilet

edit. thank you to whomever decided to award my idiocy and my wifes shame with gold.

edit 2. for the people asking for proof of my wife pooping.....what the hell is wrong with you. you are devin to me now.

final edit. this was posted this afternoon, at 9:31 pm, after reading the comments she asked me to play video games, announced she was going to go buy bananas and turned on every faucet we have while locking herself in the bathroom.",4
"by swallowing my little sister's birthday present. i am so beside myself with shame that i almost couldn't bring myself to post this. 

but reddit karma is my mistress and i must heed her sweet call. 

so yesterday was my sister's birthday (this fu didn't happen today, yadda yadda), i was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

""look what mom gave me,"" said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

now, i cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. i looked at that ring in my hand and i just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a bugs bunny cartoon. my primitive ape brain said ""funny joke!""

so i did it.

i think it was the next split second when i saw the horror in my sister's eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that i realized what a horrible mistake i had made. 

so my little sister runs screaming from my room and i hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as i admitted that i, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister's ring. no, i didn't know why i did it. yes, i am an idiot. no one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

so brief intermission from my sister's birthday as i make a quick excursion to the er, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them i was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. they took a couple x-rays and i hung around the er for about 8 hours before they broke the news that i was going to live (much to my mother's chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

i shat out the ring this morning. 

happy birthday sis. 

tl;dr: i am an idiot and i ate my sister's ring because i thought it would be funny. 

edit: good fucking god my inbox. tune in tomorrow morning and i'll share a picture of the accursed ring

edit 2: no, not a picture of it covered in shit.

edit 3: front page!! we did it reddit. here's the the divine artifact, as promised(https://imgur.com/gallery/pva6zvh). may it's legend be told for many generations to come.

"almost eating my cousin out in her office. (update at bottom!)

this happened yesterday. i can't wait until it's much further away than that.

so this is a throwaway, i have \*(had) another account where i like to post nudes of myself. that can be your judgement, and why i do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but i do. as a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies i get are from guys. but occasionally i get replies from girls who frequent these subs. my face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. just my... ya know, body.

so i had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. she said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. a lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

she is from a large city on the other side of the country as i am, but conveniently i was traveling there next week (this week). we started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. she worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. this idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. we decided i would carry an envelope and say its for office ""xxx,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. no names needed.

most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared waaay too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. we literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. and lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

so along comes yesterday, the big day. i'm so worked up. she's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. shows me that she is already masturbating. etc. oh lord, etc. i text her and tell her i'm in the building. i get to her office, my heart is racing but i'm beyond excited. i see the receptionist, tell her i need a signature from office ""xxx"" and she points me in the right direction. as i walk up, i see the name on the door. my cousins name. my first cousin, who i have known my whole entire life. my cousin, who i spend every holiday with and am very close with. it can't be, i think.

so i knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. and she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. i just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""heyyyy cousin, i was in town and thought i'd stop by!"" she is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""omg cousin!"" and gets up to hug me. i literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. she tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

i race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. she surely thinks this guy ghosted her, i really don't think she thought it was me. maybe i read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. i'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. i don't know really though. i texted her later and told her i was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. we're supposed to get a drink tonight. i'm petrified and don't know how in god's name i will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  it's hard to reply to all of the comments, so i'll say some stuff here.  she works for a very large company in a very large city.  she told me what floor to go, i honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    i do know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if i wanted.  like i said, it's a big company, and not a shock that i could pop in.

yes she is on reddit but i highly doubt she will see this post.  she told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  headed out for drinks now.  wish me luck guys.  i think i'm going to be honest.  i don't know.

edit 3:  well, first of all, id like to address everyone calling bs on this.  it seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  i agree and would call bs reading this also.   i can't really defend it or prove it (or can i?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, i could give a shit!)

• she doesn't have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

• she lives in nyc, it's big.  the buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. it didn't occur to me, i guess i was worked up.

• i come here often, it's not that i didn't call her, but sometimes when i'm here she'll dm or comment on my insta story and say ""hey come by and visit next time""

• in our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  there was no door man or anyone else i needed to get past.  i don't know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.

• we didn't actually say ""hey cousin"" lol, i'm just censoring our names for the post.

• yes guys post nudes to reddit, i would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)

• i'm 35, she's 26.

• i deleted my account after freaking out, but i'm sure i'll post again and i'll let you know lol.



oooookay, so now onto drinks.

i decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn't fucking focus on anything else.  and as many of you guessed, she knew. she didn't buy the ""i just popped in"".  she figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that i knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  i assured her i didn't, it was really weird.  we slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  we complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  we talked about if we actually did anything, it's a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  and then we had another drink.  and then i licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  i stroked myself while i did it, and after i made her cum she helped me out.  we promised we would never do this again, but i think we'll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.


tl:dr - post nudes on reddit, girl replies with elaborate sexual fantasy, go to act out fantasy and realize girl is my cousin.",4
"by identifying my friend's father's penis and ruining dinner. happened about a week ago, but i've been hesitant to post this as i wasn't sure if it really fits. no one involved in this story is a minor. tl;dr at bottom.

i am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. there are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. we were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iphone. she was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.

""what?"" the collective asked.

""there's some dude's dick here!""

we gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). we laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. we looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. we also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. we couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.

before i turned the setting off, everyone using my family icloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos i saved to my phone. this got annoying after my mom started questioning things i had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so i turned it off.

without thinking of the consequences, i asked her if she shared an icloud account with anyone. she said she shared one with her parents. she got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.

i've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. the rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. we sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.

the image is burned into all of our minds. i've never met her father but i'm terrified one day i will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and i'll know exactly what his penis looks like.

tl;dr: friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, i can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through icloud, and now none of us are okay.

edit: clarifying the tl;dr

edit 2, electric boogaloo: why on earth is this on the front page of reddit. also thanks for the silver

edit 3, freud enters the chat: since like half of the comments are ""why would you cry from seeing your dad's dick"":

* we are all americans and nudity, esp with your family, is more taboo for us
* we are assuming these were taken in a sexual connotation, which isn't really how we like to think about our parents
* it wasn't crying like oh my god what will i do, it was more a mix of laughter and crying like ""i can't believe this is what just happened""

edit 4, the (provable) finale: i'm not posting a picture of this man's penis you nasties",4
"by bodyslamming a girl who wanted to hug me.. i was in a new high school with absolutely no friends whatsoever and because i was very socially awkward i tried to avoid any direct confrontations with any individual whatsoever so i never really made any friends.

however in my fourth block there was this girl who i just seemed to have clicked with because out of all the students in the entire building she was the only one i really actually talked to. skip a couple of weeks i'm coming into my class when she decides to greet me with a friendly hug. 

in this moment i was completely frozen because i never really physically interact with anyone, especially females. so in this moment, i go full brain dead and as she's approaching me with open arms i decided i was going to try and be funny and pick her up from her waist and throw her over my shoulder (don't ask why i thought this would be funny, because i honestly have no clue what the fuck i was thinking) but the second she sees me go down and try and pick her up i could just see the complete and udder confusion in her face as she was just simply wanting a quick hug, but as i pick her up just to make things ten times worse, i shout,

""wwe supah slammmm!!"" 

and she's screaming and for some reason my heart just dropped realizing what i was doing and instead of lightly setting her down, i just fucking drop her and she slams right into a cluster of desks making this massive crashing sound in the middle of the room. i went to ask her if she was okay but she started crying her eyes out basically asking me what the fuck was wrong with me.

tl;dr i shouldn't be allowed around people.",4
"by fulfilling a cuckolds fantasy. obligatory this is a throwaway and this happened last winter yada yada yada.

&#x200b;

i had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but i still swiped out of boredom. they were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. only boob. there was no picture of her husband. i take a few shots and message them.  after like an hour of talking, i decide to just do it. we never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. she wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. at first i was like really not for it, i originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and i was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. at 2am i left the house, and this is where i regret everything.

&#x200b;

after driving for about an hour, i miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped two of my tires. i'm in a shitty ghetto town that i've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how i'm getting home now. i thought i was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. but since there was no turning back now, i decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

the husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as i see him, my gut and inner voice are screaming at me, don't do this, turn back. and i wish i had listened. for reasons unknown, i followed him into the house. it was pitch black, not a single light was on. he lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. i was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. if there was ever a time i disassociated, it was then and there. it was no longer me behind the wheel. the dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. does anybody remember the scene in blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? that was what i saw. a disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. i was horrified but at the same time, i didn't care. they both fucking stink, that was one of the worst things. the smell took forever to wash off my hands after. months later i'll get a whiff out of nowhere. that disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

i take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking the entire time, like fucking gollum. saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. look at that beautiful pussy. ain't she so fuckin wet?"" nonstop. meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. like i said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, i managed to perform to a degree but i never did finish. it probably didn't help i was wearing a condom but i'm extremely glad i was. the entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""how the fuck am i getting home? this smell is going to kill me. how do i end this? how do i get out of here?""

i decided it was time, i had to get the fuck out of there asap. i told them i couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. they insisted i put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. i just wanted to make it look like i at least tried. if the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. i pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. i stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. i politely reiterated i wasn't going to be able to finish. i blamed it on my tires being popped and i was too tired. they were cool about it, and i quickly gathered my things and left.

i barely had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. so we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. my hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers i took and how many times i washed them. i blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what i did. it took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200b;

tldr; drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

&#x200b;

edit: i'm really glad i was able to make a lot of you laugh, even if it's at my own expense, i'm laughing with you. a lot of you have kind things to say and it means quite a lot, thank you. i hope anybody that can relate to the self destructive mindset finds happiness.",4

"by rubbing my ass into a security guard's crotch... out of habit.. normally, students can beep into my school with an id card.

it's rfid, and pretty reliable, so most people don't take their card out of their wallet or purse, they just hold it near the waist-height reader, wait for the beep, and the turnstile unlocks.

i'm a junior, and i've been getting into the building the same way for years. i keep my id card in my back pocket, so i just bump my butt up against the reader, and then side-step through the turnstiles. that sounds a little weird to write, but i promise it's easy to do in one smooth motion, and i'm definitely not the only girl who gets in this way.

only issue was today, when the turnstile broke and wouldn't lock. as a temporary fix, the security guard was standing by the turnstile in front of the reader, and we were supposed to have our id out to show him as we walked in.

coming in at 8:00am, after years of habit... i was on autopilot.

i approached the security guard, he said, ""id?"" and i nodded at him... and turned around, bumped my ass up against his crotch... and then did it again, slower and more forcefully. (obviously i didn't hear the beep, so i guess my brain thought i wasn't close enough to the ""reader""?)

it all took about two seconds, and when i felt his crotch against my ass instead of the metal turnstile, i suddenly realized what i was doing... but before i could say anything, he had taken a huge step back and started going all ""woah woah woah! miss! i just the need the id, please, not a lap dance!"" and then turned up to the security camera with his hands in the air like he wanted it on record he didn't cause this.

i tried to explain, but he wasn't willing to listen, telling me to just go in... and that's that. couple of other students saw so i'm waiting for the rumor-mill to get back to me.

tl;dr: decided i could bribe my way into school without an id by giving the security guard a lapdance... i was right.",4
"by deleting reddit's #1 top post of all time. happened just now. sorry for my possible slips as english is not my mothertongue. i mostly only lurk around, but this time i decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

i've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. usually when i get depressed at home i start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because i like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

see, since i'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""accounts"" folder and terminating the ones i don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). the thing is i used to have an imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so i decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since i didn't get it by registering at the service directly. i'll omit the details of all the cyber sex i went through with my keyboard and the browser, but i somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so i pretty much forgot about the whole deal. but little did i know.

later in the day i get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. in addition to that i still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. being the total jackass of an idiot that i am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, i decide to google the #1 top reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on imgur (yeah, the one about the senate, with a total of whole damn 310k updoots). i open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise satan himself. of course imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? it can't be this bugged, right? (i hadn't clicked one by then yet). so i click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this tifu.

i'm sorry. i didn't want to. please, forgive me everyone.

"by eating a free gumball..  

i'm 23 years old, and i admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways.

earlier today i was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. during that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, i thought i would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

i checked four candy dispensers; all empty. one last chance. i opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, i find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. without any thought or inspection, i excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. at the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face…someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine's dispenser.

so there i am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as i spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. i'm certain i looked ridiculous, and i'm still brushing my teeth.

tl;dr  i ate a free gumball which turned out to be fucking paintball. wtf",4
"by chuckling away being overpaid.. obligatory ""this concluded today"" - i've been working for uncle sam for about 7 years now. i'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day i received a letter from dfas (the guys who actually pay us) that i was overpaid two whole cents.

silly i thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which i could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, the man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - it was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

laughing it off i taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom i work for and why i should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you f-35), and forgot about it. a month later, two weeks ago i get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address xxxxx, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

now i'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before i ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now i'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. being the class a humorous guy that i am, i send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, i kunted et al myself. i lobe me job."" covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

this was a bad play because apparently feds have no sense of humor.

two weeks later, one week ago i got called into my officer's office. not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, i was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

i'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""me, mind explaining to me why i received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

""uhh.. well sir, they spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so i thought i'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. patriotism, y'know sir?""

""well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - we need these floors clean for reason and were looking for a class a go-getter to clean them.

apparently captains have no sense of humor either.

until tonight, i've been spending my free time mopping a lot of floor space.

thank you army. i will never forget you.

tldr; army overpaid me 2 cents, i paid them back three and had to mop floors for their fuckup because feds have sticks up their asses by birth.",4
"by wearing a halloween costume to school. this is a case of me being a chronic dumbass.

i thought that because it was halloween today that other people in a normally holiday loving school would wear at least a prop or one of those bouncy antenna headbands with pumpkins or ghosts but nope!

not a soul.

nobody wore or did anything to celebrate. i know it is a holiday that you eventually grow out of but since costumes are my passion i spent months on a bright orange pirate coat and made a costume to go underneath. i'm not usually the extrovert and due to a few recent unfortunate events and my shitty mental state i'm only at school like 50% of the time, and i thought ""maybe this time i can have a bit of fun just this once"" but fate had other plans for me on this rainy halloween.

its safe to say i was embarrassed and felt bad and surrounded and like a freak.

if i see someone else with a costume on i might feel better but this was overkill, i'm in 11th grade and thankfully because of that i likely wont be made fun of but costuming will always be my passion and someday i will feel okay being the only one in a crowd of people.

"by looking up my school bully. so a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when i was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. i struggled like hell because i didn't speak a single word of english. the school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while i was there). anyway, i tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. one guy just completely hated my guts from day one. no idea why or what i did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. so that's he kind of person i'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my english in class, in front of the teachers and all. there was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while i was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. i naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. when to leave school and which exist to use. where to sit in class etc. once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. i just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  the only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. i would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. karma has to work right? the world can't be that unfair. 

fast forward 15 years. i haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. i didn't make any friends and i didn't develop stockholm's. i looked him up on facebook. 

he owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. he lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. he is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. this has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and i just can't get over the bullshit i was fed, karma will get him for you. i think karma missed.

"by being oblivious to the notes my fiancee has been writing me.. obligatory ""it's 7 am. this didn't happen today, but very recently."" i have been packing a lunch for work for about the past two months. i pack it usually, but if i'm behind schedule, my fiancee will sometimes help or do it for me.

i got home from work, and we were talking about how the day went. she asked me how lunch was, and i told her it was good and thanked her again. after a pause, she kinda laughed and said ""did you like the note today?!""

puzzled, i told her i didn't know what she was talking about. she said ""the note. the one i put it your lunch today."" i told her i didn't see a note. but the way she said ""today"" made it feel like this wasn't the first time. i said ""wait. have you written me a note before?""

she said ""yes. have you never seen them?"" so apparently this is the 9th note she has written on a napkin, and i've thrown every one in the trashcan at work.

"by stripping in front of my girlfriends bff's nsfw. it's as stupid as it sounds.

yesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her bffs. they usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.

around that time i'm usually at the gym so to not disturb them. but yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so i went there an hour earlier.

sometimes after i come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.
so i come home early and hear the tv running and i assumed, that she didn't hear me.
that's when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.

i busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.
her best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. some get red and look away, some stare at me like they've never seen a man's privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved wtf. 

the silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. i uttered a loud fuck and she instantly replied with: „good plan, bad execution."" her friends all laughed and even i had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.

i even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.

"by labeling the breast milk in the fridge ""freshly squeezed titty juice"". the repercussions happened today, the labeling of the titty juice was done yesterday.

my wife and i have a newborn and we've been calling her breast milk 'titty juice' from the moment it came out.  we found it funny and as we're finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.

while i was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  that rest was very short lived.  the baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...

when she read ""freshly squeezed titty juice 21/07/2019"" she lost her got damn mind.  she woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  raised with no manners or respect.  she then left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back.

my wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  she passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.

i didn't get upset because i'm not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.

tl;dr  i labeled the breast milk a crude and offensive name.  now i have an even more tired, emotional and pissed wife to come home to who may have lost some extra support... and a mother in law who thinks i embody everything that's wrong with western culture and parents these days.",4
"by putting a rock in my ear, then leaving it for roughly 13 years.. bit of context; i was a fairly dumb, nine year old at the time this happened. i'm 26 now. 

well it begins at a small-ish, outside, family gathering on my dad's side, (my parents split up some few years earlier, and my mom had primary custody) and i had spaced myself from the other children and took up refuge beneath the adult table. it's where i got to hear all the awful rumors and jibberjabber, so why not, right?

while i sat amongst rubble and dirt, i had this amazing idea to put pebbles in the ridge of my ear now and again, and treat them individually like a car on a racetrack.

again, i wasn't bright. 

well. i drove one of them bitches right into my ear canal.

that said, i flipped out at the idea that this object slid into my ear, and suddenly i can't remove it. not a single adult was even aware i was under the table by this point,  because of course all the brats were locked in the backyard.

so when this screech of terror left my mouth, all that was heard otherwise would've beeen knees against the table and dining-ware clattering.

i lost my mind.

my dad yanked me up and immediately took me to the bathroom and started the hydrogen peroxide treatment to the ear, assuming it was just a panic attack, and that it was earwax agitating my ear drum or something. probably not the most keen reaction, but the thought process was sound. whatever really.

either way, after what seemed like hours, him, his mother, brothers, and sisters reassured me it was fine, saying it probably fell out and that i was overreacting.

okay. sure.

let's skip ahead a bit, it was roughly a two year span between 14 and 16, and i'm in highschool.

this is where the real fun begins. equalbrium (equilibrium) issues immerge, sprinkles of lost balance mostly. i could no longer submerge my head in water for more than a few seconds, high and low pressures made me sick. plus general discomfort over little things like showering, sleeping, traveling. was a nightmare, really.

i get to thinking about things, and grab a simple paperclip then bend it straight, putting a little loop on the end before fishing around my ear for that ""imaginary rock"" i had long ago forgotten.

all i hear is scrapes.

scrrch, skkkrt, shhhhh'sh.

i'll admit, i immediately started to panic before running off to my mom, who rightfully rushed me to hospital while demanding why she hadn't been told up until now. that's another topic entirely.

well wouldn't you know, though? the doctor said i was faking, examined my ear, and said i just had compacted earwax and was likely trying to get out of school. right. it was probably june at the time.

my mom didn't really believe him, but i decided ""balls to it. let's get some hydro-perox!"", because fuck hospitals really.

skip along the years a bit more, i'm 18 and i know for a fact there is something in-my-fucking-head. i'm losing it. so i hit the hospital again, and this time the doctor outright states, ""there's definitely blockage. i'm not sure if it's a rock, but i can certainly try to help.""

so this professional, pulled out this gnarly looking pair of scissor-hemostats and gets to just.. having his absolute way with my ear canal, trying to get a grip on this smooth object. it was audio torture, hands down. rubbing steel to granite, but centimeters from your eardrum and this went on for at least four minutes, until my ear began to bleed lightly.

the end results? ""you'll need to see a specialist"", the specific type eludes me, but basically it was the same guy that removes peanuts from toddler's nasal cavities.

i'll admit right now, my choices here forward were dumb as all hell.

the sight of my ear bleeding sent me off the deep end, and i began refusing all help entirely; only trying to remove it myself from that point on and truthfully just torturing myself when i reflect back.

let's time jump one last time. i'm 22, couple months away from 23, i have a wonderful girlfriend, things are great, but headaches have developed and are a reoccurring thing, however my balance issues have been basically been worked out. great.

but now, out of the blue, i'm losing hand-eye coordination. well damn, you know? i attributed it to the rock in my fucking skull.

i lost it yet again, and went on a rampage this time, demanding my girlfriend give me all her dental and dermal tools so that i could dig this chunk of earth out myself.

three different sized hooped, still sticks, a couple of mirrors, a flat ended rod and a hooked stick. but that last one was phased from the situation immediately.

this was the beginning in some sense, to my 20 minute conquest to become a pro- surgeon, and i locked myself away to be alone; working and prodding these weird little hooped rods around in my ear, mostly loosening wax and grinding against the round sides of the, admittedly small, stone.

eventually the rod's end slipped absurdly close to my ear drum, and wrapped around the rock. in an instant i froze but my heart began pounding through my chest.

jackpot.

now, you see, this is a difficult feeling to explain in person, let alone through text.
the pain from pulling this earwax lathered object from my ear canal was like.. a migraine shifting from my left ear to my right, while in the same sense it felt like i was passing a kidney stone from my skull.

all in all, 2/10. wouldn't do again.

but now it's totally out and i have it put away in a ziplock bag.

i had no real recovery issues i guess. as soon as the rock was out, my hearing was incredible in the one ear!.. for an entire day. now it just rings occasionally.

my balance won't ever be the same i feel, but it's fine enough as is. otherwise, underwater swimming is a no-go, i have minor sensitivity to changing atmospheric air-pressure still, and i get occasional headaches around the right side of my head.

not a bad trade out.

**_edit_**: for everyone calling me an idiot, trust me i know. for everyone concerned about my follow through, it was 3 years ago and i've been to the hospital between then and now for basic check-ups and have mentioned the stoned-ear before. it's fine. this is why i can laugh it off.

**_another edit_**: 9yrs old at the beginning, 22 at the removal. had to check a few timestamps.

i'm currently 26.

also, spelling

tldr: i put a rock in my ear at 9yrs old, went to two doctors, one didn't believe me, the other couldn't help. pulled it out myself after 13 years when i was 22 and now i can't swim underwater, storm cells give me minor headaches, and i have poor balance.",4
"by accidentally buying tickets to the red hot chili pipers not peppers. few years back i was a bit drunk and saw online that the ""red hot chili pipers"" were playing in edinburgh...i thought it was the red hot chili peppers! £30 for a ticket i thought it was a bargain! bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time).

i am a huge fan of the red hot chili peppers and i was super stoked to finally see them in edinburgh! most bands play in glasgow so i couldnt believe my luck when i saw they were playing in my city!

so we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then i heard some bagpipe music was playing.

i thought hmm interesting...not what i expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in scotland and the capital city i really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

about an hour in i was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but i was waiting for the red hot chili peppers to come out so i could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

i turned to the man next to me and asked when the red hot chili peppers were coming on he laughed and said ""aye pal good joke eh""

it was at this moment i realised i was not going to see the red hot chili peppers.

tl;dr: bought tickets to the red hot chili pipers thinking it was the red hot chili peppers.

"by making a grown man cry at my work. i debated whether or not this belongs here cause it's more or less just me being an awkwo-taco. but my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. 

sidenote: this happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.

i work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. i had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. he was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes i get who tend to speak down to me just because i'm a girl who works in a hardware store. anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn't have a receipt so i said i could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. he agrees and he opens his wallet and i notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. trying to make conversation i decide to comment on it:
(op: me | og: old guy)

op: oh is that your granddaughter? she's so cute!

og: oh no... that's my daughter.

*fuck, i basically just implied this guy was old.*

og: oh cool! she's really cute! what grade is she in?

*guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*

og: she's dead. she was hit by a car. a week after the picture was taken 

in my mind i fucking panicked. i literally didn't know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. and this is what i came up with:

op: oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! it's too bad she died!

the guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. in record time i get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, ""have a nice day!"" and he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.

guys. 

i told him ""you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter"".

and that, ""oh geez, sucks that she's dead!"" that's what my fucking brain came up with. 
fml.

tl;dr - subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.

**update: holy shit.**

i did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).

to answer a few comments: 
*why didn't you just say 'i'm sorry' and move on?*

because that would of been the smart thing to say and as i have referenced, i am a complete and utter dumbass. also, i am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so i was trying to backpeddle as fast as i could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.

*why would you comment on the kids picture? that's weird.*

yeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. but like i said i am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. this happened when i was still pretty new to the job and i had never worked in retail before so i wasn't really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn't talk about with customers. after this happened i learned my lesson and i have only ever asked how a person's day is going or have made comments about the weather. 

*why do you work in customer service? you clearly don't belong in that department.*

like i said this happened a few years ago when i was still pretty new and i have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. i now train people for the job and i am also a assistant supervisor of the department. i usually tell newbies this story when i am training them so they don't make the same mistake as i did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. 
 
*did you ever apologize to the guy?*

no, and that's the one thing i regret most of all. i've never seen him come back to the store after this happened. i truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.

anyway, thanks for reading my post guys. while i'm sure this made some of your cringe, hope y'all have a good day!

"by suggesting to my bf that he get testicle implants. i've been dating this guy for a few months. he has a fetish for petite asian girls, that i know. but he also has a thing for big breasts, which i attribute to his ""hentai porn"" fascination where women are depicted in strange and inhuman proportions. 

in the past month, he has been making comments here and there about breast implants. he would send me articles on the joys of saline vs silicone implants, for example, and would tell me i'd be ""perfect"" if i got some saline implants to fill a dd cup, as a ""joke"" of course. (dd is not crazy actually because my band size is 30, which is equivalent to a 34c, but still insulting to me.)

so i finally had it a week ago and told him to stop making jokes about implants because they are not funny and insulting. i told him most petite asian women are not big breasted contrary to his hentai fantasy. he did stop for a few days, then today again he mentioned to me how great i'd look in a double d while we were out having brunch. 

so i snapped, and i said well maybe he should get some testicle implants to augment the size of his cherry testicles. well he didn't take my suggestion too kindly and went home in a huff by himself. he hasn't returned any of my texts since. 

tl;dr: i underestimated how fragile my bf's ego is concerning his balls and i insulted him deeply by suggesting he get implants.

edit/update: looks like he is breaking up with me by ghosting. i tried calling him to apologize since he's ignoring my texts and he is sending my calls directly to voicemail. :(

more edit: i'm very sorry if i gave the wrong impression of him here. words are very limited. he really is a good guy otherwise. i know and i hear everyone: he is really foolish in how he expresses his fetish. but i really like him (and his balls big or small!). i did not mean to hurt him this deeply and i'm just so sad right now that i hurt him this much. i feel like a terrible person. i shouldn't have reacted with cattiness that i didn't even mean because i like his balls just the way they are!

"by yelling ""it's boy scouts. get the gun!"". actually, it was my wife and a couple months ago during the boy scouts' popcorn sales (or whatever they are selling this year.) we always buy popcorn or whatever the boy scouts are selling since my son was once a boy scout and was a great salesman and won lots of prizes for his sales. so the boy scouts in the neighborhood can always count on us buying a few boxes from whoever shows up at the door.

we have three dogs. two of them go into a barking frenzy when anyone rings the doorbell. to combat this, we keep a water gun by the door since being squirt a couple of times shuts them right up. one day, the doorbell rings, the dogs go into their frenzy, and my wife notices that the squirt gun is not sitting by the front door but had been moved to the kitchen. so she yells ""it's boy scouts. get the gun!"" to my son in the other room. 

when she opened the door the two boys were about to bolt until they see the small purple water gun in her hand.

tl;dr boy scouts at our front door thought they were going to be met with deadly force.

edit: thanks for all the generosity! dog tax.(https://i.imgur.com/tohmu5r.jpg) they hate being squirt but get into water whenever they have a chance, even in the middle of the winter. spike is the cairn terrier. he's over 15 years old and has never barked at people or the doorbell. pepper is the schnauzer, and a true watch dog since he's a yapping machine. annie was a starving stray we found living under a bridge about 7 years ago. she is likely part basenji since although she barks, especially when pepper instigates her, she mostly whines loudly when she's excited.

"watching incest porn. *throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.*

so, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. of all people. if there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment i look straight into it. i answered the phone. the old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

cut to my dad and i driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. then, there came the silence. it wasn't the awkward kind. but i guess we just kinda said enough at the time. my father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. he was in the mood to get jiggy with jeezy. but instead of hearing voices worshipping the og upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital q&a: 

*""you like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

my old man unknowingly activated the car's bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever i was listening to last. in this case, it was fucking incest porn. now, i never closed the video before i left the house, but i did pause the motherfucker. yet, somehow, my phone went skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

i frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what i do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

dad: suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids. 

me: 

i immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home. 

^^siri ^^might ^^have ^^sabotaged ^^me

**tl:dr drove my dad home. accidentally blasted incest porn over the bluetooth speaker. the end.**",4
"buying my son's halloween candy away from him. my kids go trick or treating. we live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. 

when they're young we tell them santa brings every boy and girl a present on halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he'd leave in exchange. 

when the kids get old enough to realize santa is a hoax, that's when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. 

did this with our oldest two and it worked great. they'd give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. 

our third child is 8 this year so called us out on the santa thing. we explained the new deal. 

he said ""so then it's my money and i can buy *whatever* i want with it? a new skateboard even? *anything*?"" ""you bet."" ""swear?"" ""yep."" 

he goes and brings us **all** his candy. even every kit kat, his favorite. i was shocked, but he'd been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must've decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. 

getting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 i'd spent all week. 

next day i brought the candy to work. then we went to walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. we met at the check out. 

there's my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred kit kats for $10.00. 

i started to tell him to put it back, but he said ""what? you said i could buy *whatever* i wanted! you swore! i want my candy back then."" 

his candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. and i did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. 

so... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. 

i don't know who's more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this. 

*tl;dr i bought my son's halloween candy back from him to get the sugar out of the house. he spent the money on twice as much candy as he had gotten trick or treating.*

edit: thanks to everyone for all these awards!",4
"by dropping off my dog at a kid's summer camp. technically yesterday and not today, but yifu sounds like some odd anime genre so...

so it's summer, which means my 6yo daughter goes to summer camp. i was dropping her off at about 8ish and i was also going to drop my dog off at doggie daycare because the gardeners are coming today and they don't appreciate her trying to protect them from those murderous rakes and lawnmowers. for the record, the dog is a 13 year old black lab / pit bull mix.

anyway, stopped at the summer camp. my daughter grabbed the dog's leash and walked her to the drop off desk to show her to her friends. i signed my daughter in and then i.... just drove off. in my defense, well, i got nothing. honestly, i just forgot the dog there.

so my wife picks up our daughter in the afternoon and is quite surprised to find the dog there with her. apparently, the dog (and the kids) had a great day at summer camp. i now have pictures of my dog participating in such activities as ""paint a rock"" (she did not do very well on this one), ""learning about dinosaurs"" (did not participate) and ""digging for fossils"" (which was right in her sweet spot of digging bones out of dirt). she also enjoyed water activities and apparently stole some snacks. she got a free shirt and we got a picture of her wearing the shirt with her camp team wearing identical shirts. all in all, could have gone worse.

edit - i get it, you want to see pics of the dog at camp.  sorry, but no can do.  pics include other people's kids and i'm not going to post that.  also, i think posting the pic would make it easy for my friends to figure out who this account belongs to and i've said way too much shit i regret on reddit for that to happen.  just use your imaginations.  she's half black lab, half pit although she looks mostly like a lab.  muzzle almost completely white due to being 13.  she's still very active and very kid friendly and water play with a pool and a dozen kids running around with a hose is pretty much her version of paradise.

edit 2 - for those asking.  yes, camp called me.  twice.  and left vm's both times.  number was not one i recognized so i didn't pick up or check vm (i know, tifu!  number is now programmed in).  both messages were very polite and highly amused but they did ask if i could come pick the dog up.  i clearly did not so they just gave up and included her in the day's activities.  and yes, this whole thing could have gone a lot worse.  huge huge props to the camp for making a good thing out of my fuck up.

edit 3 - for those asking.  i did offer to pay for an extra day / kid but they said no.  so i left them an awesome review on yelp and shared their link with friends with a very strong recommendation.

edit 4 - yah, i get it.  this could have gone a lot worse and kudos to the camp for making the best of it.  yes, it was a mistake on my side.  that's why i'm posting it here and not on r/todayiwasawesome

edit 5 - holy crap.  came back to see this hit the front page and my inbox has 500 messages.  i just want to take a moment and say thank you to my mom and dad for having sex with each other and making this moment possible.  

tl;dr - dropped dog off at kiddie summer camp by mistake. dog had a great time and i think she's now a camp counselor.",4
"by complimenting a co-worker on his weight loss. this happened just moments ago.

i have a co-worker that works in a separate department.  in my old position we had to communicate fairly regularly, but since changing positions i rarely see him.  it has been about a year and a half since i have seen him and i was surprised to see him in my area today.  he has lost about a hundred pounds so i thought it would be a nice gesture to recognize and compliment him.  i said it was good to see him again and rather enthusiastically told him he looks great and to keep up the hard work.  he responded with a cold smile, said it was nice running into me, and just continued walking.  we aren't incredibly close but we usually stop for small talk, which i was completely expecting as i awkwardly stood in the hallway.  

when i got back into my office i brought up the weight loss to my office-mate and said our coworker really looked great, and he was inspiring.  my office-mate somberly responded that he was diagnosed with cancer and has been losing the weight because of that.  

tl;dr i enthusiastically complimented a co-worker about his weight loss, got a cold response, then learned he was diagnosed with cancer.",4
"by having my roomate walk in while i was practicing cowgirl riding.... oof

my roommate told me that she was going to be out of town for a week and would be back on sunday night. she usually always follows her schedule and never deviates from it.

a week ago, i ordered a dildo that had a suction cup base, and was roughly the size of my boyfriends. i don't particularly like using my toys when my roomie is home, on the off chance that she somehow hears me or whatever. so this was fucking fantastic and i was ecstatic.

my plan was to use the living room space and use one of my smaller tables, so i could sit on it and act like it was my bf. i'm not really experienced in the sex department and i wanted to make a good show for his upcoming birthday so i was going to practice until she got back.

before i get into the main event. i need to explain the layout of this house. when opening the front door, you walk right into the mud room which has a swinging door that used to squeak, we don't wear shoes in the house only slippers or socks. after leaving the mudroom you're in the kitchen and around the corner and across the hall is the living room.

since the swinging door used to squeak we'd know when someone was here if we heard the noise. however since we got it fixed it's silent.

now on to the main event. i had set up the living room, with my small table in the middle, a chair in front of me to so i could balance and my 'sexy time' music on low, with the lights dimmed. then i pulled out my new toy and i literally smashed that fella on the table and made sure it stuck.

then i got dressed down to what i would be wearing. it was just a long ass tshirt that hit my knees, but underneath i had my lingerie, i did this so i would be in the head space and so i could i imagine the upcoming day.

at this point i'm on the toy and i had a pretty good groove going and i was thinking okay it's not that hard, but my hips were sore so i grabbed some pillows to support, and then i heard a noise. i fucking froze and turned around and it was my cute pupper! i shoo'd him out and continued.

another couple minutes go by and i can hear my dog get the zoomies and playing with her toy running back and forth with it. until i realized, that how the fuck was she fetching something she can't even throw. i then heard the suitcase rolling from the kitchen to the hallway and i felt my entire body flush and get immediately sweaty and my heart rate skyrocket. i heard the suitcase stop and when it did i hopped my body off and grabbed the dildo to pull it off, but that fucker didn't budge. i was doing some mad calculations in my mind to try and explain this...

lightbulb!

my shirt is long enough, my unides are crotchless and she'll never be able to tell! i sat myself right back down, turned the tv on rick and morty, put a pillow up on the fucking chair and acted like i had been watching this the entire night.

she came in and saw me and asked why i was sitting like that and i made some bullshit up saying my back hurt and i was just letting it stretch out. she nodded and then plopped her ass on the couch. now this would've been okay, if it wasn't for the fact that i was sitting on a dildo and leaning forward in a position that was starting to get uncomfortable.

we sat there for 2 hours and she never even got up. she told me she came back early since she finished up her work early and we chatted for a bit until the show ended and then she picked the handmaids tale.

at this point i'm so sore and by sheer will i'm keeping it together, because this would be incredibly awkward at this point to get up and act normal.

the moment comes when she says she's hungry and ask if we want to order in. i reply with gusto and tell her to run up stairs and grab our menue folder in her room. she does and as soon as she's on the first step up,  i pop off this joint and sprint my ass down the hallway to my room and place the table in my closet and get the stubborn dildo off and toss it in my shower.


tl;dr: tried to practice my cowgirl riding on a dildo, and forced to sit on it for two hours, until my roomate left to get our menu folder.

update 1: thanks so much for the lovely gold! it's my first one and it makes me happy! for the record, i am sore, and it's a bit uncomfortable. i haven't told my bf yet since i'm still a bit embarrassed! but i'm planning on telling him on the day. also, my roommate had no idea, because there's no way she'd pass up to joke about it.

update 2: since it's being asked alot, the reason i was not in my room was because at the time it was messy. i was rearranging and packing up some of old stuff. so there were boxes and all that jazz.

update: i tried keeping up with all the comments... i give lol my pupper has been posted in r/aww",4
"by swiping on lesbians on tinder for 2 months.. this has been going on for two months and i just found out today. throwaway account because many know my real account and i don't feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. 

so i signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. i set up my account...set my interest in 'women' and started swiping. now when i signed up for tinder i linked my facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if i set my gender to woman. i had completely forgot. i'm not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but i was getting barely any matches and couldn't figure out why. figured the algorithms were just screwing me. over the course of the two months i would think ""wow short hair must be the new thing"" or ""so many bisexuals on here"" but never really thought anything beyond that. then this morning i woke up to a new match. she said i looked great, to which i replied thanks, you too! but then she replied with...""how long ago did you transition?"" i thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. that's when it all came together and i realized i've been swiping on lesbians the entire time.

tldr; my 13 year-old self is an asshole.

edit: i am not 13 years old, that's when i made a facebook. i am 25.",4
"by naming my password recovery answer as 'dong schlong'. this happened about a week ago. it still gives me shivers.

obviously, i never thought this would happen to me of all people.

i spent a lot of money on the app store and i think they blocked my card and so i had to call them up to restore my account.

a female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. even at this point i had no clue what was coming. until she asked,

""what is your most prized possession?""

i froze. my head goes blank not because i forgot what i had written for the answer, but because i knew exactly what i had written. the answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

i wanted to hang up right then and there, but i knew she was looking at the answer i had written.

so, i mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""i'm sorry? you have to speak up sir, i can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (fuck), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (fucking kill me)""

""dong schlong. thank you, sir.""

i was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

i've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and i had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.

edit:

holy mother of schlong this blew up... thank you kind sir/ma'am for the shiny silver!

and yes, looking back, i should've definitely owned it, like one of the comments mentioned. but this had never happened to me and i think i just panicked. i'll remember to be confident about my profane recovery names next time.

gold?? platinum? seriously?? wow, you guys made my day. i'll make sure to keep my shiny medals clean and sparkling :)",4
"by closely following a woman around a lingerie store. this happened just today. i (male) was in a lingerie store with my girlfriend, she was shopping for new underwear and i was just following her around, bored as always, staring at my phone to keep myself occupied.

after about 5-10 minutes a man grabs my arm, i turn and it's the security guard. he asks me to leave and starts escorting me towards the exit. i'm confused about what's happening and look around for my girlfriend, who i can't find.

apparently at some point, while not paying attention to anything other than my phone, i'd stopped following my girlfriend (who was wearing a white cardigan and black trousers) and instead had started following some other random woman who was wearing similar clothes. i'd apparently been doing this for at least a few minutes, silently standing closely behind her as she browsed underwear and following her to do it again as she tried to move away. she'd alerted a member of staff with a horrified look towards them.

tl;dr started following a stranger who i thought was my girlfriend and creeped them out",4
"by asking for vagina in a japanese convenience store. for context, i'm on a vacation to japan and has been staying at my friend's apartment for 3 days. to show a bit of gratitude, i wanted to cook for her so i decided to go for something simple like a chicken katsu.

i've already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. this is the moment i realized that i was out of breadcrumbs so i have to go to the convenience store to get some. i am somewhat decent in japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? no.

as i walked in the store, i couldn't find the breadcrumbs i was looking for so i decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:

me: ""sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?"" which literally translates to ""excuse me, where is da pussy?""

at this point i didn't realize that i mixed ""manko(pussy)"" and ""panko(breadcrumbs)"". the staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking i was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. i repeated the question 3 times, the staff's face switched from being confused to disgusted. after the change of the staff's expression, i realized that i fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. i then explained that i mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.

tl;dr i mistaken the word panko(breadcrumbs) for the word manko(pussy) asked a convenience store staff for pussy",4
"by leaving a dildo on the table and ruining my sons life. this happened saturday night into sunday morning but my shame has subsided enough for me to write this out. also no throwaway because whatever. 

we have a 12 yr old son. 

saturday night after he went to bed, husband and i decided to get a little sex in. after quite a few drinks, we also decided to break out the ""toy"" box. husband leaves the room with a few dildos and says he will be back. (he was putting new batteries in them, etc). he comes back, we do our thing and go to sleep. we wake up in the morning and our son comes into our room and says ""what is that on the table?!""
...i immediately realized the fu. husband did not so he asks ""what is it?"" 
son: a purple banana (ps he's 12 so he knew what it was) and he walks out of the room. 
cue immediate shame/laughter. i wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. 

side note. we did not use that particular ""purple banana"" that night-thank god. 

after we composed ourselves husband goes into sons room and says ""what do you want for breakfast?"" 
son says ""i lost my appetite"" 

i'm still dying inside. i'm sure son is too.

tl;dr left a dildo on the table like a moron, son won't ever be the same.

edit: ok guys-you realize it's 2019, the internet is alive and well, and 7th grade 12yr old boys are exploring etc right?! it's not crazy that he knows what dildos are.

also edit: i didn't treat it like it was shameful and i know i didn't actually ruin his life. but no one wants to think of their parents having sex. we laughed about it afterwards and made purple banana jokes the rest of the day. we are open and communicate etc. i was mortified and still am, because it's embarrassing.",4
"by letting this subreddit devolve into a collection of creative erotica writing assignments meta. i don't know if meta threads are allowed, but i think this needs to be said. i believe the removal of the ""nsfw only on weekends"" rule hurt this subreddit a lot. the majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting tifus that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, tifus that are actually not tifus at all and serve only as humble brags - by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool i am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have >50% posts on this sub.

when you open many of those stories, you have people actually calling op out for the story obviously being fake/barely a (like the guy who almost went down on his cousin and then in an update actually went down on his cousin, like who is actually dumb enough to believe that happened?), so i really doubt i am the only person who thinks the subreddit is regressing.

tl;dr: personally i think the quality of the subreddit would be improved by reinstating the nsfw weekend rule. these post clearly have their audience so i have no problems with them existing at all, and when they were scarce they were indeed actually interesting. however i don't think it's fun to open this sub and seeing the exact same shit every single day.",4
"by going to the gym and immediately pinning myself to the weight bench so severely that i had to be rescued. then i did something really embarrassing.. 


a few years ago i spent a saturday blissfully tripping by myself. i had dosed that afternoon and i started coming down as the sun was coming up. it was a bright, crisp morning and i felt completely at peace. i was shuffling my music and sunday morning by the velvet underground came on. it was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.

i suddenly made a decision. i had to make some changes. i had to get my fat ass to the gym.

i was surprised to see so many people. i had thought, hey, 7am on a sunday, i'll have the run of the place. i was obviously incorrect. all the cardio machines were taken. i couldn't just stand there. i was already getting sweaty and i'd been so high for so long so recently.

i saw an empty bench press and went for it. i couldn't remember what i used to bench back in school so i decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. i am 6'2 and 250 lbs. i was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.

it was heavier than i imagined. i figured my guns were rusty. i decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. it was all i could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. i let it sit on my chest while i came up with a plan. every time i tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. i decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. with momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. perfect. i tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.

*wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*

the bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. i lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. if anyone heard it, they ignored it. despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. it hurt. i slowed my breathing and just relaxed. it'll be ok, i thought. i got this, i prayed.

*brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.

nope, it's bad, this is bad. everyone had to have heard the rounds i let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. the volume was incredible. no one knew i was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. no one laughed. time was frozen but i assume only a few minutes passed. finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. he looked up at me with genuine concern.

""hey man are you alr-""

*popopopopopopop............whhhoooooooot.*

to his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. more like a twitch. i nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. i tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. he left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. all i wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. like i wasn't bothered at all.

so, knowing i was being observed, i did this. i stood tall, nodded to myself like i nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *alright*

**fuck.**

**me.**

the door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. i ran to my car.

i can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. there is nothing funny about the clap. it pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp. i just wanted to look like a normal human being.

tl;dr i went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak i am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until i was rescued. then i pretended i had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *alright* as if i could alter reality by sheer force of will.",4
"by being young and dumb i guess. *i was 16 when this happened. golden age of fuck ups.* 

i hooked up with one of the girls from my church. we were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. i was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the big g. however the two of us shared one common goal. we wanted to fuck. which we did. but afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her ""carnal sins"". she named and shamed both of us. none of this would've been *that* bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father. 

so thanks to that confession, that's how my dad found out his virgin son dipped his doodle in the deacon's daughter. 

*edit: thank you for the silver & gold!* 

*edit: okay, gawd damn. some of you are sick of all the sex posts. noted.* 

*edit: a few of you are asking how my old man reacted. every second or third weekend he dragged my ass to prison, where he would occasionally preach the word of god. being there scared the shit out of me and he knew that. i was forced to listen to ""rehabilitated"" rapists and murderers read scriptures out of the bible and give me lessons on what it meant to be born again and to live a pure life in christ... free from temptation, sin, all the shit 16 year old me was guilty of that time. i never had sex with the deacon's daughter ever again.*

"by falling asleep then waking up while my roommate bought his date back.. this happened many years ago! but it still an experience that brings a few laughs. (tl:dr at the bottom)

back in college, i shared a room with a 4'9 dude and he was nice man. he would always leave everything spotless, he was an amazing wingman and he always managed to make sure that when we had a few people over that they'd all have food readily available and drinks etc. he was so cool. anyway, he told me he was going to have a date and asked if i'd be going to my friends house for the night (he didn't live too far and i had been talking about meeting him one of the days) i was like ""yeah maybe, ohhh i see you want the room tonight i got you don't worry"". so he's all nervous about his date and i give him a pep talk i said ""you're a good man, your dates gonna be great and you definitely look ace!"" he was all hyped up and left. 

i called my buddy and asked if he was at home, he was actually at work. but, he told me he'll be back home within a couple hours or so. now, my roommate who was on his date told me he would ring or text me to let me know he got back safe to the room and to give me the heads up when to leave. 

so, i figured i got plenty of time. i laid on the bed and basically waited for two hours to go by to get a phone call from my buddy to tell me he had finished work. but, i instead get a text message from him saying he had finished work and that he'll be getting home a lot later than expected. still no sign from my roommate on his date though (who said he'll ring/message me if he's bringing his date back)

then *i ended up falling asleep*

again after waiting for my buddy to message me when he's free to meet. after some time passes i begin to wake up a little because i hear some distorted voices, giggling and bed creaking . i'm like ""oh fuck"" he's with his date, him and her are gonna be pissed if i ruin their night now by waking up, ""why didn't he text me or ring?!!"". so, i stayed stationary and pretended to be asleep. i hear them both get outta bed and lay on the floor (i imagine cause of the bed creaking). i then start to hear the almighty thunderous clapping of balls and i'm seriously trying to hold my laughter in _but_ then i i heard moaning like a japanese anime character.. which confused me. anyway at this point i'm still trying to hold my laughter in, i realised i had knocked my phone near the edge of the bed because of my inability to keep my composure, so i decided to try and grab it splinter cell lock picking style. i grab the phone without being noticed and in that moment curiosity got the better of me. the ball slamming stopped and it went quiet so i decided then take a slight peak to see if him and his date was asleep and if the coast was clear.. *nope!* as i opened my eye all i see is a 6'7, huge bald black dude followed by the deepest male voice i've ever heard in my entire life say ""now say you want more now"" and continue the almighty thunderous ball slamming i see my 4'9 roommate getting absolutely destroyed up and down like a goddamn yo yo waving his arms in the sky like when you was a kid and needed a piss but you was in class and you had to raise your hand impatiently to get the teachers attention to go to the bathroom. i again stayed stationary as possible with tears of laughter running down my eyes. all the business stopped and the behemoth of a man left the dorm and my roommate just went straight to bed humming. 

the next day i got up early, showered and decided to get mcdonalds breakfast for myself and my roommate and a strong coffee (believe me, even i felt exhausted after all of that). i come back to the room to see my roommate watching tv as if nothing happened whatsoever. i said ""well tell me about the date? was she nice?"" whilst he grinned and ate his sausage mcmuffin. he just looked at me and said ""it was so much fun we're going to meet again very soon"". 

now, i didn't want to say anything because his sexuality is his business and he'll say when the time was right (he did a month later). so, i said ""i'm glad you had a good time"". as i leave the room and make my way down the hallway, what do i see?? the behemoth black dude walking down hallway with the look of a man on a mission, literally like terminator as he walks through the hallway of the psychiatric hospital. i took a last glance through the window while the dude made his way to my room. so, when my friend said ""we're going to meet again _soon_"" little did i know it would be less than 10 hours from the other night. but at least this time they had all the privacy they wanted and i didn't have to almost die of laughter. 

tl;dr - roommate went on a date, brought back home his date, didn't know his date was another dude, i fell asleep and eventually woke up to see him getting destroyed by a dude the size of bob sapp(https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/071/282/bobsapp_crop_north.jpg?1357083029&amp;w=630&amp;h=420) who came back less than 10 hours later for round two. and i'm 99% certain he ate my mcdonalds hashbrown that i left on the side.

"by fucking my bf into a seizure. i'm going to preface this by saying, no, this didn't actually happen today. it has taken me some time to heal and see the humor in it.

it was our first valentine's day together this year. i woke up super horny and reached over for him, and noticed he was extremely ready to go as well.

i decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. it was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. 

i needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...

this is when things begin to go wrong.

all of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. i glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (he has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)


sure enough, he began to violently seize. i go full protective mode and try to help him. he was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.

we're both still naked and i have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode. 

fight or flight kicks in and i know i must get him on to his side to prevent asphixiation. i'm on the smaller side, being 5'6 and around 125lbs. so when my actively seizing bf (6'2 190lbs) needs to be moved, i go balls to the walls.

i grabbed his arm and pull with all my weight and everything in me and heard a disgusting

*clack*


once he's back to and able to talk, he moans, saying that his arm is killing him, and that he thinks it's dislocated. i drive him to the hospital
and sure enough his shoulder is severely dislocated. i apologized profusely to my man, who responded

""babe you fucked me into a seizure..i'm pretty sure you cannot top something like that.""
so not only, on our first valentine's day together did i literally fuck him into a seizure, but i also dislocated his shoulder. 

tldr: had sex with boyfriend that had a seizure afterwards, tried to turn him on his side and dislocated his shoulder in the processs.",4
"by telling my three year old daughter that i would eat her booty. alright so let's start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you'll be like wtf? 

so my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  and more accurately it's more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife ""mommy, get my booty! get my booty mom"" and off to the races they go. 

obviously this is a game that both parents play and she'll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. this get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it's cute and we haven't gotten any feedback on it.

this brings us to last night. the wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells ""get my booty daddy!"" to which i reply nonchalantly ""i'm going to eat your booty! nom nom nom"" since her butt was right next to my face. 

i immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling ""eat my booty daddy! eat my booty"" and takes off running. dear lord, what have i done?! i try to go into damage control and revert back to get your booty, but it's too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

i took her to daycare this morning, i hope she forgot all about it. i'm dreading picking her up.

tl;dr my daughter yells get my booty to initiate games of tag. with her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face i instead say i'm going to eat your booty! she now yells eat my booty to initiate the game instead. 

edit: a word. also thanks for the gold kind stranger!

there were lots of requests for an update after pickup. all is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. 

thanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them. 

for those that got offended, sorry? none of it was intended and i thought it was a funny anecdote to share. cheers!",4
"by getting in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. so this actually happened about a week and a half ago. some pre knowledge. i dated my next door neighbor for about a year and a half, but then we eventually broke up. so the other day i was really hungry and wanted some panda express orange chicken. i texted my friend to see if he wanted to go get some panda with me and he replied sure but that he wanted to drive because he had gotten a new car and wanted to surprise me with it. i was like ""alright sounds good brother see you in a bit"". 
a couple minutes later a car rolls up in front of my house. so naturally i got went out and got in thinking that it was my friend. i got in and buckled and was ready to go when the driver looked over and said, ""ummm you're not my girlfriend,"" quickly i looked up and realized ""oh god i am in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. i started to unbuckle and get out. i opened the door and heard a thunk. now i'm thinking to myself ""oh god i just hit the door against the curb but when i looked up it turns out i actually hit my ex with the door. quickly i apologized and got out and waited for my friend inside my house.

"by listening to reddit and eating my girlfriends ass, which caused a peanut allergy.. my girlfriend and i have been together for about a year and a half. she is into butt stuff which is fine with me for the most part, but i've always told myself that i would never eat ass. i just think it's unsanitary and just gross. but she's dropped hints here and there that she would like me to do it, but i've always deflected it. i decided i might finally give it a try, maybe it won't be so bad. if it's something she would really enjoy it, why not? but then a concerning thought entered my head.

i have a peanut allergy and my girlfriend loves paydays, the peanut candy bars. there is a vending machine at her work and has one most days during her lunch break. i wasn't sure if it would be safe to eat her ass due to my allergy and her diet. so i decided to ask reddit.

most of the replies said that it shouldn't be anything to worry about, so what the hell, let's go for it.

she gets off work and we start doing our thing and it comes time to toss the ol salad. it wasn't quite as bad as i thought it was going to be considering she keeps herself pretty clean. but after a few minutes, my throat started to get itchy and i could tell that my eyes were swelling up.

i pulled my face out from between her pooper cheeks and told her i'd be right back and ran to the bathroom. this obviously made her very self conscience. i was in the bathroom watching my face swell up for 5 minutes or so and when i came back i looked like will smith from hitched when he eats the seafood. 

i had to explain to her that i was going to be fine (my peanut allergy is not life threatening or anything too serious) but it was a pretty awkward situation. she told me i didn't ever have to do it again, so i guess there's a silver lining to the story.

tldr: i have a peanut allergy, and ate my girlfriends ass after she had a payday candy bar, causing my entire face to swell up.

"by causing an explosion 40,000ft above the atlantic ocean on an international flight.. i was running a bit late for a long-haul flight from delhi to london, so i quickly bought some snacks and shoved them in my travel bag as i ran to the boarding gate.

about 4 hours in (whilst half the people were asleep and the other half were getting annoyed that the tvs had stopped working), there was a massive bang and the whole plane launched into hysteria.

i can't even explain how loud it was, especially given the plane was in near silence. immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. it didn't help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn't see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. the people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.

after a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. my travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.

as it turns out, in india they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don't get crushed. they're also dirt cheap, so i bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks i'd grabbed in a rush earlier). the pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. 

and **that** is how i accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.

tl;dr: i made the mistake of squashing lots of hyper inflated chip packets into my bag on a flight and they all exploded. everyone lost their minds.",4
"by sleeping with my landlord. okay so this happened over the weekend and today. 
on friday, i went to view an apartment. i had talked to the landlord on the phone and was seeing the apartment with the super. 
so i see the apartment, everything's great, get an application, fill it all out and email it to the landlord. 

i get a call from him a few hours later, just going over details of my application and he offers me the apt. i'm going to go in on monday to sign the lease. 

okay so now it's saturday night and i'm just swiping through tinder and match with a cute guy, mid 30s, (im 20). let's call him steve
he messaged me, we flirt, he comes over to my place. we have mediocre sex at best, then he leaves to go home. 

so monday rolls around and i go to the apartment building to sign the lease and tie up any loose ends

i walk up the building and steve is standing outside with a woman and i see he has some papers in his hand. 

the woman waves to me and introduces herself as steve's wife. steve looks totally chill, while i'm freaking outside but trying to remain calm. i did not sign up for this. 

anyway, i feel bad for his wife and i feel like a horrible person even though i had no idea that he was married. 
can't wait to live there for a whole year!

"by unknowingly doping for the entire school year. this has been in the making since last september. this is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.

late last summer i started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. i'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.

though i've always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call i needed to start working out. beside hitting the gym, i also joined a sharpshooting club, and was i was natural at it. over the course of a few months i moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. my aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.

i'm pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but i sure as hell didn't. in the meantime a cardiologist said ""tough shit"" and bumped up the meds.

during the course of this school year i was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. the stakes were high, but i was a stone cold shooter. later that day checking out my fitbit, i found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when i had to bicycle over the the range.

flash forward 2 more tournaments to today. my friend jokingly mentioned that i must've been doping to do so well and the dots connected. i googled ""metoprolol doping"", there it was. i still haven't told anyone, but reddit. what the hell do i do now?

tl:dr started taking beta blockers for heart problems, joined a sharpshooting club and won 3 tournaments by unknowingly using a common doping drug.",4
"twice by grabbing a new coworkers boob and then forgetting her husband died.    happened an hour ago on lunch, so a real tifu for you guys. on wednesday's our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it's a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. it is normal to carpool all together and naturally i drive my two friend-coworkers each time. however this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we'll call her sarah (changed). she's quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. while everyone is leaving the office for lunch i offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. now here's where the first fuck up happens.
   while on the way to the restaurant sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. traffic comes to a halt and i slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. i check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing i am currently full on honkin sarah's right knocker my words start to trail off. ""damn i hope everyone is oka....."" that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that i was just reacting to the situation. for the next few minutes the car was silent until sarah said ""that's funny i haven't had that much action in a while"" which eased the mood and the car all laughed. and fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying ""ahh well we all have our dry spells."" something i thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. she goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. 
   we get to lunch and everything seems okay but sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so i ask what's up. she told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. i instantly apologized saying i had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that i was sorry. she said she didn't care about that and that it was fine it's just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. my heart sunk. i had completely forgotten about her husband. i felt so bad i instantly started apologizing for everything in the world i felt horrible. my friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. i feel so horrible that i have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. please reddit help me feel a little better.

"nsfw by posting a video of me masturbating to my work group chat. 

okay so this literally just happened. im dying slowly from the embarrassment, and cant believe it happened to me. 

on snapchat we have a work group chat that i post on pretty frequently. well tonight my so asked me to send her a video of me masturbating cause she gets off on that and we haven't been able to see each other in a couple days do to our schedules. i always check to see if i added any other names to what i send by accident but i recently  just upgraded phones from my note 5 to galaxy 8+ which doesn't have a home button. so apparently as i went to press send i have the horrible habit of sliding my thumb across the screen since im used to having an actual area there. 

i realized my misfortune the moment i pressed sent. since im also a frequent poster everyone opened it immediately and i just want to die. it wasnt just a regular video either, it was like a volcano erupted if you know what i mean...i just want to hide. its about to be very awkward at work tomorrow 


tl;dr dont slide your fingers across the screen when pressing send  because i accidently sent a video of a volcanic eruption of me playing pocket pool to my work group chat


update: so im not getting fired luckily. im at work right now but the jokes have definitely started. ive heard so many michael jackson just beat it references its unreal. the group chat is mostly comprised of people i go to college with. even the manager is a college student, but the embarrassment is still the same. my boss just laughed it off and told me just because im cool with everyone, i probably shouldn't post my dick in the groupchat.  also holy fuck this blew up! thank you for the gold, the fake internet karma and fame is helping me cope a little bit at least.

"by being on this subreddit too much and hurting my boyfriend's feelings. anyone remember the of the guy that suck his own dick in front of his assistant at a bachelorette party? he included a drawing of how he did that.

so my boyfriend was doing some stretches on bed, and one of the stretches is the same pose as what that guy drew.

i commented about it and said ""hey that's how the guy sucked his own dick."" 

my boyfriend being silly then try to see if he can reach his too and i gave him a little push.
obviously he isn't as flexible (just like how most people are not) and i said;

""well it's okay, he did mention afterall that he also have a big dick""

and in that moment i felt as if time slowed down and i can see his face going into this super disappointed look.

and that is how i fucked up by hurting his feelings.


tl;dr: i told my boyfriend he have a small dick indirectly and unintentionally and hurt his feelings

edit: y'all need to chill. i never did mention that his dick is actually small (and to clarify, hell no it isn't).
to give more context, it all happened in a light hearted and silly mood. sure his feelings probably got hurt for a while (can't deny that horrified look i saw) but obviously i reassured him and we laughed about it. 

reason i posted this is because my boyfriend is the one that casually mentioned about posting here, and i am curious what kind of reaction it'll get

we are now both laughing at how worked up some of you actually got ;)

"by giving my wife a facial in front of my step-daughter. still processing this one since it took place about five hours ago. me (45m) and my wife (47f) have been married for about 5 years and have a combined family. most of our kids are half time with us and half time with their other parents. anyway, my 20yo step-daughter's room is just down the hall from the master bedroom. about 6 weeks ago, she started sleep walking and wakes standing in random places, she even woke up in the kennel with our dog once (yes i know it's super strange).

because my wife and i are trying not to scar the kids, we wait until they are all asleep before we have sexy times. many times this means we go to sleep and then wake each other up in the middle of the night for sexy time. last night was one of those nights. when we went to bed (between 8 and 9 because we get up at 4am to workout) kids were still up and milling around, so we figured we'd wait until the middle of the night or have a quicky before we went to the gym.

a few hours later i wake to a stiffy pressed up against my wife's backside and decide it's game time. within a couple of minutes we are deeply into it and a few minutes later we know it's about time for the grand finale. my wife breathlessly tells me the words that every man around the planet loves to hear ""i want to finish you with my mouth"". i practically jumped off the bed and stand there as my wife gets on her knees to give me a toe curling bj.

i am going to interrupt this story for a moment to give another little factoid. my wife was a single mom to four girls for many years prior to meeting and then marrying me. her and her daughters are pretty immodest around the house. i'm constantly asking them to put shorts or sweats on.

anyway, there i am standing naked beside my bed. my wife is on her knees sucking my soul out through my dick. my eyes are closed my head is back and i'm just about to release when i get that weird feeling that i'm being watched. i open my eyes and see my 20yo step daughter standing three feet behind her mom in a tank top and panties. i reflexively pulled back from my wife's mouth which caused her to grab extra hard the next thing i know i'm spraying my load all over her face while i'm looking directly into my step-daughter's eyes. my wife is trying to be playful and thinks i'm just feeling kinky and i was just trying to cover myself. my step-daughter just stands there for what seemed like an eternity before saying ""holy shit"" over and over and walking out of our room and back to hers. of course as soon as my wife heard her daughter's voice she became much less playful and everything got deadly serious.

so now i've gone to the gym, am sitting at my desk working and my wife has been in talking with her daughter for the past couple of hours. honestly my only fuckup was the timing. but it did happen today, so there is that.

tl;dr my wife and i had middle of the night sexy time, sleep walking step-daughter walked into the room and watched me frost my wife like a cake.

follow up: they are done talking came out of the room laughing and stuff so i guess no harm no foul. my wife said the three of us should sit down later and talk about the what happened and that her daughter has some questions.

edit: to all those wondering why i added the part about how my step-daughters dress. at the time i was worried that my wife was going to be thinking i was a freak for nutting as soon as i saw her daughter in her panties. that didn't happen at all, when i mentioned it to my wife she waved it off. if i were to write this post now i would leave it out, but it was important to my mindset at the time.

edit: people are claiming that it's been deleted, but i still see it and haven't tried to delete it. any how, i just tagged it as nsfw (something i should have done in the beginning, but i didn't know) maybe that fixes things. i'm enjoying some of you funny sick people.

edit: well we just had an hour plus conversation. my step-daughter was just wanting to clear the air (she was a lot more mature about it than i thought she would be). she asked a couple of questions about how often is normal and stuff like that. i don't want to get too specific, but all of her questions centered around how far my wife and i pushed each other's boundaries sexually. we were open and honest with her about it. turns out she is not a virgin (i am actually surprised) and the first guy she was with was very pushy. the guy she's with now is very laid back, but maybe too laid back. we told her to be vocal with him about what she wants. i think she understands, but my wife is going to follow up on the conversation later.

btw, she did not even realize what was going on at first. all she saw was that i was standing there naked. it was when i saw her and started to freak out that she understood what was going on.. my wife and i have already stripped the bed and are washing the sheets and comforter. i am shampooing the carpet this afternoon and there are spots on the wall that need to be washed. my wife found some of my material in her hair... at work she sent me this pic(http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xlxbjv-kw_8/ui2kgl4_o_i/aaaaaaaag8u/ymwe-6bxi8i/s1600/cameron-diaz-there's-something-about-mary-ejaculate-hair-gel.jpeg).

i got back on here and this post is at almost 10k and my inbox is screaming for mercy. i'll try to answer as many questions as possible.

ok, i'm disabling inbox replies. i can't believe that my (by far) most upvoted post is about my wife and i nearly emotionally scaring my step-daughter. be well everybody.",4
"by instead of sucking the dick, the dick suck me. today my cousin bought an 8 inch black realistic suction cup dildo as a birthday present for my brother, whom in horror discarded the obscene dingus. being the saint that i am, i adopted this orphaned device. 

my friend and i provided the poor discarded ornament with a purpose, i replaced the toilet roll holder with our new trinket, which worked fabulously. 

however, the mere potential of comical joy to be experienced was wasted on such a mundane destiny, and thus i proceeded to stick the suction end to my forehead and become the unicorn i was meant to be... i had reached my comical peak. as we cackled at the flailing 8 inch dick upon my forehead i could feel something was terribly wrong. 

i heard a loud squelching pop as the large appendage detached, my friend looked at me in horror. upon my forehead i had been crested with the biggest hickey possibly to have existed in the past millennia. the curse spot consists of a large darkening purple oval of approximately 6cm by 3cm. 

i leave for italy in 8 hours for my summer holiday.... my friends won't be able to look at me in the eyes. i fear for what the security at the airport may think of my battle wound.

"tifu by not understanding that 3.5 grams can be a fuckload. this actually did happen within the last 24 hours, i'm still lying in bed trying to recover. 

so, weed has been legalized, yay canada! obviously, the first weekend after legalization, getting fucked up is in order. my girlfriend and i had a free weekend (kids weren't here), and that won't happen again for a while, which adds further justification. but we live in an apartment building, we don't want to stink everything up, so we decided to do edibles.

i figured, hey, let's keep it conservative, never done this before, don't want to put too much in there, right? i mean, not that weed can ever be that bad, haha, it's just marijuana. fucking harmless. so i spend the morning and afternoon decarbing 3.5 grams of mk ultra and infusing it into half a cup of butter, which was then used to make brownies. which were quite good.

we cut this shit into about 15 equal pieces. now, i am still at this moment struggling with the math, which is pathetic given that we spent two hours trying to figure it out last night. but, i'm pretty sure that works out to 232 mg per brownie. *apparently* you should start with 10 mg. see how that goes. but on friday night, we vaped through about 2 full grams and i didn't feel a damn thing.

we started with two brownies each. two hours later, my girlfriend was fucked up. i was fine. so i had another one. an hour later, she could barely walk. i didn't feel it as bad as her. so, i had one more. that's 6/15, not even half the batch between us.

turns out mj is a helluva drug. jesus mother-fucking christ. we spent about 6 hours completely fucked up. oh my lawd, i had no fucking clue that that level of impairment was possible from weed. my mind is blown. i could not talk properly; sipping from a cup was this ""big deal"" where my girlfriend and i had to talk me through and encourage me; rolling over was this totally confusing repeated realization that there's a *whole other half of this room to look at*, wow!

we were wrecked. about halfway through, it went from being a laughfest to being a grim holding on. we just held hands and encouraged each other not to panic. my girlfriend thought she was dying, she was reciting her last will and testament to herself. she wanted to call an ambulance. none of this is hyperbole. we're both exhausted and sore from the twitching. the dry mouth might've been the worst part. it was incredibly intense, we had trouble talking because our mouths were so dry. 

we threw the rest of the brownies out. the smell of weed is going to make me nauseous for weeks probably.

tldr: 125lb woman ingests half a gram of weed in brownies, 205lb man ingests almost a full gram. both are amazed to discover that weed can in fact profoundly fuck them up. it waaaaaay too much.

edit: thanks for the gold! and silver! and platinum! kinda worth it...?

edit 2: yes, it is a tragedy about throwing the brownies out. i honestly, sincerely hate the waste. but we couldn't even look at them this morning without our stomachs flip-flopping, and we absolutely could not risk the kids getting them. that would be unforgivably irresponsible. 

edit 3: i *did* do research, i just didn't do enough. we have now learned correct math from the comments. you're **supposed** to dose edibles using the thc percentage. this stuff has been tested at 18%. so, using that estimate, with 233 mg of weed per brownie, she had 84 mg and i had 168... holy fuck.

edit 4: i used the double boil mason jar method for about 60 min to decarb, then dropped a 1/2 cup of butter into the jar and let it boil for another 80 minutes. every 10 minutes i topped up the water and shook the mixture around in the jar. there wasn't much smell at all. i can confidently state that this method works well enough to get a person high.

**final edit**: some important safety tips from someone who read the safety tips and didn't get it, and is now learning from hundreds of comments. for those making **positive** contributions, thank you! we're enjoying them! 
1. they say wait at least 2 hours before having another. *wait longer*! like, a day. it is not worth the risk of having too much.
2. there's a general agreement that edibles are much stronger, and that even someone with a respectable tolerance for smoking might get annihilated.
3. there's a lot of stories here where the impairment lasted days. i fucked up even bigger by not fully considering that. so keep that in mind. ",4
"by accidentally dosing myself with lsd at work.. throwaway.  well it was around noon when i ate my pasta.  shortly after that i found myself to be slightly off-kilter and queasy but in great spirits.  i initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee i shouldn't have had.  at 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which i always use for some gym time.  as i was walking out of the office i realized that this wasn't just the caffeine talking.  the possibility that i was in fact, tripping, didn't even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  somehow.  life finds a way.  saturday morning i had prepared some 'gummy bears' for my friends using the translucent tupperware lid as the backdrop. some of the residue must have lived through the night.  on sunday i made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the tupperware.  i put the lid on and didn't think twice about it.  today i ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  or maybe i laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  i'm honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since i microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it's my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. it did though and by the time i had walked to the gym i knew damn well what was coming my way.   well anyway, i went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  the work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, i started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when i didn't know where i was going, or why.  i pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before i had to take the plunge.  i did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  i cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. my behavior was normal except for when i forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  we had a new team-member start today and i had to give her a tour.   i don't think she could tell i was fucked up but i know i was sweating a lot and rambling.  i now have another 50 minutes before i very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  what a fucking monday.

tl;dr: accidentally dosed myself and had to spend the rest of the day pretending i was a normal, sober, middle-level manager at the office.",4
"by falling asleep wearing vr headset, breaking my monitor, and making my parents think i'm dying.. this happened about 30 minutes ago, it's 4am and i'm tired and stupid for this. 

i'm one of those people, where if i fall asleep i sometimes forget what i was doing before i went to sleep.

so i was playing re7 in vr, but it was getting kinda late but i wanted to stay up and play anyways. i started to fall asleep, and just passed out kinda instantly.

then i woke up, my head felling weirdly heavy. but holy shit i just woke up and all i can see around me is a dark room with some tables chairs all i can hear are creepy noises and its dark outside and  i have no idea where i am. 

so logically i stand up from my chair( i didn't even check to look, but i'm pretty sure my in game guy was standing) and run and scream.

somehow my arm got around my monitor( or maybe a cord idk), i also ran into the wall (which made no sense to me because i wasn't even near a wall), and then it happened.

i start to feel hands all around me(my mom), and the feeling of something come in or out of my ear(my earbuds that i didn't know were there), and the sound of my mom asking ""what the hell, are you ok?""

she took the headset off of me, and i see the destruction i did to my monitor, and the small dent/damage to the wall. 

my mom laughed her ass off at me, and told me we will talk about it tomorrow.

"by letting my niece and nephew use my psn account, and ruining my girlfriend's holiday.. update post here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu\_update\_letting\_my\_nephew\_use\_my\_fortnite/(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu_update_letting_my_nephew_use_my_fortnite/)   


maybe you already know where this is going.

my niece and nephew are the best niece and nephew an uncle could ask for. they're bright,  kind, good-natured kids. my niece (who we'll call l), and my nephew (who we'll call w) don't have many games on their psn account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle i am, i game them access to my psn account, to play my far superior collection of games.all was well for about a month. i knew they couldn't buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.

but imagine my surprise yesterday when i get this message on facebook...

&#x200b;

""a\_sad\_frog, can you check your bank? ""

it was my brother in law. l and w's father.

""w is playing fortnite and he has 65,000 v bucks, is this normal?""

&#x200b;

my heart stopped. their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.i went to my transaction history on psn, and nearly threw up when i saw this(https://imgur.com/a/qzu4scn)**(identifying details have been cropped out):**

&#x200b;

all told, £422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. by the time i got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 vbucks had already been spent. i saw that the playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn't require a code. that's **fu number 1.**""tell them to stop what they're doing. shut off your ps4. i have to sort this out"".

&#x200b;

i immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **nothing**. playstation store doesn't have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. this is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherf\*ng v bucks or some other bullsh\*t currency. for all intents and purposes, i have lost that money. the bank can't do anything about it.

so here's where it gets really messed up. **fu number 2**. my girlfriend is visiting family in the us, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. she will have expenses sorted because she's staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can't take part in now. that was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than i ever could have expected, and far better than i deserved.

i'm not mad at the kids. i genuinely don't think they meant it. i'm mad at myself. i didn't think it was possible, but then i should have done more research. i feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just f'ed. we're not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.

so, fair warning, **double check that your payment security features on psn are set up properly** or you could end up getting thoroughly shafted as we did.

**tldr:** left my playstation account to the mercy of my 5 year old nephew, who spent all of my girlfriend's holiday money on vbucks, mostly in the space of a day.

**edit:** a couple of people have mentioned that we get email notifications on a purchase. this is true, but it's set up on a different email that wasn't set up on our phones to notify us. it would have **dramatically** improved the outcome of this if we had done that. **fu number 3** confirmed.

**update #1:** playstation support was closed for phonecalls today, so it will be tomorrow (monday) when i can contact them.",4
"by fingering a girl. obligatory this happened yesterday. this girl and i had a fun filled day out on the town. afterwards we got a hotel. things started getting hot and heavy and my fingers ended up in her pants. one thing led to another and i started fingering her. she was having a grand old time showing the usual signs that i was doing a decent job. a good portion of the way through my nails must have given her a bit of a cut and she said ou.... and passed out cold. i'm sitting her wondering what the fuck just happened. i call her name and start panicingly shaking her. she's not responsive and i slap her face. as soon as i did this she starts having a seizure. now i'm freaking the out. i jump out of bed and start to call an ambulance. i'm about to start the call and when she stops and starts making grunting noises. she's giving me this wtf just happened look and i tell her what happened. at first she tells me she doesn't believe me but then said that she has a history of having seizures when she gets hurt or scared. she said that when she has a seizure it's best to let it take its course unless it goes on for a while. i just sat there in that ""thank god i didn't finger a girl to death"" state. needless to say our sexy time ended right there.

tldr: i fingered a girl into a seizure. she stops and says it happens sometimes.",4
"by revealing that i had secretly hid in my roomate's closet during his pre-bedtime ritual. obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.

i lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we'll call them ned and ethan. the three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. the most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out adam sandler's at a medium pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (everyone thinks they're hilarious in college, i know).
the most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. but one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in ned's bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of adam sandler on my shitty washburn 6-string. 

trying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but ned was no random college student. ned was the 6'3"" milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. in short, ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. so to me, that meant that whenever ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.

so i grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he'd think i had went to bed early), and snuck into ned's bedroom to position myself in his closet. it was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, like this(https://cdn.instructables.com/fya/uc2h/hmvja37y/fyauc2hhmvja37y.medium.jpg). ned's bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so i'd have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and ned, in case i accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. but directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was ned's computer and desk. 
ned came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, i could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. the 12 inch proximity of ned spiked my adrenaline, and i began to control my breathing. my back was pressed against coat hangers, and i had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and i had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. (artist depiction(https://i.imgur.com/xmlm5bh.png))

as ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. ned did not reach for his glass of water. ned did not opt for the pajamas. ned did not leave his desk. ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.

a million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. if i make myself known now, he'd be immensely embarrassed and angry that i had just violated his privacy. but if i *didn't* speak up now, chances are i'd have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. so i was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. it felt like i was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.

my hands began to cramp as i awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn't generate an ounce of noise. my legs began to jitter as i compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as i waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell i was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.

after ned's satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that i had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.

ned promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and i had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. all critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until i remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. but with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would i get the phone out my pocket? somehow i did, and i texted ethan in the next room over:

> foogama: in ned's closet. was trying to do medium pace gag. ned started wanking before i could start. now i'm stuck in the closet and can't get out. need help.
> 
> ethan: lol right.
> 
> foogama: ethan, i'm dead serious. i need you to help create a distraction for ned so that i can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.
> 
> ethan: …we're going to need to have a talk later.

right around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). it was 10:45pm on a thursday, but i could hear ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **""hello? why yes ned is here. is everything okay? ned! ned come here, phone for you!""** ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. how this never raised suspicion, i'll never know. it was a cordless phone. there was no need for ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. but thank god he did. i bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some ""stranger"" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.

i was forever in debt to ethan for saving my ass, and we never told ned. that is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in ned's wedding. there was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we ""found interesting"" about ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, i was convinced by ethan to write ""that he enjoys anal sex with large black women"" because it would make a fun ""bachelor story"" over 10 years after the fact.

but of course that's not what happened. the best man decided it would be more fun to—without warning—switch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we'd be reading the bride's, and they'd be reading ned's. and of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. i didn't even know her name. i had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.

the bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. he immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. i immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. ethan and i waited for ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. we were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.

**tl;dr – hid in my roommate's closet as a prank, watched him jack off to anal porn 12 inches away, kept it a secret for over a decade, and then revealed the information to his bride's best friends in the most awkward way possible on his wedding day.**

i've since learned my lesson and just don't hide in peoples' bedrooms like an idiot.

edit: thank you all for the gold, comments, and concerns for ned. ned is a really great guy and i'm sure we'll be fine.

edit 2: i got ""ethan"" to create a reddit account and entertain questions. you can find his comment here(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7y6bqu/tifu_by_revealing_that_i_had_secretly_hid_in_my/duf2fq4/).

"by losing my right testicle in a ball slapping contest. obligatory ""didn't happen today"" but four years ago when i was 17.

also no need for a throwaway account since pretty much everyone i know have heard the story.

&#x200b;

my friend and i were in the sauna and he gets an idea that we should see which one of us could make our balls clap louder by hip thrusting back and forth and i was like ""yeah haha let's do that!"" so there we were, two straight dudes standing in the sauna hip thrusting away and laughing at the sound our sacks made. my friend won the contest and we sat down. i started to feel a little uncomfortable. like someone was squeezing my right nut. it didn't hurt that much when i was sitting down but once i got out of the sauna and went to take a shower the pain level spiked suddenly. my vision went blurry and ears started ringing from the pain (and possibly dehydration from furiously hip thrusting in an 80 ° c sauna). i dragged myself to the kitchen and sat down. my friend brought me a glass of water and i chugged it down in one go. i told him that my testicle hurts like never before and asked if he had any painkillers. he asked me if i preferred paracetamol or ibuprofen, i said i'll have both. i chewed the pills and swallowed them without water or anything, usually i require generous amounts of water but this time it was an emergency. i laid down on his bed for a while and when the pain was at a tolerable level i told him that i'm going to head home. i had ridden my moped there so i had to ride it home as well. it was winter and the roads were bumpy. each bump felt like someone punched me in the ball sack but i managed to get home. once i got home i walked  straight to my room and wet to sleep. usually i stay up late so my mom came to see me and asked why i went to sleep so early. she was worried that i had been drinking or taken drugs so i just told her that i almost fainted and want to sleep now. in the morning when i woke up the pain had eased but my testicle was oddly shaped and still a bit sore so i rode my moped to school and went to the school nurse straight away. she examined my ball and wrote me a referral to a hospital. when i got home from school i showed the referral to my dad and he drove me to the hospital. there they took a urine sample and an ultrasound. we waited for the results and an hour later a surgeon comes almost running to me and told me that i had a testicular torsion and that we would be going to the operating room immediately. a nurse handed me hospital clothes and my dad took all my personal belongings. i changed my clothes and lied down on the hospital bed and they rushed me through the hospital to the operating room. i was put to sleep and when i woke up in the recovery ward i immediately sat up. a nurse noticed me and told me about the surgery. they tried to restore the blood flow to my testicle but it had already gone necrotic and it had to be removed. i started laughing hysterically (probably due to the medication and anesthetics). the nurse informed my parents and they came to visit me an hour later. they were shocked about my condition and asked me how i was feeling ""as a man"" but i told them that i just find it funny how one one can lose a testicle in a ball slapping contest.

"by ruining a vegetarian's love of gummy candy. i like to have some gummy bears at my desk in the morning. because every day is a good day when you start it with gummy bears. i always offer some to anyone who happens to pass through my office. one person in our office is a vegetarian, i am aware of this. they passed by as another person and i were enjoying gummy bears, i quickly began to offer them one and then halfway through my offer i was like ""oh sorry, right! you won't want these!"" 

they responded with ""why wouldn't i?! i love gummy bears!"" i stared awkwardly for a moment before responding with ""well, they have beef gelatin in them."" 

them: ""what do you mean beef gelatin? why would they use that instead of regular gelatin?""

me: ""i thought all gelatin came from animals.""

them: ""are you serious? you aren't serious right? i love gummy bears. my kid and i eat them together all the time."" (kid is vegetarian as well)

me (now panicking): ""i think i am. i don't know. maybe you're right! i'm 
sorry! you're welcome to have some, but the label definitely specifies beef gelatin.""

they now eye my gummy bears with a strange expression of disbelief, longing, anger, and disgust. i swear i could see them going through the stages of grief because i know how sad i would be if gummy bears were ruined for me. so by shattering a vegetarian's blissfully ignorant love of gummy bears.

edit2: formatting (thank you to the user who showed me the way. hopefully it's a bit better now). also, thank you for the awards!! but! it they are costing you money, please donate said money to a charity near you that feeds hungry people. or buy a vegetarian friend a bag of vegetarian friendly gummy bears!",4
"by hoarding my grandparents' pension and starving them.. my grandparents don't earn much and are living hand to mouth. they don't go out much from their house. so i help them in their routine chores like paying bills, going to atms etc.  i'm also incharge of collecting their pension. 

few days back, my granddad gave me the undertaking required to collect the pension. it usually takes an hour but that day it took 3. i also had somethings to attend to. so, when i was done, i realised that it was late. i came back to my place (we live separately) and figured that i'll return his pension the next day. 

the next few days were so hectic that i completely forgot about his pension. i usually keep two wallets, one has all the cash (which i keep at home and has the pension) and the other one has only cards. i use the latter one more. after 5 days, i was in need of some cash. so i opened my other wallet and realized that his pension was still sitting there. 

i was horrified and then some guilt came and then a little more. i was so ashamed that i ran to their house. i knew that they'd be angry so i bought some groceries as a compensation. as soon as my granddad opened the door,  i started apologizing. he kept smiling during my apology and forgave me as soon as i was done. i handed over the pension and went to keep the groceries in the fridge.

well my guilt was gone and i was again my normal miserable self. i opened the fridge to put the groceries in, and it was literally empty except a few ice trays there was nothing. my guilt came running back to me, i walked in the kitchen and there was just a half cut loaf of bread. i knew i was the cause of this. 

i asked them about it and they told me how they knew i was busy and thought that i'd turn up when i have the time. they didn't even try calling me because of the same reason. i had never been more ashamed in my life.  my one mistake pushed them towards starvation. 

they already had a really hard life. they had been abandoned by their children, who took all their money. first their children stopped caring then somewhere down the line, they did too. and i guess that's why they've stopped asking for anything from anyone. it's really hard to watch and still, they keep smiling with their saddened eyes. i guess when you get old, you stop expecting from life anymore. 

tl;dr: forgot to give my grandpa's pension back due to my busy schedule. they didn't have enough money to buy groceries and had to survive on a loaf of bread.

edit4: guys i'd like to give you some context. there are so many valuable suggestions but i'd like to mention that i live in india. there are not many services available related to elderly. even the normal food delivery services are scarce.
also i've tried many things but my grandparents are very unlucky. they were doing well until 4 years ago, when my grandpa lost his eyesight due to his diabetes and cataract. he now can only see from one eye having only 1/8th vision and is advised to not to read or write. he used to handle all the finances but now he is unable to do anything.
my grandma is not literate. she dropped out of school in early years and couldn't read or write much. so she can't access any services. she just does the household chores. 
that's why i've been helping them.

she has no idea i know any of this information, and i'm too into her to say anything. please help! what do i do?
tl;dr girlfriend i'm basically in love with has a tumblr talking about her recent tinder dates and undying love for her ex and she doesn't know i know",4
"by not closing the tab of porn on my phone after masturbating.. here we go. this happened yesterday in university. 

so, i wake up at 7 and i have two mid-term internal class tests from 8:30 to 9:30 and another from 9:30 to 10:30.

i brush my teeth and take a bath and go to my room to get dressed. as i am drying myself i pick up the phone to check time and it's only 7:20 yet and i have good 30 minutes as breakfast plus travel only takes 40 minutes from my home to university and i haven't had a good release since a week. 

i take my phone, sit on my bed, scratch my balls while searching pornhub. i take my time and find some videos and start doing my own rhythm. i am all into it and realise i have only 5 more minutes left. i give myself the dopamine and get dressed in a hurry. 

i reach university and the examination hall is already full. here (india) you can only take your stationary, water bottle, calculator (scientific not programmable) and your exam registration. i take my stuff and enter the classroom. 

the invigilator signs me in and hands me the answer sheet and question paper. i go to my desk and as i am fumbling around for my pen, my hand senses the phone in my left pocket. i lose my shit and get all tensed up. 

i try to keep calm and switch it to silent mode and tell myself if i act normally i won't get caught with it and will probably not get into any trouble. 

soon after the unfair means squad (they check if you have something to cheat) enter the class and go around checking for books or questionable stuff. i keep my head down and act like i have nothing. 

one of the female professors lands next to me and tells me to get up. i start sweating and i almost shit my pants. she tells me to empty my pockets and i take everything out and put it on the desk.

 she stares at me and picks up my phone. 

""you seem like a studious one. why are you cheating?"" she said. 

""i am not. it's an honest mistake."" 

then she asks me to unlock it so that she can check if i have any pdf or browser open and says that if she finds nothing, she'll let me go. 

my heart finally stops powering a jet and i place my finger over the fingerprint and it opens. 

my heart now starts powering a rocket as i recognise the black screen with a buffer between it. the video paused.  there's nothing on the screen though. no image or thumbnail. 

""cheating from a video?"" she says and she clicks play button on the bottom left. 

there it is. dani daniels and manuel ferrara going at it. the sound of dani daniels screaming like a cat being strangled echoes through out the hall. 

the professor dropped my phone and had a face as if i was masturbating in front of her. 

now i have failed computational mathematics and have to give a written apology to the dean of academics and convenor of examination. 

anyway, one girl who was sitting somewhere around me asked which porn was it. had to send the link. 


tl;dr : i forgot to close my porn window after masturbating. accidentally took my phone to the examination hall where it wasn't allowed and thr professor caught me. she checked the phone and the porn plays at full volume in the hall with 70 people sitting in it.

edit : 

1. for the people who think this is fake. it is not.   
                                                         
2.  for people who are saying why was i failed and now need to produce an apology one even though i wasn't cheating - it is because in india these things are taken very seriously and even small stupid things are grounds for detention and lawful action. also, i only need to apologise for the phone and not for the porn. 

3. the porn was manuel ferrara and dani daniels, they don't have much together. you will easily get it with one search on pornhub. if i may suggest something much more better, please try manuel ferrara and the goddess remy lacroix. the video starts with them talking about cup or something. that also is easily available. 

4. about the girl who asked for the link. 

i was standing outside the hall for the invigilator to take me to the office of the convenor of examination for further process and boy was she taking her time. 

the girl must have finished her paper soon and left the hall. as she came outside she asked me why did i bring a phone to the exam and even if i did, i could have just reported it and handed it over to the invigilator and collected it after the exam. i said i could have but my i couldn't think at that time and was afraid. 

after that the invigilator told me to report to the office without her. the girl accompanied me to the admin office. i accepted my fault, signed the confiscation receipt and collected my phone. 

it was switched off so turned it on and she just casually was a peeking at it from the side. she asked to show me what was the video while giggling and i thought what the heck and showed it to her for a split second and then closed it. she started laughing and told me i am weird and then casually asked to send her the link. then while we walked to the cafeteria, she told me she was my senior and was the co-mentor for my yearly project the previous year. she remembered my name and my department. then we parted ways. 

for fuck's sake, she is cute. stop telling me to pursue her. i have another exam later. maybe will meet her there. 


the indian people here obviously understand why such strict action was taken against me.

edit 2: man i have been reading the comments and you bastards are funny as fuck. i have bee quite depressed since a few weeks and this cheered me up good. 

thanks for whoever sent the silver and gold. i haven't figured out what to do with them anyway.

edit 3: invigilator is an actual word people and we use it all the time. in fact, that is the word for exam proctor here in india borrowed down from the time when we had a case of britishers. 

thanks for the gold and silver again. open some sort of privileged sub-reddits i think.",4
"by accepting a proposition for a threesome. obligatory this didn't happen today, it happened last summer. newly obligatory this will not end in incest. i didn't accidentally eat out my cousin or half-sister or whatever dumbass erotica you're all posting lately. obligatory tl;dr at bottom.

&#x200b;

it's a perfect summer night in 2018. i'm leaving a job that i hate with my life, freshly broken up with, ready to throw on my leather and fuck anyone in arm's reach. i turn up to my local watering hole right before 1 am,  toss back a couple beers and post up, alone, on the outskirts of the main bar.

&#x200b;

last call rings out, the bar is mobbed. i lock eyes with a moderately attractive girl (mag) who approaches me shortly after. she's equal parts drunk/horny, and does not hesitate to let me know. she's celebrating a friend's birthday with a squad of girls, one of whom sidles up to us and starts hitting on me hard.

&#x200b;

mag is totally fine with this, and the friend would land on the higher end of the bmi chart, leading me to believe i'm being hit with a bait and switch. they swiftly disprove that theory by literally asking if i ""want both"" of them. worth noting that this is the only time i've been anywhere near a threesome, before or since, so i jumped at the chance.

&#x200b;

next thing i know, we're in a cab on the way back to whoever's house the birthday pregame was. there is alcohol everywhere. they're feeding me shots/cold buffalo chicken dip like it's my last day on earth. some girl is crying on the couch.

&#x200b;

my drunk ass picks up the signal that an ex-boyfriend is the cause of this girl's sorrow. having been recently broken up with, i know exactly where her head is at. having done far too many shots, i am not scared to console this crying stranger. soon i will be the advice champion, and fuck every girl in the house.

&#x200b;

i launch into my speech, hitting every point she so desperately needs to hear:

* you're so much better than him.
* he *obviously* doesn't deserve you.
* you'll look back and laugh at this in a month.

&#x200b;

i'm now starting to notice that the cheers and applause i was waiting for are actually all death stares, even a few dropped jaws. as it turns out, this girl's boyfriend didn't break up with her. 

&#x200b;

no, he fucking ***died.***

&#x200b;

the guy died in a car accident and i'm telling her she'll be laughing about it in a month. nobody fucked anybody that night.

&#x200b;

**tl;dr:** i was invited back to a girl's house for a threesome, got very drunk and tried to console a girl crying over her ex-boyfriend that she's better than him, etc. he didn't break up with her, he fucking died.",4
"while talking dirty to my gf. throwaway for obvious reasons.

so a little background: my current gf and i have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. before her i was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and i'm learning everything for the first time. long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. i said i was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside i knew that i had no idea what i would be doing and would kind of be winging it. last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. so we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. she's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.
she kind of rambled for a bit, and i was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. the rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than i normally do. this is all new territory for me, but i'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like christopher columbus, and she's what i think is india. so i decide to talk dirty. her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, i figure this is the perfect time to strike. and that's when i cleverly decided to ask if i make her ""moister than an oyster"". 

her face fell. it's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. i went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. i've been wondering how i could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. we approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. i don't think i'll be redeeming myself anytime soon. 

tldr: i decided to be sexy and asked my gf if i made her moister than an oyster. she doesn't think oysters are sexy.",4
"by making fun of anti-vaxers at my new job in front of my pregnant and (apparently) anti-vaxer manager.. so i just started in this company a few weeks back. i'm your typical shy person that in the first few weeks doesn't say much and really needs some time to get comfortable with the new situation and new people. starting this job it was no different.

now, a few weeks later i'm starting to feel comfortable around everyone and also starting to make jokes and joining non-work related discussions between co-workers. somehow we landed on the topic of old diseases that nowadays barely occur. my manager named a few and i said that the ones she mentioned actually still exist in other less developed parts of the world.

then i jokingly said, 'and nowadays you don't know, with the rise of brain dead anti-vaxx moms we might be again introduced to all kinds of weird and ancient diseases.' ...

my co-workers all cracked a laugh, but the look on my managers face said it all and there was instant regret from my side. she raised her voice and started firing questions asking  anti-vaxx moms are brain dead, rambling about the vaccines being the cause of autism and the pharma industry is trying to control the mind and body of her coming baby. it was one blasting tirade, about how she is woke and shit.

i guess the coming year will be one really interesting one for me.

**tl:dr** joked about anti-vaxx moms in front of my manager who is pregnant, and apparently supports the anti-vaxx movement. tension on the workplace ever since have been, so to call, quite high. ",4
"by letting my parents have access to my bank account and student loan money.. backstory- my parents wanted me to learn responsibility with money when i was in middle school so they opened a bank account for me with a debit card. they have complete access to it and can take out or add money if they want to. multiple times while in high school i had money saved up in my account and they took huge chunks out because they ""needed it."" i was paid back in increments when they took large amounts of money out but i still don't think they have fully paid me back for all the money they took. 

fast forward to now and i still haven't learned my lesson of keeping my money in a separate account that they don't have access to. i have to take our student loans to pay for school (tuition, rent, utilities, food, etc). i had $4000 in student loan money in my account last month and i get a text from my mom saying she transferred all that money to her account so she could pay my rent in advance for the next couple months. i didn't understand why she did that because i've been paying my monthly rent just fine but i said okay and didn't think twice about it until yesterday. 

my rent is due the first of each month and if my mom would have prepaid my rent, i should not have gotten a notification to pay it. but i did get a notification and i was confused. i logged online to look at my account and it said i needed to make a payment. i thought it was just an error or something so i called the 24 hour hotline and they told me there was no payment ever made. i confronted my mom about this and she said ""oh crap i forgot to pay it! let me go pay it real quick."" i was relieved but only for a little bit. she came back later and told me my dad spent all my loan money on bills and christmas gifts because he thought it was theirs. she told me she is sorry but they don't have the money right now to pay me back because they don't have any extra money leftover after christmas. so now i have come up with enough money to pay my rent and utility bill and am out $4000. i doubt i will ever see anything close to that $4000 again.

tl;dr - parents have access to my bank account and mom took out my $4000 in loan money to pay my rent. dad spent all the money and they can't pay me back. i'm out $4000.  

edit - i have since created a new checking account online at a different bank and will be moving what money i have left into the new account and will be adding my direct deposit to the new account. thank you all for the advice so far and the support!

edit 2 - i am overwhelmed with the number of people who have pm'd me offering advice, kind words, and even offering me money or starting a gofundme. i'm amazed how much people would do for a complete stranger and can't express my gratitude enough. however, i was smart enough with my money last semester and have enough saved up to still pay my rent. i never thought i would need a rainy-day fund so soon haha. but i am okay and it would feel wrong to accept any of your money. you all are an example of how much good is in this world.",4
"by ingesting my bf's chemo. figured it out today, but have been fucking up for 3 weeks. 

bf started chemo and has been very fortunate to be feeling pretty ok. so our sex life has stayed at our normal level. probably even more active since, well, he's terminal. 

i've been having horrible nausea and headaches. i already have anxiety so i figured i'm just a mess over the cancer, kids, job stress, etc. and making myself sick. 

this morning i woke up queasy again and joked about having sympathy chemo symptoms. i google, and no that's not a thing, but secondhand chemo exposure is...through bodily fluids. symptoms include nausea and headaches. and the periods of me feeling bad line up perfectly to his treatments. 

i've been letting my dude nut poison in me folks. 

you're supposed to use condoms for several days after chemo and also not swap a bunch of spit. now that i know this it seems super obvious. but uh, guess i was too horny to think it through.

tl;dr did dirty deeds with my bf's chemo dick and got sick from it

eta: thanks for all the well wishes and debates on my stupidity. 

to answer as many questions as i can and also because i feel mildly defensive: he is stage 4, with literal dozens of bone mets. there is no cure but no timeline either. we probably have a few more years. he is in excellent care at a renowned university program. we adore his team. i've been at every appointment, taken notes, blah blah. this was not reviewed with us, only side effects. the separate bathroom/ wear gloves thing was reviewed with the couple next to us and we even wondered aloud what kind of scary chemo they were getting. we didnt read the pamphlet because this ain't his first chemo rodeo. but it is mine. so all of us, including his care team, let it slip through the cracks. we're only in our 30s but our best guess is they figured he'd be too weak for sex. or they just forgot. or they figured we'd read the info. shit happens. 

edit 2: please stop hitting on me in my dms, jesus fucking christ ",4
"by letting my boyfriend have a lie in.. obligatory just over a week ago comment. so i have been moved in with my boyfriend three weeks - it was quite sudden as we've only been together three months. and also somewhat poorly planned as one of us has a cat...and the other has a tiny parrot who genuinely believes he is a velociraptor. 

ragebeak belongs to me. it is a saturday morning, and he has commenced the daily scream at about seven - not too early and not too late but definitely too loud. still, i thought being a saturday i'd take him downstairs and cuddle/play and let my boyfriend lie in.

i fell down the stairs. still holding very small parrot and my first thought was oh god dont crush him so i threw my hands up like i just didn't care and...

i broke my back.

and then when i finally got somewhat upright and attempted to go back up the stairs (parrot is stood a few steps up completely fucking baffled by my behaviour but importantly he is neither flat or dead) i passed out from the pain, hit my head off the counter and sustained a head injury. 

woke up a bit later laid on the floor dribbling and attempted round two significantly more successfully and went to go shriek about ambulances at my boyfriend - because as it happens he sleeps like the dead and heard none of the screaming/clattering/slamming noises.

tl;dr removed parrot from bedroom so my boyfriend could have a sleep in, broke spine and woke him up with screaming of my own. right in his face.

edit - thank you all for your concern, the spinal cord itself is fine so i'm not paralyzed and there shouldn't be any life-ruining effects. i'm just on bed rest and lots of pain medication!

thanks for the silver! and gold! and the poo! and all your lovely comments/well wishes/ recommendations :)

"by getting titfucked nsfw. so setting the scene, finished my last final, tired as shit. so, what do i do go to a bar. there i am chilling and this guy buys me a drink we chat and we hit it off hes really cool hes from my home town and we just really relate to each other really well.


fast forward and were fucked hardly holding our shit together, being somewhat responsible we leave and call an uber. we went to his apartment and chilled and watched netflix and whatnot until we made a bet on some weird shit. i dont remember what it was on but if he won he would get a titjob and if i won he would get graham crackers and icing from the store and we would make those graham cracker christmas houses, yes it was spring, yes we were wasted.


so the outcome had us in bed with me lying on my back holding my tits together and him on my chest thrusting between my tits. the liquor probably helped a lot but i thought it was hot as fuck. he starts moaning and groaning a whole lot more and i close my eyes and he cums on my face and chest. not a second later i hear a girl screeching. it scares the shot out of me so i scream and open my eyes and instantly get cum in my left eye. the guy starts laughing his ass off, his girlfriend/ wife starts crying while still screaming and i'm still laying down and i cant see shit. she runs out of the house and the guy grabs a pair of pants and runs after her. 


i dont really know what i was supposed to do so i just kind of took a shower and left. their shower was really nice though. it was really tall and open and kind of looked like the top of a lighthouse.


overall
guys looks: 8/10 nice beard

sex: 9.4/10 nice and steamy 

cum in eye: ß gritty?

shower: 10/10 really cool

edit: so... i was piss drunk when i made this post and simply put i would much rather have not posted this story at all. however as people seem to be deeply intrigued in it i will leave it up. i apologize for the parts of the story that seems to be just rambling as i had quite a bit to drink last night. also, to those that gave me the awards i greatly appreciate it.",4
"tifu by accidentally revealing to my whole family that i masturbate every morning. 
this happened a couple hours ago and they're still laughing


i was visiting my parents house for dinner with my family, and almost everyone in my family *of 7*  got apple watches recently and was talking about fitness tracking and heart rate monitoring *they're all health nuts* and we got to the topic of resting heart rates and sleeping patterns and i was looking at my sleep monitoring and realized that my heart rate aggressively spikes every morning when i wake up so i brought it up with them and everyone was trying to think of what i could possibly be doing in the morning that causes my heart rate spike to an active heart rate so quickly. my sister and mom realized at the same time and started dying laughing until i realized what the first thing i do in the morning...

"tifu by having a threesome. my girlfriend and i have been together for several months now. we only see each other on weekends due to distance and work schedules, but this last weekend i fucked up. 

her friend was hanging out with us, who is also female. they were making out and grabbing on each other, and well one thing led to the next and i was involved. we went to the bed and started fucking, but before i went inside her friend, i looked at my girlfriend in the eyes and asked, ""is this okay?"" 

she said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. after a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn't find her for 15 min. 

my girlfriend was understanding and wasn't upset with me, or her friend, or so i thought. i called her the following night cause i felt extremely guilty. she said it was okay and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing. she simply asked that i never do it again. 

come this weekend, she breaks up with me over text saying she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends. i absolutely love her so much but i let lust get between us. 

i really fucked up guys..

"by ordering food online amd essentially setting restaurant on fire with the help of bee movie script. ok guys, gonna make it short. this happened like a year ago, but i just remembered it and wanned to share  


it was around noon, was feeling hungry, so i headed to my countries version of uber eats to order some nice lunch. found the food i liked, proceeded to checkout and noticed, that the box where you can leave some message for the restaurant had no limit for characters.  
so i got an idea, to ""prank"" the restaurant by copypasting entire bee movie script there, so it will get printed on the receipt. thats where the fu happened. few mins after i sent the order, got message it was canceled .. ok no big deal, might happen, so i wanned to order the some food somewhere else, when i noticed some black-ish smoke in a distance (it wasnt that far away, but was studying and didnt wanna leave my spot in library). well shortly after, also like 2 firetrucs passed by, heading the restaurants direction.

"by burning 700 lbs of marijuana and getting half of the military high.. while overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. we usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. enough pot for a lifetime. the pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. sometimes taller. it's grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. it's a remarkable sight. 

for those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, i would like to clarify… i never touched the stuff overseas. far too terrifying. they also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there's another reason to steer clear.

anyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. well one day while searching a suspected hme (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. if you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. my mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. a literal fortune. this looked like the hulk fell into a wood chipper. 

a genius counterpart suggested that we bring mt. kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. 

""well that's a clever idea!"" i thought, relieved that we wouldn't have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. 

ah but ambushed, we were. the bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. i ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. 

&#x200b;

the early effects weren't bad. the smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, tower 3. jokes went around as we awaited the results. coughing could be heard immediately and the private in tower 3 called out to us: 

""hey we need to…. we need to… do something… like… now?"" i could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. 

this was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.

""sergeant, i'm… i'm high as shit!"" he yelled moments after. i panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. 

""someone, relieve him!"" (genius)

several individuals raced to take over tower 3. we devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. how perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. like a lazy pot-nado. around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently tower 2. several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. 

""who the hell approved this!!?"" the first sergeant yelled

""i believe you did.."" the co responded 

""well where's the detail that brought it in?"" 

""that would be us first-sergeant"" myself and a couple others. i thought back to the decision-making process and realized that i had a ton of responsibility in the matter. in fact, i was *really worried.* abnormally concerned… i felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking ""ohjesusohjesusohjesus i'm going to get caught...!"" it was in that moment that i realized, i was sketching. i was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. 

i turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. my leaders did not need to see me drool. i hazily walked back toward tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other's laps, goofing off, and having a 'deep philosophical conversation' about a bug's journey through life.

inert.

i wrote tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward tower 2 to see if i could help, a big stupid smile on my face. they seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. i started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. we theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the tower 2 crew.

i assume the wind was completely dead now, as i remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. **here**(https://imgur.com/a/lvzqg8f) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.

at this point i thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. here i was reunited with half my squad. instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and i could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. 

although i was personally quite effected, i think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. a lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. i did not personally see it. i came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where i belonged. i theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. no repercussions followed.

 

tl;dr – tried to burn a bunch of contraband, the wind shifted and the contraband burned us.",4
"by accidentally assaulting a child in a public park. so today was pretty f*cking eventful. 

first, obligatory backstory: my best friend and i often go out on weekends, get drunk, party at clubs, etc. it's a lot of fun when everyone's enjoying themselves and letting loose. one weekend, my best friend's older brother came home from croatia ( first time in a couple years) to catch-up with the fam and had plans with him to go out on the weekend. he offers me if i want to come but i want them to have quality bro time so i pass, truly wanting them to catch-up and have some family time.

it just so happened that weekend of all weekends that my best friend (we'll call him l) got into a fight with another group of guys. although he and his bro didn't sustain too much damage from the fight (the other group were wasted from alcohol and pills) l and i got into talking about joining a martial arts gym. it would be for fun and fitness, plus, learning how to defend yourself seemed smart.

we caught up and chilled at a local public playground (keep in mind, imagine two grown ass young adults climbing up and around a tiny playground in broad daylight) and began discussing joining a local kickboxing gym. being best friends, we started talking some sh*t, saying how much we'd deck the other and how we'd essentially easily f*ck the other up. we began to mock fight in public with parents and children walking by on the sidewalk with amusement tinged with judgement. 

it was just two 18yr olds messing around. 

all of a sudden, i say something stupid in a mock japanese accent (i'm asian.. chill) and proceed to attempt a jumping, flying, roundhouse, no-idea-where-the-f*ck-my-legis-going kick at l, when this child that couldn't be over 8 jumps in and says ""hiiyaahh""

i couldn't stop my momentum and proceeded to yeet this kid into the sandpit... 

no amount of bracing could protect our ears from the banshee scream that erupted from his mouth.

i went into instant panic mode, running to the kid to check on him. he wasn't seriously injured, but my leg collided pretty hard. 

his older brother or something came over, laughing his ass off. i apologised profusely to both the kid and his brother, and when he stopped crying i talked him up about how strong he was to take such a ass whoopin.

his bro lightly scolded him for running into an area where two tall dipshits were flailing their legs and fists. all in all, it was pretty wholesome, the child had a new story to tell at school, and i got to kick a child in the face... win-win.      (that's a joke)

tl:dr
best friend and i were pretend fighting in a public park and when i attempted to do a ridiculous kick i saw on ufc, a kid jumped in and became collateral damage. worth it.

edit: holy shit, thanks for the silver and gold, i am not worthy of this. i made this post at 12am last night and when i woke up, i was not prepared for the absolute ass load of humorous and kind comments. 

i appreciate you all!

edit #2: i didn't make one point clear enough regarding the playground. besides people walking past the area on the sidewalk, the playground was empty. l and i made sure that our presence wasn't making anyone scared or uncomfortable, if there were children already playing, we wouldn't have even entered the playground area at all.

hope that kinda clears some shiz up",4
"by unintentionally betraying the trust of my new kitten. (nsfw)?. obligatory, wasn't today, but 2 days ago.

so my gf and i adopted a new kitten a week ago. she's a very curious kitten, as many are and she always has to be wherever my girlfriend or i go. she also has very little concern for personal space so that also makes for some interesting moments.

well my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and i had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as i had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. so i went into the bathroom and began to pee. as i was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all i could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. i looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. i started screaming ""oh fuck!"" and managed to pinch off my stream. the kitten didnt seem to mind getting wet via golden shower, but as soon as i pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. this all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.

it took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. i set her in the tub and i had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. i got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. the last few nights i've woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. i dont know what shes planning, but i'm sure she'll get her payback sooner or later.

my girlfriend thinks it's the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she's still a little salty that i pissed on our new kitten..

tl:dr - i gave my first and hopefully last, golden shower.... to my new kitten...

"when using the shower head to masturbate. alrighty it's now the morning after;  i am so embarrassed with myself and my hubby won't stop laughing at me. 

last night hubby & i had our first child free night in over 6 months (thanks for baby sitting grandma) & headed over to a friends place for a bbq & drinks around the bonfire. 

as usual, as the night progresses the conversation turns to the topic of sex & masturbation. one of my girls friends starts talking about using the shower head to... you know 😉

as a 35 year old woman i had literally never thought to use the shower head for any other pleasure than washing my body. sure, i have toys (i'm no prude) but i had never thought about using an everyday home appliance for my own pleasure down there. 

the night ended and we went home. smelling of the bonfire i tell hubby i'm having a shower & he says he doesn't care, he's going to bed. 

i should admit i was pretty tipsy by the time we got home (we took an uber in case anyone's concerned we drove under the influence). 

i'm washing myself  and my hair and the thought hits me. ok, imma try the shower head... 

ok feels good but need more pressure.. 

ok feels better but i could still use more pressure.. 

ohh ok that's just right. yeah that's the spot... oh yeah that's the spot!!!!! 

...screaming: ahhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuccckkkk! 

just as i was having a mind blowing orgasm, my leg jerked and gave way. i slid to the left and went crash right into the shower screen, smashing it as i managed to land out of the shower holding myself planking on the toilet. 

hubby came running in and i'm telling you it was a fucking sight. 

i'm planked from the shower across the toilet (in like a stiff leaning position), glass everywhere, a bit of blood and a shower head just dangling from the wall going at full speed while i'm crying from the pain and laughing from the embarrassment. 

i fucked up y'all. 

it takes hubby a few seconds to compose himself because he thinks this is the funniest shit that's ever happened. 

i managed only a few cuts to my left arm from basically flying with the glass onto the toilet and a few cuts on my feet. lucky.

anyway we went to the ed because i did have a few decent cuts but i only ended up needing 2 stitches in my arm and 3 on the side of my foot from where some glass got stuck. again, lucky. 

i told the nurse & doctor that i slipped while cleaning the shower. you know, because most people clean their shower at 1am. 

i'll be telling our landlord the same thing today. 

tl;dr went to town on myself with the shower head, as i orgasmed i slipped and fell through the shower screen and went to the ed for a few stitches.

edit: changed the tldr for u/nemyosel - hope this eases some pain mate

edit: thanks for reading about my misfortune, for sharing your stories and for having a laugh with (and at) me. thanks for the awards too. 

to answer the biggest question: i was embarrassed and panicked when i said i was cleaning and slipped rather than just saying i slipped. stupid i know, but none of us are perfect. 

to all the men jealous of the female clit, just remember you can pee anywhere with ease and we can't so you've got that 😂

to the people who criticized my writing style, my overuse of the word hubby, who think i'm a man, who slid into my dms just to slut shame me & tell me off- fucking hell just get over it and scroll on by. i'm not responding to anyone who attacks me, it's pretty sad you've got nothing better to do than bring negativity where it's just not needed. 

i've also learnt that the shower head seems to be the most common way for us females to get off and i've learnt a lot about how to do it safely so thank you!",4
"by going blind and posting in r/pics. by going blind and posting in r/pics 

a friendly redditor u/kevindavebob suggested i post on so thank you for the great idea (and for being nice to me). this is certainly a and it all just happened so i'm still feeling pretty terrible about it.

i have a rare disease called usher syndrome that is causing me to go blind and deaf. one of the ways i cope with having this disease is by traveling whenever i can to create visual memories before i go blind. i went to iceland to try to see the northern lights. i can't even begin to describe the feeling of actually being able to see the northern lights. i didn't know if it would be too late for me to see them. 

i really wanted to share my story about going blind and seeing the northern lights, hoping to generate awareness for usher syndrome. only having a phone camera and being a very amateur photographer, i certainly can't capture the beauty and experience of witnessing the lights. i was able to find a public use image on the internet that would properly convey my story and experience. the photo has been linked so many times that i didn't spend time searching for the original source (you can see where this is going….).

with my genuine caption, generic photo, and source to my story and blog (no ads) in the comments, i posted in r/pics. i chatted with a few kind redditors about my story and was really happy to see people learning about usher syndrome. then i went to sleep….

well, all hell broke loose.

my post made it to the front page of r/all. #1 in fact. i woke up to thousands of hurtful messages and comments – calling me a liar and telling me i don't have my disease, redditors telling me they're happy i'm going blind if it is true, that i should kill myself, etc. (there were some way worse ones i won't write here).

i wish the mods took my post down while i was sleeping but it made it to the front page and stayed up for some reason despite reddit telling me i was a fraud. it then got posted to r/quityourbullshit where i got even more hate. i didn't say it was my picture, but i didn't credit the photographer. i seriously fucked up.

i can't even tell you guys how upset all of this made me. living with usher syndrome is not easy. there is no cure and it's terrifying losing both my vision and my hearing. my vision especially. i want nothing more than to try to raise awareness for usher syndrome to discover a cure. not just for myself, but for everyone else who also has to live with this rare disease. 

i was so focused on my mission to raise awareness and share my story, i didn't make the effort to credit the photographer the way i should have. i fucked up reddit. 

i am getting so much hate now, even outside of reddit from people finding me on my blog and other social accounts just to attack me. i'm sad that my post which intended to raise awareness for usher syndrome turned into fuel for such negativity. we have too much negativity in this world and it's got to stop at some point. 

thank you to everyone who was understanding and realized i made a mistake. thank you luke stackpoole for making your beautiful photo free for the public to use. i'm sorry for not taking the time to find you and credit you before. your entire portfolio https://www.withluke.com/ is stunning.

from the bottom of my heart, i am sorry for misleading everyone and not posting correctly on r/pics.

i really did fuck up, though. 


tldr; i tried to raise awareness for usher syndrome by posting a picture on r/pics and failing to credit the photographer, luke stackpoole. my post made it to the front page and reddit now hates me.

edit: a nice redditor (u/omichandralekha) suggested i share the non-profit that donates to usher syndrome research so here you go (no need to click on it if you don't want to, it just takes you to the homepage of this non-profit where you can learn more about it all) - the usher syndrome society: www.ushersyndromesociety.org. also, full disclosure: i am on the board of directors and it's a pretty amazing organization!",4
"by escaping an escape room.. a friend-of-a-friend has apparently been into escape rooms for a while now, and finally decided to create his own as a halloween party experience for his friends.

since i don't know him, and wouldn't realistically be coming to the party, i agreed to take part in a test along with three other random folks that had been gathered for the dry run. it ended up being a group of four people who totally didn't know each other at all, as opposed to any sort of cohesive group of friends or employees.

our host told us a ton of rules and guidelines. don't break anything, no answers are hidden on or in something you have to ruin in order to see it, and so on. he was going to stand inside the room with us, but was to be ignored as if he wasn't there. this was in case we needed any direction or if we started doing something against the rules. he wore a black mask and black clothing.

immediately at the start of the game, everyone got quiet and started looking around slowly. as i mentioned, no one knew each other - and it was really awkward. i didn't want to be the ""guy who's super excited to lead the group"", and i guess they didn't either.

the escape room was history-themed. computer-printed photos of historical figures and explorers on the walls, a cheap dollar store style globe on an end table, and so on. lots of books stacked around.

the first thing i did was look at the combination lock on the door, which had four numbered rollers.

i put in the first relevant number i thought of, 1492, the date christopher columbus landed in the americas.

lock opens.

things got a thousand times more awkward.

i apologized and explained the situation to the host, who told me to sit down for the duration, re-locked  the door, and asked the remaining guests to figure out where the combination was hidden. the host was incredibly angry, but only in so much as i could hear it in his voice and see it in how he moved - mainly closing and re-locking the door hard. he didn't call me out for doing an obviously brain-dead thing and didn't say anything rude.

soonafter, i decided it'd be better if i just left, apologizing again.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - put the first thing that came to mind into a combination lock, ruined an escape room.

&#x200b;

**edit:** was told second-hand that he was (is?) mad i tried the lock right away instead of engaging with the puzzles at all. i can see how that can be considered a dick move, personally, but i appreciate everyone assuring me i didn't fu. i agree with you on principle i suppose, but i also can see how going directly for the lock was rude in a certain light. the escape room was ""intended to be easier than normal"" for the guests, the majority of whom haven't done one before. dunno if that's legit or an excuse, of course. thanks for all the positive responses!!",4
"by wearing the wrong size shoes for my entire adult life.. okay, so by standards, this is pretty tame, but considering the years of agony i unintentionally put myself through, i think it qualifies.

i have fairly weird-sized feet.  they're very wide, but not all that long.  i have no arch to speak of.  i'm a fairly short guy, about 5'7"", and that has always played a role in my shoe size selection.  i'm pretty short so i should be wearing a fairly small size, right?

wrong.

when i was a kid, my mom would measure the new shoes she bought for me by pressing the toe and making sure i had about a half-inch to an inch of space to grow into.

as an adult, i assumed, well, since i'm full-grown, i should buy shoes in which my toes reach all the way to the end.  for me, that's a size 10 (us).

problem was, i kept blowing out the sides of the shoes with my wide-ass feet... no problem, i'll switch to size 10w.

still no luck.  still blowing the sides out of them and suffering chronic foot pain.  my running shoes were so ill-fitted that i actually suffered a hairline fracture from running with my pancake feet jammed into those narrow little torture chambers.

my friend was getting rid of a bunch of stuff he didn't need, including a pair of really nice brand-new size 11.5w nikes.  i said, ""sure, fuck it, i'll take them, let's see how they fit.""

oh.  my.  god.

it was like wearing pillows made of clouds on my feet.  i was walking on cotton candy and unicorn farts.  i had no idea how much misery i had been in until i wore those shoes.  i wonder now if some of my poor life decisions have just been because i was in a bad mood because of so much needless foot pain and didn't realize it.  there's about 3/4 of an inch of room in the toes but that doesn't bother me at all.

tl;dr - i'm almost 36, and for fully 18 years i have been wearing shoes a size and a half too small because i was too much of an idiot to try on larger shoes.",4
"by making everyone in the elevator think that they were going to die.. alright, so this is an old story, but when i found this sub, i had to share.

when i used to be a muslim, i had an app on my phone that would sound the adhaan, when it was time for prayer.

i was on holiday the day of the fuckup. i got into a hotel elevator, this was shortly after the paris attacks. there were roughly six people in it. then the adhaan for prayer started blasting from my phone. for those who don't know, the adhaan starts with allahu akbar. when that blasted from my phone, the elevator went into mass hysteria, people were crying, screaming, another man tackled me and held me down. i had to explain to them that i wasn't a terrorist. then everyone just started laughing.

i understand that everyone may think this isn't a fuckup, but i feel like i shouldn't have had my adhaan blasting like that after an incident like the paris attacks.

tl;dr: adhaan blares in elevator, everyone thinks i'm about to blow up the elevator.

thanks to the people who awarded me silvers and gold:)

i need to clear some stuff up first:

when i meant laugh, (ik, that segment was worded horribly) i'm not referring to full out laughter. just some chuckling and light laughing(if that's even a thing)

please stop with all these questions about my religion, let me make this clear, if you message me about my religion, i will not respond. so stop.

and one gripe, a large amount of negative comments,  in most of them the person commenting doesn't seem to understand the full magnitude of the incident and why it provoked that response, please take the effort to fucking understand what i wrote first :)

and to all the haters who are send messages to me calling this story fake, i really don't care if you think my story is real or not. i'm not here to argue  about whether this actually happened.",4
"by going to bed drunk.. so last night i went out as i do every saturday.
when i got there i met up with my friends and started the night with a couple of beers, but ended the night with a bit more than i could handle. after that i went straight home and instantly fell asleep on the couch as i was trying to lay down on it ""just to rest for a moment"".

i woke up around 5 today and my right arm felt a bit weird. it was cold and i couldn't move it at all.
at first i didn't panic at all because this has happened to me before because i sometimes sleep with my arm under my head. however today i slept with my arm under the side of my body ( i got a little over 100kg/220 lbs) with my back against the back-rest of the couch. after about 20 minutes of relaxing and massaging the arm with little to no signs of improvement i woke up my parents and after i explained my situation, my mom (who is a doctor) suggested we go to the hospital immediately.

during my 2 hour stay at the hospital the arm became significantly better as the time went on.
however my fingers and my wrist (not nearly as much as fingers but it still felt a bit off) movement were problematic. after getting some tests done on the arm nerves (which i hope i never do again) i waited for the results. a little over an hour passes and the doctor came back with the results. 

it appears that i have done damage to a nerve with my hip while i was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (i'm right handed) fingers . at first the doctor didn't know how i managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after i told him what i have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn't end up this badly.

now i'm sitting at home writing this one-handed on my phone contemplating life just because of two beers too much.

tl;dr: drunkenly fell asleep in a bad position and permanently damaged my arm nerves.",4
"by falling deeply in love with my own smell.. this didn't really happen today, more like over the course of the past 4 years. this is a throwaway because i'm very embarrassed. sorry about formatting, i'm typing this on mobile. my girlfriend of 3 years passed away in a car accident about 4 years ago. it was a horrible event and i still haven't been able to get back into the game since. i was and still am very much in love with her. now to the fuck up.

my favorite possession of all time is her pillow. it smells like her, and i usually sleep with it every night. i haven't washed it out of fear of losing the smell (i know, gross but i don't think straight anymore). i hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. but this morning when i went for a particularly long morning run i started smelling the smell. really strong. it confused me but i wasn't going to start complaining.

this morning, about 20 minutes ago i arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. and the smell grew more pungent. this was the moment i realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, i got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. i'm embarrassed and distraught that the smell i thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.

tl;dr- slept with my passed away girlfriends pillow for 4 years, and have fallen in love with my man sweat.

"by being accidentally racist. so this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.



recently ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so i thought i'd go along. 

so anyway here i am about to play my first game of chess ever. i sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (i should now mention my opponent was african american). the chess teacher says ""first rule of chess, whites go first."" 

i think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. 

so i grab a pawn and slide it forward, then i look up expecting my opponent to make his move. instead i'm met with a look of confusion and horror, i begin to hear laughter from the people watching. 

i then realize my error ""oooh you meant the pieces"" i murmur. 
the teacher nods. 

now everyone thinks i'm a massive racist.

"by dating my cousin for 5 months. you hear this story millions of times of people unknowingly hooking up with their relatives and finding out about this atrocity in the most awkward ways, and mine was no exception.. even had to create a new account cause it is so embarrassing 

i was talking to this guy on hinge who had the softest of hazel eyes, and at the time, i thought he was the one. after exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. we dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...

since we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn't had time to meet each other's parents. instead of doing the traditional, i'll bring you over to meet my parents, and i'll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. you can pretty much tell where this story goes now. 

long story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend's mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(uncle's daughter). it took her a second to realize as well. since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn't seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and i moved to the same city. we could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn't right to do. that was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family. i told my friends that it didn't work out and silently removed everything from social media..

"by leaving my ear tubes in for 13 years and not realizing my hearing was going to be different when i took them out. happened this week and i just read another user's post about breathing through one nostril and i felt inspired to share my own story.

context: i've had tubes in my ears my whole life, 24 of my 25 years. my childhood is filled with eat eat infections, vaccuums, drops, 6 nurses holding me down as i fought them off, and surgery. i've had 5 to 8 sets of tubes in my ears. my mom and i honestly lost count because there were just too many. my last tube set was put in when i was in 5th grade i believe. i was around 10 or 11. 

i've lived my entire life with them and they've never caused problems. in fact they've helped a few times! i feel absolutely no pressure in my ears on airplanes because the tubes equalize pressure slowing me to be fine. it's awesome. 

so here's where the issues started. 4 months ago i started waking up to watery ears, which for me is a really bad sign. i ignored it because at this point in my life ent doctors give me a lot of anxiety. but the symptoms started getting worse so last month i bit the bullet and went in. i saw the same doctor i had seen and a child. i couldn't believe he was still alive! he told me i developed a polyp on my tube and it's been in there so long he wants to remove it. i knew this day would come so i agreed.

my surgery was last thursday and immediately post op i realized things were off. my ear popped more times than i could count and i realize i feel air pressure now - no more carefree plane rides. my hearing was incredibly sensitive as well. usually i blast my damn music in my car but now i drive around at 6 volume. and finally my voice has changed. the way i sound to myself it's completely different to what i've come to know over the course of my life. i can't really tell if i'm whispering or shouting just yet because i've never heard this voice before and it's going to take some getting used to. the kicker is that the doctor only removed my right tube, so now my hearing feels...uneven. i guess having something in my ear canal for 24 years effected my hearing -  who would have guessed?! i genuinely did not. 

parents: please remove your child's ear tubes before they reach adulthood. 

edit: thank you for the gold! thank you so much for the platinum!!! thank you for the silver!!! 

tldr: i've lived my entire life with tubes in my ears and they were effecting my life in more ways than i realized.",4

"by not openning a gift for 1.5 years. this actually happened some time ago but thinking about it is still quite painful.. i was in uni and made friend with this really cute girl in my senior year at an event. we got on well and i was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country i decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. i thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so i kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.

in the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. it was all a blur but i kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what i think. well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided not to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). we met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but i was prepared and considered that was it.

the box stayed in my fridge for i dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? she went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and i also met somebody else. one day i was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously i still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then i saw a full page note from her. she basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.

i just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. i probably looked like an asshole for how i acted when i last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am i..

"by changing a client's desktop background to sexy pikachu. this just happened 2 hours ago.


i work for an it company that services many small/medium businesses. i'm in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. we like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.


i had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his pc unlocked. i sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. i quickly pulled up ie and googled ""sexy pikachu"". found the one(http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/43/92/289186d67dc19661daf4a44b700f343a.jpg), right clicked, and set as background. then i went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. standard stuff.


i quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. he notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. then he says, ""hey, i'm remoted into a client's computer. you changed their background, not mine.""


i shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, ""hey, i have jane doe on the phone. she says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it."" jane doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. i also believe she's the owner's daughter. at first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he's not. he's just basking in the moment of instant karma. 


i stand there for a good 30 seconds before i say ""ok, send her over to me."" i'm a director and i have a working relationship with jane doe, so it's really best i talk to her.


i answer the phone. i listen to what she has to say. she had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. she attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new pc and she wants to know what's going on. i tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. i apologize for it, i tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won't happen again. thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. i hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  i've spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like ""hey, i'm locking my computer for you"" or ""hey, i'm remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?""


tl;dr tried to change coworker's desktop background to sexy pikachu, accidentally changed it on a client's pc he was connected to instead. main point of contact for that client saw the background and immediately called in wanting to talk to a manager. am manager.",4
"by jerking off and forgetting my petcam was faced directly at me. so i want to just say this is 100% true and 100% embarrassing. 


so i usually have monday's off and spend the day doing homework, tidying up, playing video games, and today... jerking off. i don't usually feel inclined to do this however today i had the urge. it was about an hour before my girlfriend got home so i definitely had time. i go into my room and get into bed and start skimming thru ol' faithful aka pornhub. 

i finally find a video worth b'ing my l to and get down to business. as i'm about to... ya know... i get an alert on my phone that my girlfriend had just accessed the petcam we have in our room that's on our dresser. (we got this petcube camera for christmas so we can watch our two dogs while we are at work/school/out.) i immediately stop, now knowing that my girlfriend just witnessed me jerking it mid-monday so i text her ""........"" . she doesn't answer for about 2 minutes and then i see that she's calling me. 

now we've been together 2.5 years so this isn't like a make or break thing and i honestly thought that although it was slightly embarrassing, it was also pretty funny. so i answer the phone laughing, ready for this to be something we joke about for a long time to come. unfortunately, i was sadly mistaken to this being ""funny"". she tells me that her co-workers had asked about our dogs and she wanted to show them on our awesome petcam! but instead of two cute dogs on our bed, it was just me with my shorts down at my ankles, going to town on myself! so needless to say i don't think i'll be invited to any of her work christmas parties in the future.

tl;dr : decided to crank it before my girlfriend got home and forgot my petcam was faced directly at me. she wanted to show her co-workers our dogs and instead showed them me jerking it in our bed.

edit: lmao just some clarification... she's shown coworkers before because they love our dogs and ask to see them because it's ""cute"" to see them live and sleeping. also, in her defense, i told her i was doing homework and what not so the last thing to cross her mind was me yankin it probably. also the cam is tucked in the corner so i forget it's even there most the time. (b'ing my l = blowing my load)

edit 2 (last one) : for everyone saying ""why would you have a petcam facing your bed?"" that's where our dogs are 90% of the time. when we are out of the house, that's where we leave them. when we are home, that's mostly where they want to be unless we're on the couch with them. don't you think we put the camera there..... for a reason? lol and btw, my gf and i are fine! she was freaked out about it at first but now it's already funny. that's why i love her so much lol so take it easy on her, we both fucked up!


last and final edit:

not that i need to prove anything but this is for people asking to see them. (it's a great dane and am-staff btw)

"by walking in on my teenaged son masterbating.. this just happened and i am still wishing it didn't.   my  15 year old son and i are home, i'm working on a puzzle and making dinner, he is playing fortnite.   he disappears for a little while and i go to find him.    i didn't really need him for anything, just wanted to say 'hi' since we had both been doing our own things for most of the day.

i start walking down the hallway towards his room—our house isn't super big and i knew he was in there.   the lights in both the hallway and his room were off and it was pretty dark in the hall, but i could see the light from his phone and knew he was lying on his bed looking at his phone.

i decided to be funny and flip on the light and flop down on his bed.   he was lying with his back to me, i could tell by where his phone was.   as i am airborne, leaping over him onto the far side of his bed, i see it.   my son's boner.   as i was flipping on the light, he was rolling towards the door while pulling up his underwear and grabbed a blanket.   it all happened so fast and i was already airborne before i realized what was happening.   i did not see actual flesh, but definitely saw my teenaged son's boner through his boxer briefs.   

the entire situation was horrifying, for both of us, i'm sure.   i have no idea what he was looking at on his phone, and i don't want to.

at that point, i am still flopped down on his bed.   both of us are well aware that i just saw him whacking off.    both of us figuring out how to get the fuck out of there.   i say, 'dinner is almost ready.'   (it wasn't)
he said, 'ok, i'll be out in a minute.'
i said, 'no hurry.'

now i'm standing in my kitchen, typing furiously to reddit and wondering how much therapy he'll need if he ever finds out i posted about this to a bunch of strangers and wondering why don't boys close the door when they are masturbating?  

tl/dr:   basically the title.     

edit: spelling.   dammit, i can't change the spelling of 'masturbating' in the title.   oh well.   i fixed 'fortnite' though.   

edit 2:  for those asking:

—i am mom.
—i want to be clear, i have absolutely no issue with him jerking off.   i am a nurse.   i talk to my boys openly about sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.   the horrifying part is that i walked in on him.   that was not ideal.  for either one of us.  
—his door was open.  
—i have obviously learned my lesson and will knock all the way down the hall, send smoke signals, text him, wear bells on my shoes, etc, before i walk into his room, door open or not, from this point forward.   
—he isn't on any social media.   i am quite confident that his identity is protected.

edit 3:   for anyone still interested...

thank you (almost) everyone for taking this as it was:  an embarrassing moment which has most definitely taught both my son and i lessons about boundaries and privacy.    

wow.   i now know what 'rip my inbox' feels like.   i had no idea reddit would be so into my awkward moment.

for those who sent creepy shit to my inbox, just no.

and an update:   there is no weirdness.   we went straight back to the status quo, had dinner and just continued about our night.   i didn't act weird and neither did he.   ",4
"by telling my best friend i love her when i thought i was going to die. throwaway because i don't want this to be on my main account:


obbligatory ""this didn't happen today but happened last week yadda yadda yadda""

also please forgive my spelling mistakes because i'm in the hospital and writing this on mobile out of boredom of there being not much to do here.

so, last week i was driving casually on the country road close to my house on holiday back home for the summer after my second year of college. i wasn't paying too much attention (i assume some responsibility) and wasn't wearing a seat belt. yes i'm an idiot i know lesson learned. wear your seat belts kids! anyway, it was just starting to rain and i saw a kid about to go into the road. for the life of me i still don't know why he thought it would he a good idea to go onto a quite highly trafficked country road so casually, but eh life is full of surprises. i was caught completely off guard and swerved into the opposing lane to avoid him, and promptly got hit head on by the car coming towards me.

now, i was going quite fast and as i said, did not have a seat belt on. next thing i knew i was out of my car and couldn't feel anything anymore. no pain, no panic, nothing. i just saw blood and felt the biggest adrenaline rush i've ever had in my life. i just laid there, not knowing what to do. i heard voices come towards me but didn't really know what they were saying, and couldn't really respond. i thought i was going to die. there was a lot of blood.

you know how they say your life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die? well that didn't quite happen but i did start thinking about who i care about and who i love. here's where i tell you about my best friend. a girl i've been in love with for around two years, i never let her know and never intended too. she is in a happy relationship she's had since her teens and i didn't want to ruin it, and if she's happy i'm happy. there's no point meddling in things bigger than you and some things aren't meant to be. but i thought i was literally dying, and all i could think about was her in those moments. the pain was starting to kick in but i was just thinking about how she'd never know how much i loved her.

i realised my phone was still in my pocket, and with all the force i could muster i took it out. it was intact and it felt like it took ages but the only message i could sent was an ""i love you"" to her. i thought that would be the last message i'd ever send.

i don't remember much after that. days have been a blur. i've had quite a few operations, aki due to trauma and a ruptured spleen. but my legs are starting to work again and my face looks like i got in a fight with a lion but it's slowly improving! all i do is sleep and appreciate the fact i'm alive. the other driver and the kid were okay btw.
anyway, as you can see, i did indeed live and didn't die (so far), but i can't undo that message i sent. i've been in a lot of pain this past week, and haven't had the energy to confront the situation. i told her about the accident, and what happened, and we talked briefly but mainly about my lovely hospital experience. earlier today she sent me a message telling me we have to talk about that message. i haven't replied yet and i don't want to. i don't know what to do. so far i've been writing this as procrastination and then after this i plan on taking a long nap. thank you all for your attention, nap time calls me.



tldr: got in a car accident and while i was bleeding out i told my crush best friend i love her. she's in a 10 year relationship and i haven't talked to her about it since and it's destroying me.



edit: god guys this blew up so much!!! i only wrote this to procrastinate the inevitable conversation you guys are amazing jeez thanks for all the advice and support!!

so i spoke to her... over the phone because we're college friends and she lives far away right now. i decided that the best thing i could do at this point was just tell her the truth. i didn't expect anything and i didn't want anything to come out of it, but i just thought that to have a pure and true friendship everything needs to be out there or it just wouldn't be legitimate. i would love to tell you guys an amazing fairytail story that would give you guys all hope for the future and whatnot, but i guess life is just different from movies...

i told her how i felt in pretty much the same words as in this post. but i also added, and it's true, that i've gotten to know her boyfriend for the past few years and he's great. i don't want to hurt him or interfere as much as i want her happy. i think she understood where i came from and the circumstances in which those words were said. i hope nothing will change with her because i love spending time with her and neither of us can immagine life without eachother anymore, we both admitted that. so i guess i just have to give you the boring response... but it's reality so sorry if it sucks... im okay with though, i really didn't expect anything and still kind of think i was being selfish. we talked about a lot of other things like we normally do for a couple of hours after that and she might be coming to visit me in the hospital this weekend! she said she'll try and make the trip, even though i told her not to because it's gonna be extremely expensive for her last minute... she was really flattered though i think and almost cried thinking she was the last thing i thought about when i thought i was going to die",4
"by letting my cat put his head in my mouth.. throwaway account for obvious reasons. this just happened a few minutes ago. i was laying on my couch and my cat decided to jump up and lay on my chest as he often does. i had just eaten lunch, which was a chicken salad sandwich, so naturally my cat was intrigued by the smell and wanted to get a good whiff. he was sniffing around my face heavily, almost comically. i was feeling pretty generous at that time so i got the brilliant idea to open my mouth really wide to let him enjoy, but also because i was curious how far he would venture in. you know, normal pet owner stuff. he got his head about halfway in when suddenly he decided to let out a violent and very wet sneeze right into my mouth. i'm fucking disgusted, and the weekend has been ruined before it even started. 

tl;dr: my cat sneezed directly in my mouth.",4
"by plagiarizing from my own reddit post and getting threatened to be dropped from my university. ***background***

i am a very passionate writer. i *had* an account that was just for writing prompts. every week i would go to that sub and write long detailed stories.  

***story time***

last year, on r/writingprompts, someone gave a prompt idea that revolved around a student who one day became rich. i forget the full details, but it intrigued me and i wrote a 6-page story about it. anyways, that post didn't gain any traction (which sucked), but i still had a 6-page short story just sitting on that reddit post.

**^((it was on a different account, which is no longer alive))**

***present*** 

so a few weeks ago, my writing class professor gave the class an assignment that was literally about the same idea. so i was like, okay sweet i don't need to spend any time on this project. i went over to that account, copied the text, put it into a word document and submitted. to be sure i don't get into any trouble, i delete the account, forgetting that it wouldn't delete all my comments. 

yesterday, i get an email from the professor saying i need to meet with the dean immediately. at this point, i am shitting my pants. she told me that i stole someone else's work and i could be withdrawn from my program. i try to explain but i have no proof that it was my work because i no longer live at home and i wrote it on an old laptop. i have a meeting with the head of the university later today. i am so fucking scared. i am currently driving home to find that fucker.  

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i copied and pasted my own work from my own reddit post, which caused my assignment to show up as plagiarized. could be withdrawn from my program


edit 1: 17:00 i found my original work. took me an hour of going through files on a slow laptop. travelling back now, meeting is in 3 hours. i'm okay with taking a zero, obviously, i just hope they can reason. 

also, i can't show the reddit emails because i never had a real email for the account. 

edit 2: success! i brought my old laptop to the university principal and provided proof that i was the one to write the story. they were skeptical, but the dates matched up with what i told them before. they asked me why i did this and asked me to tell them why it was not okay to do this. i told them it was a lack of understanding and apologized. 

*results*

i am not kicked out, and i am actually given another chance at the project. my professor told me he actually enjoyed the story lol. 


thanks everyone who supported me through this! i won't do this again. i'm sorry. 


also, thanks u/squid_fucker for the suggestion

> just read all the edits.  you know what you should do, is incorporate all this into the story.  if the idea is about a student getting rich all of a sudden, write a story about a student who plagiarizes a story for a writing assignment and it takes off and gets published and he becomes insanely wealthy off of it but the guilt over who the original author drives him mad.


maybe this will be the plot of the new story. ",4
"by saying the worst possible thing in a restaurant. this happened a few hours ago in a busy buffet restaurant in a hotel in austria.

being a buffet restaurant, people were pretty much always wandering from table to food and back again, so there was a constant steam of mainly austrian and german people passing our table. we've been here a few days, you start to recognise people and my two young sons have made a few friends.

i was joking with the kids  that i'd left their nintendo switch at home, they suspected i was joking but went along with it anyway. so when i told them i had brought it they wanted to check.

""i brought it,"" i said 

""our switch?""

""yes, our switch""

""what?!! our switch?!""

""yes!! our switch!!""

they got louder and we started just repeating it, laughing. i noticed my wife frowning at me, or past me, it didn't really register.

""our switch?""

""our switch! ha!""

then my wife really started signalling to me to shut up - i was like ""it's ok... it's a buffet""

""our switch! ha!""

""our switch!""

then my wife leaned in and urgently whispered ""it sounds like you are all shouting auschwitz""

my whole body went cold with the realisation.

needless to say i immediately stopped, placed my hand on my eldest son's knee and he - seeing the look on my face-  stopped straight away - the 3 year old did one final shout before i could stop him... 

i have avoided eye contact with all other hotel guests since. 

tldr: shouted ""auschwitz"" loudly, happily, repeatedly,  in a restaurant full of germans and austrians. i'm really sorry.

edit: thank you for the gold and silver kind strangers! my first. to those calling bs: i wish it was. to the genial germans and austrians assuring me of the reduced risk of horror due to pronunciation, sincere thanks - i will sleep better tonight because of you. and for the few offended at us shouting in a buffet: it's a kinderhotel. kind of like if michael bay did buffets.

edit2: just to all my salty comrades telling me i'm a ""scum cunt"", that my kids will grow up to assholes because we were loud. i fucking love you reddit! i'm reassured that you are all so considerate when it comes to noise in public spaces. you wouldn't like this restaurant ... stone walls, stone floors, a hotel designed for kids. it's like a school playground where they've all been given metal objects to smash together but louder. our risky exchange was lost in the cacophony to anyone who wasn't walking past our table..",4
"by teaching my 4 year old about static electricity. so it was rather cold today and i put some nice, thick wool socks on my 4 year old son.  after running around a bit today, he came and gave me a hug.... zaaap.  

i explained to him that he's got to pick up his feet because dragging them on the carpet will build up a ""shock"".  my son looks at me and says ""like pikachu?""

a bit of background.  a few months ago i discovered that disney now has the full run of all pokemon episodes.  like 20+ seasons, each of over 40 episodes.  my son and i have slowly been working our way through them, like 3-4 episodes per week.  my wife and i decided to get a switch as a family gift for christmas, along with let's go pikachu.  for my son's birthday a few weeks ago, we got him a pikachu plushie as that would fit in well.  

so a bit after my talk to my son about static electricity, he goes to his room and grabs his pikachu plushie.  drags his feet all the way to the office where my wife is playing frostpunk and says ""donder shok!!"" while zotting her with a nice snappy static shock.  

as he runs away, clutching his plushie, all i can say to my wife was ""i think pikachu's been teaching him some tricks"".  she was not amused.  



tl;dr - pikachu taught my son thunder shock.  my wife is not happy about this development.  


edit:  my first gold!  thank you kind stranger!

edit 2:  i know this may be more cute than traditionally tifu, but i'm rather singed at the moment and the wife wasn't too pleased at the time.   i know she'll be laughing about it in a day or two with the rest of us (i hope). 

edit 3:  my first platinum!  thank you my friend.  ",4
"by almost murdering my friend and stopping a school-wide arms race.. so this happened about eight years ago in the sixth grade. now, if you remember sixth grade, you know that trends fly in and out of style every other week. and just before sillybands took over as chief tween pimp currency, the big thing at my school was a trend we dubbed ""locker artillery"". basically, we gathered all the supplies we could from anywhere in the classrooms, and created small projectile weapons from what we scavenged. we would use these weapons to lob erasers, spitballs, and paper hornets at ourselves and unsuspecting teachers.

eventually, things got out of hand. it became a grade-wide arms race to create the ultimate launching machine. heists were performed on teacher's desks. books were destroyed and scrapped for ammunition. students presented welts from paper hornets with the same pride one would display a hickey from a cheerleader. rubber bands were contraband. it was a full-on mad max magic school bus adventure.

here's where the fuckup started. one night, i was sitting on my bed, tinkering with various supplies, when it finally hit me: the secret is not the launcher, but the ammo. spitballs were too light, hornets were too restricting, and erasers were inaccurate. i needed something aerodynamic. so, my sociopath eleven-year-old brain decided that the inkwell of a pen would do nicely. ""i'll cover the tip with an eraser, what could go wrong?"" i thought to myself.

let me tell you.

the next day, i created the ultimate cannon, utilizing no less than seven rubber bands, a pen barrel, two springs, and a binder clip for a trigger. with the inkwell loaded, i felt like a small, sexually frustrated macgyver with intent to kill. on the bus, my friend (let's call him neo) was extremely interested in my device, and asked for a demonstration. i obliged, and fit the eraser to the end of the ammo. neo opened the bus window, and told me to aim outside the window and hit the school wall (we were still parked at the school at this time). i aimed, pulled back and fired. all i saw was the eraser flying off the inkwell before i heard an extremely sudden *crack*. i looked forward, and there was a hole in the double-pane window of the bus, only an inch or two from neo's head.

my parents had to pay for the window. neo's parents didn't let me over to his house until senior year. the principal cracked down on locker artillery and suspended anyone (including myself for three days) who dare use a pen for anything other than writing. 

but i still won that arms race.

tl;dr: sixth grade was obsessed with launching spitballs and erasers at each other. i upgraded the ammo and nearly killed my friend and broke a window with a pen inkwell. i was suspended and my friend's parents don't like me anymore.

edit: rip inbox. thank you for the gold, kind stranger!
