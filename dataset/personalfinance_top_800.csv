"warning: at&t applying ""customer loyalty speed upgrades"" without customer consent. so over the holiday i received an email with an order confirmation from at&t (my isp, and the only one available in my area) and it had a new bill amount (about $5/month higher).

i haven't ordered anything so the first thing i thought was maybe someone got a hold of my account number or personal info and changed it. i immediately logged in to check out my plan and make sure everything was in order. i had a notification that showed that at&t had ""upgraded my internet speed at no extra charge""(https://imgur.com/lruuetx)

obviously i was annoyed by this, so i dug a little deeper to figure out why the bill had changed. i then found this alert showing that the ""promotional discount"" for this so-called ""customer loyalty speed upgrade""(https://imgur.com/ptyazt6) would expire in a month and my bill would go up $20 more per month. 

i then looked at my bill and found that they had upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent(https://imgur.com/thjwb7j), under the guise of ""customer loyalty"", and applied a $20/month promotional rate for 1 month to make it look like my plan hadn't changed and the new bill was probably just some random $5 fee added on like most isps occasionally do. 

i immediately called and spoke to a rep named jorge who stated that it was a mistake, that the change was applied automatically and it wasn't supposed to be applied to my account, but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people, he confessed that at&t was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it. i don't for one second believe this was accidental. i believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people won't notice.

make sure you watch your bills, because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others. i'm not sure what should be done about it (if anything) and i don't personally care at this point because the issue is resolved for me, but i do feel like at&t should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible, so i wanted to post to show everyone what happened. if this is the wrong place to post, please suggest a better sub. this was just the closest thing i could think of that applied and it could be shared/crossposted from here.

**edit:** since there were a couple questions about my last login, the 2015 date is inaccurate. i usually log in from my phone but did it via my computer this time so i could make the post easier w/ images etc. not sure why it's showing 2015 as my last login as i'm pretty sure i didn't even have at&t then lol ... anyway, here's the email i received, dated 12/30/17, so this is definitely a current thing(https://i.imgur.com/i7w1vpu.png)

**edit 2:** since this is getting a good amount of attention, if this happens to you here's what i did: you should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesn't get paid (note that i got this email 12/30/17, two days before the bill was due on 1/1/18, so they definitely tried to sneak it by me). then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate, you should pay that month's bill manually, then let autopay resume. as others have noted in the comments always watch your bill closely!

**edit 3:** fixed some formatting stuff

**edit 4:** holy moly this thread has picked up some steam! thanks anonymous reddit friend for popping my golden cherry!

**one last edit:** from a pm i received...the sender wanted to remain anonymous but i thought this was great info: 

>i work in big telcom. what you experienced is called a ""slam sale"" in the industry. it's when a salesman places an order for you, without ever receiving your approval for the order. the salesman gets credit for the sale, meets quota or receives a big bonus. 

>oddly enough, this is not a very common tactic today. it was popular until 10 years ago, and it's almost unheard of today. i wasn't aware that at&t was experiencing slam sales today. 

>you can protect your account from slam sales. all the major telco providers will offer authentication-secure account protection. call at&t, ask for billing, and tell the rep that you want to password-protect your account from unauthorized sales. you can setup either a password or a pin that must be entered to make any account changes. 

>sorry this happened to you.

and another pm:

>i also work for a major telco as well(name is somewhat synonymous with dicks), the account pin/password is visible to us when we do verification and would not stop someone from putting sales on random accounts. pretty much every isp and cable company uses outdated billing software from the 80's that's a glorified as400 mainframe running with a 90's era gui overlay. scroll about halfway down in this(http://www.makotek.net/intranet/forms/icoms%20technician%20guide.pdf) pdf for some screenshots.

all of these companies are regulated — a government agency is paid by your taxes to make sure you're not ripped off. these companies also rip you off in small amounts in part because they assume you won't do anything about it. when you complain about it to the government agency that regulates them, they not only fix your problem but if enough people complain, they'll fix the whole system, which helps other people.

the types of problems could be billing (they overcharge you), service (you're not getting what you're paying for), unfair and deceptive practices (you were tricked) or more. all of these complaint systems work in 2 weeks or less and it's awesome. it's sort of crazy more people don't know about them.

"u.s. breaks up fake i.r.s. phone scam operation -- 21 people sentenced for up to 20 yrs, 32 in india indicted. some good news(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/business/irs-phone-scams-jeff-sessions.html) for those who have experienced this scam or know people who have been duped by the same: 

>with stiff sentences for 21 conspirators last week in the united states and a round of indictments in india, the justice department says it has broken up what appeared to be the nation's first large-scale, multinational telephone fraud operation.

>over four years, more than 15,000 victims in the united states lost ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars to the sophisticated scam, and more than 50,000 individuals had their personal information misused, the department said friday. the money was routed through call centers in india back to the ringleaders in eight states.

>the fraudulent calls came suddenly and frequently while the scam was active from 2012 to 2016, according to court documents. a person posing as an internal revenue service or immigration official was on the phone, threatening arrest, deportation or other penalties if the victims did not immediately pay their debts with prepaid cards or wire transfers.

>in an announcement on friday, the department said 21 people living in eight states — illinois, arizona, florida, california, alabama, new jersey and texas — were sentenced last week in houston to prison for up to 20 years for their role in the scheme.

>in addition, 32 contractors in india involving five call centers in ahmedabad, a city in western india, have been indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation, the department said.

as always, remain vigilant about supposed irs claims, and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the irs. the irs never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards), or threatens to bring in the police, immigration officers or other law-enforcement. communication always begins over snail mail. hopefully these arrests will serve as a warning to others trying to prey on vulnerable populations.

"i made a spreadsheet for people who don't know how to budget!. hey guys! last year i made a spreadsheet to help myself budget- i'm terrible at sticking to a budget so i made a sheet that breaks it down so that i just have the ability to break it down to a daily manageable amount.

heres what it looks like(https://imgur.com/a/ojaju7a)

i grew up very poor and had no sense of what or even how to start budgeting. i was taught that money would disappear if i didn't use it, so i just used it. even now i still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if i'm not careful. another problem i faced is that i have adhd, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. this spreadsheet is made so you only focus on one number.

&#x200b;

the sheet was set up with three goals in mind:

&#x200b;

1. that it be easy to use
2. that it focuses on a daily budget that supports long term goals- instead of a long term budget that doesn't have daily support
3. that it be a good starting place for people who have never saved before

&#x200b;

so how does it work?

the main budget is divided into three core areas:

&#x200b;

* income: you use this to fill in your income and choose to have a monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly pay cycle. if you are a worker who is tipped it includes an area where you can add tips, my suggestion is put in your minimum average income from tips- so for example, if you usually make 100 from tips a week, even if you get extra, try to program your budget around the 100 minimum average.
* expenses:  there you can add your expenses. utilities are bills that are for electricity, heat, phone, internet, or water. bills are important expenses that you can't miss and are integral to living. finally, expenses are other things you need to allocate money for- whether it be gas, lunch expenses, transportation- ect. within your expenses there are two areas to which you need to pay attention:-credit card payments: this is new to this year's sheet, use the tab below to fill out your information for up to three credit cards. decide whether to pay the minimum payment or choose an amount to pay. the tab will allow you to see how much you're paying and how much interest you're accruing.  once you have filled it out, your budget will adjust accordingly.-big purchase: use this tab to create a budget for a large purchase, and adjust your budget easily and automatically to finance this purchase!
* budget summary:  finally the most important part of this sheet is the budget summary- here you will see just how much you can spend. this money is shown in three ways, the lump monthly sum, a weekly amount, or a daily amount. as long as you don't go over that number, you will have enough money for the rest of your budget. it will also feature a breakdown of what your budget it, where your money is going, and what your income vs spending is!

&#x200b;

~~here is a link to the sheet~~(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ycjtrgvkum7sixilsaqnlhxwemh-qgbeulzbm5bedmg/copy)

&#x200b;

ou use it like this

* go in
* make a copy
* change the numbers
* decide what percentage of your income you want to be saved
* budget.

the sheet includes three charts:

* a bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving
* a pie chart to see where your money is distributed
* a daily pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings

i don't work well with a lot of budgets because i have issues imagining the big picture. by giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget i can make sure that on any given day i haven't spent more than i'm allowed to- and if i do i can see where i'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

"stop spending money on food! -- buy a crockpot. **holy shit at the money people spend on food!**

and i was the exact same way when i landed my first job out of college.  you know what i'm talking about--biscuit and starbucks on the way to work, lunch out with coworkers and pizza and beer at the local tavern for dinner!  every night!  all week!  professional money spender!  and more beers and dinners on the weekends!  woohoo!

wait.  where did all my money go?  and how the hell did i gain 40 pounds in six months?  if you're nodding your head you've fallen into the brand-new-job-big-salary-eat-out-because-i-can trap.  and you have to stop it.  it's killing your bank account, it's killing your financial freedom and it's killing *you*. (literally--i was on the edge of type 2 diabetes and had hyperglycemia during routine physicals.)

**what you know you need to do: *stop eating out***

but how??? how do i stop eating out???  fast food is *soooo* good!  and cooking is *soooo* hard!  well, first off, not really--you're just attuned to that garbage 'food'.  you're going to break free of both these stereotypes and someone has already invented it.....

>crockpot.  it's the crockpot.  crockpot.  crockpot.  maybe you call it a slow cooker, but i'm from georgia and here it's a crockpot.  

***!stop!***--if you do not own a crockpot i highly recommend you go buy one from amazon and buy the biggest one you can afford!

get one with a timer that switches to warm after the cook settings: *just google it cause mods dont like links!*

**boom!**  $39 investment.  we're going to make that back in.... *three days*.  are you ready?  we're going to make enough food for dinner *and* left overs for lunch.

i'm going to give you some of my super-secret-i-eat-this-every-week-crockpot-meals that are delicious, cheap, filling and easy.  yes.  the crockpot makes *all* of those possible.

**meal 1: thick cut porkchop with potatoes and carrots**

>servings: 4

>ingredients:

>1 can beef broth (50 cents)

>spray or wipe crockpot with cooking oil.  add beef broth, gravy mix and onion soup mix and stir.  place porkchops in broth.  chop carrots and potatoes and add to top of porkchops.  that's it.

>prepare this before you go to bed for the next day!  put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  cook on low for 8 hours.  when you get home make your salad and dig in.  use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**meal 2: sausage, potato and kale soup**
>servings: 4

>total cost: about $14/4 = 3.50 a serving

>brown italian sausage with chopped garlic and chopped onion.  while meat is browning add to crockpot the 3/4 cup of heavy cream, chicken stock, and chopped yukon potatoes.  add browned sausage and top with half the bag of kale.  (i get two recipes per bag of kale).

>prepare this before you go to bed for the next day!  put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  cook on low for 8 hours.  when you get home dig in! use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**meal 3: super awesome easy chili**
>servings: a lot (6-8?) -- i eat this *all* the time and it's delicious.  stores really well in the refrigerator (and chili gets better over time!)

>edit: the spice proportions are correct!  this makes nearly two gallons of good (about 7l).

>edit: salt to taste($1)

>total cost = $20/8 = about $2.50 per serving

>drain the tomatoes and kidney beans but don't drain the black or chili beans.  brown the ground beef.  add everything to the crockpot and stir like crazy.... and that's it!

>prepare this before you go to bed for the next day!  put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  cook on low for 8 hours.  when you get home dig in! use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.


it's easy guys.  it's really easy.  you spend 15 minutes a night and you make *tons* of food for lunch and dinner and you save a lot of money!  and its good for you! (better than wendy's--that's for sure!)  and its easy!

**stop spending your money on eating out and go full crockpot!  i am much happier and much wealthier!**

edit: for our vegetarian friends.  you can't get any more simple than this!

**meal 4: baked potato**
>servings: as many potatoes as you bake

>1 potato

>cover in tin foil and place directly in crockpot.  cook on low 4-6 hours or keep on warm all day.


**meal 5: vegetable soup**
>servings: however much you want to make

>tomatoes, potatoes, green beans, zucchini, carrots, peas, or onions

>vegetable stock

>onion powder, garlic powder, salt and black pepper

>add vegetables in any proportion you desire to crockpot and add vegetable stock until covered.  season to taste.  cook on low until vegetables are tender.

edit 2: i live in georgia and shop at kroger--prices may vary.  if you live in canadia or buy organic free range vegetables harvested by hipsters with a minimum of a master's degree you will obviously pay more.

edit 3: ""just learn to cook!""--yeah, okay guys.  i agree.  i cook more than just in a crockpot.  this post was inspired after i read a /r/personalfinance about a single guy who spends $1300 a month on food because ""he didn't have enough time to cook with work"".  i wrote a very long comment and just made it into a post.  the point was you can eat decent food in a short amount of time and save money by planning one day ahead.  

edit 4: i agree fresh vegetables are better and these aren't the *healthiest* recipes.  this post was just to encourage those that eat all the time to transition to something healthier... and then they can transition to something even healthier... and on and on until they've become a raw vegan, growing their own vegetables, saving the whales and composting regularly.

edit 5: electricity costs: crockpots seem to consume between 200w and 700w per hour.  that's between 2 and 6 kwhs for 8 hours of cooking.  that's about 15 to 60 cents.  it seems insignificant relative to the overall cost of food.

edit 6: i'm not a shill or marketing person for crockpot.  i'm a mechanical engineer.  don't believe me?  my first post on reddit ever was about bolt failures:  https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3e20vs/bolt_failure_modes/ctatj1y/

take off your tin foil hat..... and use it to wrap a baked potato to put in your *new crockpot!!!*",10
"quick reminder to not give away your salary requirement in a job interview. i know i've read this here before but had a real-life experience with it yesterday that i thought i'd share. 

going into the interview i was hoping/expecting that the range for the salary would be similar to where i am now. when the company recruiter asked me what my target salary was, i responded by asking, ""what is the range for the position?"" to which they responded with their target, which was $30k more than i was expecting/am making now. essentially, if i would have given the range i was hoping for (even if it was +$10k more than i am making it now) i still would have sold myself short.

"irs will allow employers to match their employees' student loan repayments. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/irs-ruling-allows-401k-student-loan-benefits-2018-08-27

the irs is setting up a framework for companies to match their employees' student loan repayments in the same way companies match 401k contributions. this will be cost neutral for the employer (edit: as in, it would not be more or less expensive for the company than traditional matching).

edit: the employer's match would go into the employee's 401k account.

according to the article, employees with student loan debt accumulate 50% less wealth in their retirement plans (by age 30) than their peers without student loan debt. i think most of us with student debt have at one point or another felt ""behind"".

thoughts? this is definitely a cool idea and would be a great hiring incentive/perk.

edit 2: due to the popularity of this post, i wanted to remind everyone of some of the rules on our sub.

>we don't allow:
 • moralizing issues
 • petitions
 • political discussions
 • political baiting
 • soapboxing

this is meant to be a discussion of personal finance, debt, and retirement savings, not a meta review of the pros and cons of capitalism. please keep things on topic.


edit 3: since a lot of people are confused, i'll explain how a 401k match works. a 401k is a retirement savings plan that came into popularity as pensions fell out of the mainstream. the 401k is a tax-efficient vehicle to invest your money for retirement. like the pension, employers can contribite to their employees' 401k plans as a benefit. this is usually done via a matching mechanism: i contribute 4% of my paycheck, and my employer matches that amount. matches are almost always capped.

with the method laid out in the article, you would be able to make qualified student loan payments and have your company match that amount as a contribution to your 401k, up to a certain amount. so say you make $2000 per month, your employer matches 5% of your 401k contributions, and your monthly minimum loan payment is $1000 (in this example, you have a lot of debt). you aren't contributing to your 401k currently. if your company chose to take advantage of this program, they would put $100 ($2000*0.05 match) in your 401k each month you made a payment on your student loan.

this doesn't ""hurt"" people without loans. this is only subsidized by the government insofaras the 401k is tax-sheltered (you still pay taxes on that money), and this doesn't constitute your company paying your loans. participation isn't compulsory.",10

companies need to get back to rewarding employees for their tenure. until they do, don't reward companies with your loyalty. when you're worth more on the open market than your company will give you, they are doing you a disservice and you should make the best decision for your own future and go make what you're worth. the more people who do this, the more likely companies will be to change and allow us to stick around and be compensated for it.

"i mde a spreadsheet for people who dont know how to budget! ver. 2.0. hey guys! i'm back six months later with a new version of the budgeting spreadsheet i made. earlier this year i posted the spreadsheet i made for myself and it really resonated with people. as i got more and more feedback i found places where i could improve and develop the sheet into something easier to use but still useful. 

you can find pictures of it here(https://imgur.com/a/63lxvuq)

a bit of background on me and why i made this- and also why it's made the way it is. i grew up poor and was never taught about how to handle money. if we had money it was already needed for other things. food, bills, all of the money we had already had a place. this made me get a mentality that if i had money i needed to spend it before something came up and the money would go. it's unhealthy, but it was the only thing i knew until i moved out. i was taught that money would disappear if i didn't use it, so i just used it. even now i still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if i'm not careful. 

&#x200b;

another problem i faced is that i have adhd, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. this spreadsheet is made so you only focus on one number. 

&#x200b;

i have made this sheet- and previous versions of it- with three goals in mind:

* that it be easy to use
* that i can focus on one daily number while supporting my long term goals
* that it be a good starting place for people who have never had another budget

the sheet is divided into a few different tools.

budget:

* select your pay schedule, add any extra income/tips that you get monthly and select the percentage of that income that you want to save.
* the credit card section allows you to input up to five cards and adds your monthly car payments to your expenses
* the expenses area is where you'll add all of your itemized expenses. you can also select when your bill is due during the month- allowing you to see if early on in the month your spendable is different from later on in the month. 

your budget summary at the top is the breakdown of all the information below. yes i know pie charts aren't useful for everything- but that is useful to visually digest information. look and see where your money is going, see if you spend more than you earn, and finally- see how much money you can spend.

&#x200b;

this sheet focuses on giving you one number to remember. daily spendable. if you want to spend money throughout the day you just have to make sure you dont go over that number and you will always have enough to cover any other expenses. 

 i don't work well with a lot of budgets because i have issues imagining the big picture. by giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget i can make sure that on any given day i haven't spent more than i'm allowed to- and if i do i can see where i'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

there are a few extra features too- a large purchase calculator that lets you figure how long youd have to save to buy a larger purchase. it includes a monthly tracker that lets you see what youre spending realistically vs what you've budgeted for and finally a daily tracker for further breakdown.

"last month, i spent $770 eating out. this month, i've spent $42. this is only the first of many financial self control habits i'm trying to get myself into!. in my credit card's april-may billing cycle, i spent **$770** eating out as *one person.* i decided to track my spending in this area by putting all my meals i've been eating out on a credit card used only for that purpose. i looked at the end of the month and was absolutely dumbfounded at the amount of money i was spending eating out. i thought it might be $300ish dollars! 

anyway, i paid off the credit card (angrily) and made a vow i would eat at home at every possible meal i could for the foreseeable future. i've spent about $70 a week on groceries, (was about $50/week prior) so plus $42, i went from and $1000/mo food expense (how the ever living hell was i making ends meet with this?) to $322/mo. and the kicker is i still have tons of food leftover at the end of the week. the only two meals i bought this month were a bk chicken sandwich while i was on the road and a birthday meal for someone. 

it feels awesome to have a 70% reduction in spending in this area just due to self control. 

i'm planning on using this self control in other areas. next one is booze and cigarettes. then my shitty habit of mobile game micro transactions. 

sometimes i don't know how i've made it this far without being broke.",10
"be careful what you say in public. my wife and i were at panera eating breakfast and we noticed a lady be hind us talking on the phone very loudly. we couldn't help over hearing  her talk about a bill not being paid. we were a little annoyed but not a big deal because it was a public restaurant. we were not trying to listen but were shocked when she announced that she was about to read her card number. she then gave the card's expiration date, security code, and her zip code. we clearly heard and if we were planning on stealing it she gave us plenty of notice to get a pen.

don't read your personal information in public like this. you never know who is listening and who is writing stuff down.",10
"when heading into black friday sales, it's not a sale if you didn't plan to buy the item in the first place.. many people i see go into a store to buy one or two things, and come out with way more than they anticipated, with the excuse ""oh i saved money! it was all on sale!"". 

if you we're going to get the item anyway, yes you saved money, but if you didn't plan on it, you still spent money you didn't have to.

edit: you could also set a budget, $150 for example. if you're going into a store, don't bring your card, only bring cash so you're not tempted to go over your limit. (edit of an edit: someone mentioned you could miss out on some rewards or promotions if you don't have your card, so i wonder what another way to limit yourself other than willpower would be?)

edit 2: thank you all so much for the support on this post, i tried replying to the comments at the start but it became overwhelming with the amount of comments coming in, thank you all for your input and advice to others!

"transunion burying their credit freeze to sell their own credit monitoring product trueidentity. i'm not sure where to post this, but noticed something had changed on the transunion website about freezing credit this morning when i was giving links to family so they could freeze theirs. 

i froze my credit the day after news about the equifax breach broke, and it looks like transunion has since changed their site to push people away from freezing their credit in favor for their own product called trueidentity (like what equifax was doing with their trustedid premier.)


the ftc website links to this page(http://www.transunion.com/freeze) for freezing your credit with transunion.


this is what the website looked before the changes were made on 9/11.(https://web.archive.org/web/20170729070041/https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze) the instructions on placing a credit freeze were clear and there was no mention of their own trueidentity product.


if you want to place a credit freeze with transunion now:

* you have to get through a page of info about credit and fraud, and then the action it tells you to take is to ""lock your credit information by enrolling in trueidentity.""
* the option to freeze your credit is under ""about credit freeze"", deliberately passive in their use of language
* the description about credit freezing is dissuasive: ""a credit freeze may be available under your state law""
* the link for the credit freeze is also a passive ""click here"" compared with ""by enrolling in trueidentity"" language used for the link to their own product.
* clicking the link to learn more about credit freeze brings you to yet another page(https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze2) that tries to convince you to enroll in their product over placing a credit freeze
* after searching through their page of bs, you finally get to the link to freeze your credit(https://freeze.transunion.com).


this is such a blatant attempt by transunion to take advantage of the equifax breach for their own financial gain. it's a shitty thing for transunion to do, and people should be aware that they are being led away from putting an actual credit freeze on their account.

"warren buffet just won his ten-year bet about index funds outperforming hedge funds. https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/how-warren-buffett-won-his-multi-million-dollar-long-bet-3af05cf4a42d

""over the years, i've often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering i've learned a good deal about human behavior. my regular recommendation has been a low-cost s&p 500 index fund. to their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.

i believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when i've given it to them. instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.""

...

""over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. protege funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. buffett had made his point. when looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. and when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.""",10
"girlfriend applied for a job, within 24 hours they hired her, and sent her a check for $4,000 to buy supplies. scam?. i dont know if this is the right place to post this.

my girlfriend applied to a job at a place called hci group. within one conversation online they hired her, and said they will send her a check for $4,000 to buy necessary equipment like software. 

this morning, she received an overnight check from patelco credit union for $4,415.

my dad used to tell me ""if it seems too good to be true, it is"". and this seems like one of those things. does anyone have any info on hci group, patelco credit union, company scams where they send you a cashiers and rush you? 

**edit** email she just received:

you're to deposit the check to your account and scan and email the atm deposit slip to me on ( redacted ) once done for confirmation, no need to send the slip to any other email address or email any worker that you got the package even if a note came with the check, have already contacted them they just want to make sure you get it, so you email the slip to my email address only, thanks
note: make sure it's an atm deposit because atm is 24 hours service and funds availability, you need to order the equipment tomorrow once the full funds are available so that you can receive the equipment by next tomorrow and get started.

you only need to take your atm card with the check to your bank's atm machine then deposit it into your bank account okay ? you will see the option when you get to the atm

**edit 2** just talked to patelco. a check for $4,415 was never issued from their company. sending patelco a picture of the check since they said its a fraud, and then shredding that son of a b. i've read all your comments by the way! we're just figuring out how to respond to a very needy spammer.

**edit 3** scammers are angry at our non-responsiveness. they threatened us by saying ""you better cash in that check or their agents will find you"". i promptly told them to fuck off and blocked them. patelco was very happy we called them, since now they know their company is being used for scams.

**edit 4** just wanted to do another quick edit. my girlfriend received this job offer from her schools job network. she goes to a small, expensive private college and she got hit with this fraud through a secure network that needs to be approved by the school first. always be on the lookout for scam. 

**edit 5** we did not shred the check. we decided against it and are going to report it. 

**edit 6** blowing up much further than i expected this too. /u/iac74205 said i could report it to the postal inspectors if it came by usps. it came by fedex, is there a postal inspector for that?

**edit 7** we've contacted the school once to report the scam! my girlfriend is taking a shower and right afterwards shes a: reporting it to the fbi and b: demanding that the school sends out an email blast to all of the students going there. 

**edit 8** i said it in a comment below, but i just wanted to thank all of you for all of your advice. i've read every comment and we have a ton on our plate to take care of. the users of /r/personalfinance rock!

**edit 9** reported it to the school, this was their message: 

hi girlfriend,

thank you for sending over this information.  we have flagged this employer in handshake as fraudulent and have removed them as an approved employer as well.  i know that redacted, our office manager, has already created a warning in the system for them, and i will do the same with the information you have sent to me.  i will also discuss with our directors about any further steps that need to be taken.

thank you so much for reporting this!  please let me know if you have any other concerns.

**edit 10** using edits to answer faq's now. she did not give any information besides what would be on a resume. work history, name, etc. she did not give bank account details or her ss number.

**edit 11** just in case someone wanted to see what the fake check and the letter she was send looks like, here you go(http://imgur.com/a/lfw0m)

**edit 12** i just wanted to confirm this, both patelco and hci are legitimet companies. we called patelco and they have their fraud working on it. we didn't call hci but i've had enough messages saying they've worked from hci i believe its legit. i think this guy was just using the names to sound legit.

**edit 13** ladies and gentlemen, i need to give a shout out to /u/dotonfire /u/kell_naranek and /u/meanreds . they pointed out that the signature is thomas jeffersons. the dead are rising, and they're scamming /s

**gilded edit 14** i was just given gold. as much as i appreciate someone thinking a thread for asking advice is good enough to pay real money too, its unneccessary! if you are really feeling charitable, consider giving to a charity. personally, i suggest doctors without borders(https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/onetime.cfm?source=add1600u0v53&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_expid=7773760-9.t4pemk1ytfeoymrjr_ytiq.0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.com%2f) or pacer(https://pacer.ejoinme.org/mypages/donatetothenationalbullyingpreventioncenter/tabid/229451/default.aspx) . use it for something more important than bragging rights.

**final edit 15** final edit unless there's anything super important that happens. everythings been reported to the proper agencies, like the fbi. hopefully we find this guy or get a response.

nothing on our end was lost and we took all security percautions so we're safe. thank you everyone for the advice and help! 

**final edit 15.2** for some reason i can't see this post on reddit anymore besides direct link? anyways, school sent out an email blast for other students safety. **make sure to report fraud to people who can help prevent it(http://imgur.com/gallery/ms8n0)**

**final edit 15.3** i told my dad this got tons of upvotes. he replied with ""awesome"". finally my dad is proud",10
"this is just a reminder that bank of america charges $144 a year to have a basic checking account, and will change your account type over automatically after you graduate, or charge you when you're looking for a job. so if you're recently graduated, unemployed, or have another life event don't be surprised to see a $12 a month ""account maintenance fee"" if your account has a penny under $1500 at any time throughout the month.

edit: congratulations to all the students graduating this month and the next. i know bank fees are the last thing you want to be concerned about while graduating and looking for a job, but it's always important to stay on top of your personal finance and i hope this reminder has been helpful. i know many of you signed up for the account when you were sixteen. i'm glad that this made the front page of reddit and i thank the mods for stickying this for this month. if just one person saves some money from this reminder, i'll be happy.

edit 2: if you have a direct deposit of $250+ every month from your job you will also dodge this fee. this post was targeted at the soon to be unemployed so that probably isn't relevant to you however. the comments are full of alternative banks and credit unions with no such fee if you're interested in switching, and this comment covers how many of the former loopholes people used to avoid this fee have been closed.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6c35ne/this_is_just_a_reminder_that_bank_of_america/dhs1b3j/) i also saw a comment that there was a class action lawsuit when a certain amount type had this happen to them, so if you've never seen this fee you may have been grandfathered in under that account type.",10
"if you can't get your emergency fund to grow because of emergencies that keep coming up, you're still doing a good job.. over the summer i made a steadfast commitment to getting my 3 month emergency fund built, which is only about 15k. i'm saving $750 a month, which is exactly 15% of my family's post-tax income. in the 3 months since i made that change, i've had $1.8k in car repairs, $600 in vet bills, and $250 to cover a friend who got towed from our guest parking (our fault). needless to say, the needle hasn't moved as i wanted it to, and i have to keep reassuring myself that, had i not made this commitment, i'd be in real trouble covering these costs. the end goal will come eventually. 

edit: just to clarify - this is a two person budget!",10
"please, for the sake of your wallet, meal prep.. i'm slowly but surely crawling my way out of that lovely college student debt i incurred over four years and gaining financial independence. i've found out how insanely important meal prepping can be. 

every sunday, for about 2 hours, i cook and cook and cook. i make sure i make enough for my fiance and i to have lunches for the entire week. that's all it takes, two hours!  and like $40 in groceries. when i was really struggling for money, i would still find myself going out to lunch every single day and spending $10-$15 a meal. that's $50-$75 a week!  now i cook for two people for less than that. 

just a little advice and personal success here - meal prep your heart out and your wallet will thank you. 

edit: wow!  did not know how popular this would get. i can't keep up with replying to posts so i'll address two common comments here. 

1 - a lot of people keep bringing up the point that the ""cost"" of my time is not worth the meal prep and i beg to differ. these two hours i use are two hours that i would just be playing overwatch or something like that. and the money i'm saving can work for me in paying off debts and investing, so personally it's my best option.  i realize this doesn't work for everyone. i also can't take the easy way out with $5 boxes at taco bell or something similar as my body doesn't tolerate gluten which cuts out most fast food options. 

2 - every week i go to aldi and stock up on brown rice, black beans, corn, ground turkey or tofu, a bag of chicken and some veggies. most common meal prepped is burrito bowls. which is 1 pound of ground turkey, 2 cans of beans, 1 can corn, 1 jar of salsa, and brown rice mixed with cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and coriander. makes 12 cups of food at 1,220 calories total. i divide this up into six 2 cup containers. then usually make chicken with veggies or gluten free pasta for the remaining two days of meals for us. utilizing four burners, a stove, and a microwave all at once produces a surprising amount of food very quickly. i store it all in tupperware for the week and it stays well. some people recommend prepping and freezing as well. are there some days where i dread eating the same meal and eat out?  heck yes, but it's not every day like it used to be. and my wallet and waistline has rewarded me greatly for that.

"to all the graduating high school seniors and those turning 18 - get a bank account that's only in your name.. for minors, it's generally required for a parent to co-sign their bank accounts.  once you turn 18, it's best to establish an account in your name only, so you have sole control of it.  it would even be better if you can establish the account at a different bank/credit union than the one the minor account was in, to avoid any inadvertent connections between the previous and new account.

there are a couple reasons for this.  it doesn't take too long to find stories of people who are still using the accounts they had when they were minors who are shocked when their money is suddenly taken away for reasons beyond their control.  the parents could have financial problems and either use the money to pay off their debts or the money is seized by the institutions that they owe.  there could be disagreements between parents and their kids, so they take the money away as a punishment.  or, it could just be old fashioned greed and the parents decide to just take the money.  it doesn't matter who earned the money that's in the account.  if two people are on it, the money belongs to both parties and the bank isn't going to stop someone on the account from withdrawing the cash.

keep in mind also, having your own account does not mean that your parents can't send you money if you need it.  all they need is your account and routing number (the same information that would be on a check) to deposit money into the account.  in addition, there are any number of banking apps today they could use to send money to you if you're still being supported by them.  other excuses may have good intentions at heart, but from a safety and security standpoint, it's best to establish an independent banking account.",10
"if you start suddenly getting email/spam ""bombed"" there's probably a reason. i'm not 100% sure how well this fits here (it is financial), but i wanted to warn as many people as possible.

last week on tuesday morning i was sitting at my desk and suddenly started getting emails. lots, and lots, and lots of them. 30-40 every minute. they were clearly spam. many of them had russian or chinese words, but random.

i called one of our it guys and he confirmed it was just me. and the traffic was putting a strain on our mail server so they disabled my account. by that point i have over 700 emails in my inbox. they were bypassing the spam filter (more on that later). after a different situation that happened  a few months ago, i've learned that things like this aren't random.

so i googled ""suddenly getting lots of spam"". turns out, scammers do this to bury legitimate emails from you, most often to hide purchases. i started going through the 700+ emails one by one until i found an email from amazon.com(https://amazon.com) confirming my purchase of 5 pc graphics cards (over $1000).

i logged into my amazon account, but didn't see an order. then i checked - sure enough those cheeky bastards had archived the order too. i immediately changed my password and called amazon..

i still haven't heard from their security team how the breach happened (if they got into my amazon account by password, or did a ""one time login"" through my email.) the spam made it through our spam filter because the way this spam bomb was conducted, they use bots to go out to ""legitimate"" websites and sign your email up for subscription etc. so then i'd get an email from a random russian travel site, and our filters let it through.

either way - we got the order cancelled before it shipped, and my email is back to normal - albeit different passwords.

and i honestly thought about shipping a box of dog crap to that address (probably a vacant house) but i decided against mailing bio-hazardous waste.

either way - if you see something suspicious - investigate!

edit: thanks for all the great input everyone. just finished putting 2fa on every account that allows it. hopefully keep this from happening again!",10
"your parents took decades to furnish their house. if you're just starting out, remember that it took your parents decades to collect all the furniture, decorations, appliances, etc you are used to having around.  it's easy to forget this because you started remembering things a long while after they started out together, so it feels like that's how a house should always be. 

it's impossible for most people starting out to get to that level of settled in without burying themselves in debt.  so relax, take your time, and embrace the emptiness!  you'll enjoy the house much more if you're not worried about how to pay for everything all the time.

"heads up: the federal government just filed suit against navient, claiming they scammed millions of borrowers between 2010-2015 to the tune of $4 billion. this is huge.. the suit was filed january 18th 2017, by the consumer finance protection bureau (cfpb) against navient. 

first, know that the cfpb has requested that the court order navient to comply with the following actions, among others: 

1. restitution to consumers harmed by navient's conduct; 

2. disgorgement of all ill-gotten revenue


here are the details of the allegations: 

from consumer affairs .com(https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/feds-sue-student-loan-servicer-navient-011817.html): 
>specifically, the suit charges that navient:
>> fails to correctly apply or allocate borrower payments to their accounts;

>> steers struggling borrowers toward paying more than they have to on loans;

>> obscured information consumers needed to maintain their lower payments;

>> deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; and

>> harmed the credit of disabled borrowers, including severely injured veterans.

from the la times(http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-navient-lawsuit-20170118-story.html): 
>in its lawsuit, the consumer agency alleged many other borrowers had problems enrolling in programs to reduce payments and navient instead steered struggling borrowers into plans that made more money for navient but saddled borrowers with higher costs.

>specifically, the government alleged that navient maintained compensation policies that encouraged customer service representatives to push borrowers into forbearance, which allows borrowers to suspend payments without defaulting but does not stop interest from accruing.

>however, most federal student-loan borrowers earned the right in 2009 to enroll in the less costly payment options that are based on their income.

>although those plans save borrowers money, forbearance was more lucrative for navient, the agency alleged because the company could enroll borrowers in forbearance in less time and with less staff.

>in all, the servicer slapped borrowers with additional interest charges of up to $4 billion by enrolling them in repeated forbearance plans from january 2010 to march 2015, according to the consumer agency. 

if you want to learn more about this, i highly encourage you to read the original complaint filed with the court by the cfpb. it is very readable (not filled with legalese) and reads as an absolutely scathing indictment of a company whose business practices targeted its most vulnerable customers in flagrant violation of the law. 

you can find the original complaint on the consumer finance .gov website(http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201701_cfpb_navient-pioneer-credit-recovery-complaint.pdf). they also summarized the complaint on their website(http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-nations-largest-student-loan-company-navient-failing-borrowers-every-stage-repayment/). 

in the spirit of this sub, i'm sharing this information because there are plenty of people here who may have been a victim of these alleged practices. including myself, as i've been paying down my navient loans since 2012 and have several years to go. 

i'm going to read through the complaint again, and if anything important jumps out at me that i haven't mentioned, i'll update this post. 

**edit:**
additional allegations: 

(since july 2011) disregard of borrower instructions when processing payments submitted by check with written instructions from the borrower specifying how the payment should be applied.

(jan 2010-march 2015) using uncharacteristically vague email titles like ""new document ready to view"" to notify borrowers that they needed to renew their income-based repayment enrollment. during this time, the number of borrowers who did not timely renew their enrollment regularly exceeded 60% of borrowers and resulting, often, in capitalization of interest. 

**edit:** there is no way to know how potentially impacted borrowers will be affected by the lawsuit. we will have to wait and see. lawsuits of this magnitude often take a long time to get resolved.

"my lyft/uber expenses were nearly $750 every month so i instead bought a bike for $900 and now my travel expenses are <$140. i used to lyft line or uber pool to work everyday or every other day so this was nearly ~$10 everyday so $200-250/month just for that. in addition i use uber/lyft to get around the city for meeting up with friends, getting groceries, going to meetups etc and that added up a lot. i was so shocked by this because even though the charges are tiny up front they really add up. 

so a few months ago i invested in a nice road bike for $900 and its been solid so far and my lyft usage dramatically went down. if i am going somewhere <2.5 miles i bike. i live in sf so hills can get pretty crazy so i also avoid areas that are further in the city. its even cheaper than public transport - which would cost me close to $100 every month to get to work. instead monthly bike maintenance is <$10 and i can use public transportation to go further into the city. i only use lyft/uber now if i am drunk or need to get to places that neither public transport or my bike can.

something i thought this sub might enjoy

**edit:** a lot of questions around why i used lyft/uber and taxi so much when sf is such a walkable city and it has great public transportation. 

no real reason besides i was stupid and incredibly lazy with terrible habits. i moved to sf fresh out of college a year ago and i work in tech so the salaries are pretty good. i wasn't disciplined about my finances for a while - as a matter of fact i wasn't until the last few months and then expenses racked up and i started building a credit balance. i used to use public transportation a lot and then i moved to a place where it was a little far so i got lazy and started taking lyft and this became such a habit that 4-5 months in i was taking it everywhere. 

i also used to call it all the time whenever friends/family was in town and never split. $750 does say a lot about me. bad habits are so easy to foster. but now i am more disciplined in this matter. i was careless. but i am self-aware enough to call myself out - only in this case i could've done it early; but that's alright because i did and made a lot of progress. 

so if you are 22 and are like me and have bad habits that alright. call yourself out. block a few hours on a weekend, and do nothing but understand your financial habits and make a budget to the last penny. it might anxiety at first but then you'll get a hold over it and it'll be alright.

**edit:** holy shit. this got way more attention than i wanted. a lot of good advice - thank you for that. thank you to all the people that were being nice. to the ones that reached out to me to be mean - try to be nice. 

i did invest in a good u lock and i also have a cable lock. when i'm at work i take it straight to my desk but when i go grocery shopping i usually lock it with the u-lock and also use the cable lock with the tires. it worked well so far. 

i also cook everyday so that ~$50 a week on groceries and i eat out about ~30 worth every weekend. so about ~$350 in eating a month. a lot of people reached out asking for advice - i will get back to you this weekend. ",10
"this article perfectly shows how uber and lyft are taking advantage of drivers that don't understand the real costs of the business.. i happened upon this article about a driver talking about how much he makes driving for uber and lyft: https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-driver-how-much-money-2019-10#when-it-was-all-said-and-done-i-ended-the-week-making-25734-in-a-little-less-than-14-hours-on-the-job-8

in short, he says he made $257 over 13.75 hours of work, for almost $19 an hour. he later mentions expenses (like gas) but as an afterthought, not including it in the hourly wage.

the federal mileage rate is $0.58 per mile. this represents the actual cost to you and your car per mile driven. the driver drove 291 miles for the work he mentioned, which translates into expenses of $169. 

this means his profit is only $88, for an hourly rate of $6.40. yet reading the article, it all sounds super positive and awesome and gives the impression that it's a great side-gig. no, all you're doing is turning vehicle depreciation into cash.",10

"my dad just figured out he's been paying $30/month for aol dial-up internet he hasn't used for at least the last ten years.. the bill was being autopaid on his credit card. i think he was aware he was paying it (i'm assuming), but not sure that he really knew why. or he forgot about it as i don't believe he receives physical bills in the mail and he autopays everything through his card.

he's actually super smart financially. budgets his money, is on track to retire next year (he's 56 now), uses a credit card for all his spending for points, and owns approximately 14 rental properties. 

i don't think he's used dial up for at least the last 10....15 years? anything he can do other than calling and cancelling now?

edit: aol refused to refund anything as i figured, and also tried to keep on selling their services by dropping the price when he said to cancel. 

i got a little clarification on the not checking his statement thing: he doesn't really check his statements. or i guess he does, but not in great detail. my dad logs literally everything in quicken, so when he pays his monthly credit card bill (to which he charges pretty much everything to) as long as the two (payment due and what he shows for expenses in quicken) are close he doesn't really think twice. he said they've always been pretty close when he compares the two so he didn't give it second thought.

"your amazon store card is probably scamming you. i noticed a weird charge in my statement that pays my amazon store credit card off. it's listed as security 5. i didn't know what it was but the amount kept going up as my card balance went up. 

called the number and the guy answered then danced around what the name of the company was and what they were charging me for.  eventually he slipped the word synchrony and that dinged in my head the bank that issues the amazon card. so i googled (all this while still trying to get this guy to tell me what this charge was for) and found that it's an automatic form of insurance that you are put on when you open the card. it's 1.66% of your balance monthly and you have to opt out by responding to a single piece of paper mail that gets sent sometime when you open the card. 

now im getting frustrated that this guy isn't saying what the hell his company does when he just changes gear and says the full balance will be returned and the service stopped. 

it was over 1800 dollars since 2014

i'll have it back in 3 days i was told but check your statements people. 

edit: even if you use the 0% for 12 months on large purchases (which is how i typically use my card) it still charges their fee every month

edit2: i had to go to amazons chat this morning as it was still showing as being active. the representative was polite and disabled it immediately, saying the refund will come in a 1-3 weeks credited to my card.

"got laid off and now the company that laid me off is trying to hire me back at a discount.. three months ago i was laid off as part of a 60 person lay off in a small company of 125 people.  i do occupational health and safety work as i was the manager.   i was given unemployment; been searching for jobs.

fast forward 3 months, tax bill passed, etc.  i get a phone call from the president of the company asking me to come in because he has an opportunity.  he tells me things are picking back up and the company needs me back but he's trying to shop me at a discounted rate.

i had been with the company 6 years and he says he wants to give me 20 hours at 60% of what i was making to do consulting work for 4 months until my lease is up.  this seems like a super low ball offer especially because they don't have to train anyone, i already know all of the employees, i am familiar with their policies as i wrote many of them.  also after 4 months i cant get back on unemployment and having taken such a drastic pay cut i wouldn't be very well equipped to ask for more money in the future.

i feel like this is a slap in the face and i want to counter offer their 60% slap with a 125% slap back.

does this seem unreasonable??  just seeking some guidance.

"someone used my credit card and ordered two 256gb iphone x's to my house.. weird thing happened to me recently...

i received a call from visa asking if i had recently made some large purchases . i replied ""no i haven't "". 


**the charges:**


$5000 ( triggered fraud alert)


$800 (went through, iphone on contract maybe?)


$800 (went through)








the bank then told me someone just called them pretending to be me and my card was compromised.

a week later i get two packages in the mail. i open them up, two 256gb iphone x's. one silver, one black.

**i'm guessing this is what happened:**

1) the fraudsters were testing the waters with the iphones before they made the big purchase.

2) they were hoping to intercept the package .

3) they just messed up.



anyone have this happen to them? 

**edit :**

- yes the charges were reversed.

- i still have the phones

- i'm going to contact visa about what to do.

- i don't have kids 

- not on any medications / wasn't drunk 

- getting a lot of messages about people wanting to buy them. im going to try and return them. they're not for sale :p 

- i don't need legal troubles. i highly doubt they won't come looking for these phones. 

- my apartment doesn't have gas. (carbon monoxide poisoning)

- what the frick?



**wow front page! , thanks everyone for all of the responses. helps a ton!**


**update 3:00pm pst:** talked with visa & credit security agent. they told me they don't deal with the packages / returns and that i should contact the merchant/cell phone provider. i am going to be contacting the credit bureau in the morning as well.
 

**update 4:00pm pst:** currently on the phone with cell phone provider. closing any accounts the fraudsters may have opened.


**update 4:30pm pst:** talked to the cell phone provider. no account was created under my name and they can't trace this purchase to me because i don't have an account. they told me i should just wait and see if they contact me again. they said they can't accept any returns because i need an account number (which i don't have).

**update 5:00pm pst:** just realized something... the address it was sent to is a number off. my address ends in a 2, the slip ends in a 4. it does have my name on it etc. it got to my house because the delivery guys know our last name most likely. the plot thickens. i do have new neighbours , but i don't think they could pull this off. super strange. 

**update 6:00pm pst:** just checked, the address ending in 4 isn't the new neighbours, they're my other neighbours, and they're pretty old.  i don't think i'm going to get much more info on this. i'm thinking i'll wait for a while before i consider the phones mine. i don't want to open it and then get charged for it. they may even be deactivated from apples side anyways. i'll open one after one month. 
 
**update 6:17pm pst:** proof https://imgur.com/a/lvkwf

**update (next day) 12:20pm pst:** 
i just called credit bureaus. the fraudsters tried to make cell phone accounts in my name. for some reason the cell phone provider couldn't find my name on file.  it's officially identity fraud at this point, and there will be an investigation. if anyone is in canada and this has happened to you, please call your bank as well as the following numbers.

funny thing just happened. trans union gave me the canadian anti fraud number, and i mistyped it. i typed 800 instead of 888 and it went to a sex line. for a second i thought i had been elaborately scammed and all of the people were it on it, then i realized the mistake.

"i thought i was paranoid, but i got phished. read my shameful account of said phishing so they don't get you too.. i have different passwords for every website i log into, 2-factor authentication when possible; i thought i knew all the scams and could spot them a mile away. this one still got me. 

i was meeting a friend at a bar. two drinks in i got a call from someone identified by my phone as wells fargo. i'm fully aware this could be spoofed, but it did not raise alarm bells yet. i was at a bar i did not frequent and have gotten calls from my bank before on suspicious charges that were legit, so i answered expecting this to be the case.

the person i spoke with said they were with wells fargo and they've identified fraudulent charges on my account but they need to verify my identity before they can discuss details. they said they sent me a text message (via the cell number they just called, which is my first clue this is phishing). they asked me to read back to them the 6-digit number just texted to me to verify my id. being two drinks in, slightly expecting what this was about, i had zero alarm bells going off. my bad, this was stupid of me. i read the number to them. they suggested it timed out and i needed to read another number they texted to me. minimal time had passed, a mild spidy sense was tingling, but i still was not concerned enough to ask questions and read them a second 6-digit code.

this person then read off 5 recent charges on my account, 4 of which i recognized as legit and a 5th that was a $1000 charge to a credit card i did not own. i immediately identified this as a fraudulent charge and they said ""no prob dude, we'll freeze your card and send you a new one"". they even gave me the last 4 on the card it was coming from. i was appeased enough to continue (sadly). 

finally, they said they sent me one final 6-digit code to confirm that they were crediting my account back with the $1000 fraudulent charge. i just needed to read off the final code they texted to me. at this point things seem weird to me but they got me at a good time. i was 2 drinks in, was interrupted from hanging with a close friend i hadn't seen in months and was outside trying desperately to avoid the loud noise inside the bar but still dealing with traffic noise outside. i just wanted to be done with this. i read them the final code and they thanked me and hung up. 

at this point, i see why my phone had been vibrating constantly through this call. i had 4 emails from wells fargo. 1) your user name has been reset, 2) your password has been reset, 3) welcome to zelle! an awesome $$$ forwarding service, 4) you've just forwarded $1000!!!!!

i called wells fargo via the number on the back of my card. after being on hold for 45 min trying to get the fraud department, i start to tell my story only to have the call drop (i'm pretty sure they hung up on me). i called back and was on hold for 1 hour 20 min (my account has been compromised >2 hours by this time) to get a second person. he told me this was a scam they've been dealing with for 3 months and i needed to go into a branch with 2 forms of id to deal with it. there was nothing he could do tonight.

tdlr: dude spoofed wells fargo when calling me on my cell, requested a reset of my user name, password and approval for $1000 transfer. i stupidly read off the confirmation numbers i received via text to him, he entered them into wells fargo website to approve all these requests. wells fargo has known their customers have been getting scammed for 3 months and didn't bother to warn anyone. i now have to go into a branch, hang my head and tell my shameful story to a person and beg for access to my account because someone else has control of it all night tonight.",10
"you will get calls about your taxes, there is a 100% chance they are scams. i just received a voicemail today that said there was a ""tax fraud pending against me"" and that i should call back immediately before ""i get arrested"". please be cautious as these are scams. if you **ever** have questions regarding your taxes, go to the place you filed them and start there, then go to the irs **directly**. pro-activity is viewed highly to the irs and you can alert them you received a call you believe to be fake.

"never look at monthly payments. negotiate on the final price.. this happens everywhere i go.
car dealership, ""so what do you want your monthly payment to be?""
insurance agent, ""great so your downpayment is $xx and your quarterly payments are $xx""
etc..

um, i want to know what the final out the door price would be?

""well tell me what you can afford and i'll see if we can make this work for you. so how much are you looking to pay a month?""

why is this bad? because you cannot compare apples to apples with just a monthly payment. sure they can make your monthly payment super low and just extend your term to forever so they make more money. or for insurance purposes you cannot compare that policy vs another one.

also you should know the true cost of the items you are buying. sure those $150 airpods at 5 bucks a month on your credit card is easy to afford. but once you factor in that 22% interest rate over how long it takes to pay it off were they really worth the $180+ you just paid?

i feel like majority of uninformed consumers should be considering the true cost of items vs they i can afford that monthly payment mindset. no wonder people live paycheck to paycheck thinking they cannot afford to have an emergency savings because all of their money is going towards those monthly payments.

wait emergency savings? i don't need that, i have available credit on my credit cards!",10
"a story of how i just got out of paying a $1500 bill, why you should never blindly trust a debt collection agency, and always request proof of a debt owed. 😂😂😂. i got a call out of the blue a little over a month ago from a debt collection agency, saying i owed almost $1500 from an ambulance ride i took because of me being involved in a car accident over 2 years ago.

while on the phone with the debt collector, i looked up debt collection laws, and after a couple minutes of research decided to request a debt validation letter, which they are legally required to send me within 5 days of initial contact. 

long story short, never received it. instead they sent me a ""verification of balance"" letter. which immediately told me ""holy shit, they don't have proof i owe the debt. which means i'm not legally required to pay this shit.""

today, right before the 30 day cutoff, i receive another call from them attempting to collect the debt. i request to speak with a supervisor. after going back and forth with him for a few minutes about why they haven't sent me a debt validation letter (which they're required to do under the law), he transfers me to his supervisor. 

this is where it gets fun. i'm now going back and forth with him. after a few minutes he puts me on hold. roughly 3 minutes later he comes back on and says ""sir, after reviewing your file, it doesn't appear we have the documentation required, pertaining to the original bill, in order to send you a debt validation letter. however i am showing you have a balance owed here in your file of $1,410.54. would you like to pay a portion of it now, set up a payment plan, or...?""

holy fuck. 

this dumbass just admitted to me they don't have proof of me owing the debt. which means im not legally required to pay it. it's null and void. 

i tell him this, he gets flustered, and after some more back and forth, basically tells me to have a nice day and hangs up the phone.

i'm going to still send a letter requesting a copy of the debt validation letter via certified mail with a return receipt requested, to cover my ass. and when they don't, because they aren't able to, it's a done deal. 

if they try to put it on my credit report, i just contact the credit agencies with proof of me asking for the debt validation letter and never receiving it, and it gets removed from my credit report. 

moral of the story, always ask for documentation. don't let debt collectors scaring you into paying a debt you may not be required to pay.

here's the bogus ass letter i received. http://imgur.com/yg9udzh

edit: this seems to be a pretty common question, so i'm editing it into the main body of my post. i'm being asked if i actually even rode in an ambulance and if i did i should just pay it.

i was involved in an auto accident because some girl ran a red light and tboned me going 50m.p.h., and i had to take 2 ambulance rides because of it. 

i contacted my attorney and he sent me an itemized list of all debtors paid after the settlement which was finished 2 years ago. 

there was a couple ambulance companies listed on there, but the amounts did not match the $1410 this debt collector was claiming. and without an account number, or any sort of identifying info, i was unable to match it to either of the paid ambulance bills in the documentation i received from my attorney. 

thus me attempting to clarify this with the debt collector, via a debt validation letter.",10
"(update) found out i was being paid less than entry level employees, what do i do?. hey guys! a couple weeks ago i posted about a situation at work where i was promoted to an admin and clinical position, and found out that i was being paid at least a dollar less than entry level employees. i was making $14/hr while others were making anywhere between $14.50 - $15/hr. i asked for advice, and the post blew up, to the point where i had to delete do to me being careless with personal info. i received a lot of advice to search for another job, negotiate higher than i was asking, and some pm's asking for my name and location and position in the company, which led to me deleting the post.

anyway, i met with the woman in charge of wages for my company, and the talk was very friendly and transparent. she said the person hiring people before me was ignoring protocol and absolutely should not have hired people at that rate. she said our range was significantly lower for hiring and that was a mistake on the previous person's end, since she showed me proof of emails that went on between everyone. 

i listened and acknowledged, and said ""i understand, but where does that leave me?"". originally they offered me a .25 cent raise which would bring me to $14.25, which i quickly countered and explained, calmly, why that wasnt a fair compensation. ""i feel with my qualifications and my value of being the only fully certified employee at my location, i think a .25 cent raise would not be very fair to reflect my role."" 

after 20 minutes, she realized i had never received my mandatory 90 day evaluation for a wage increase, never received raises for certain goals met, and other factors. i received a $1.50 raise to $15.50/hr, and i will be up for review again in april when my annual review comes up, where she said ""with everything you have done, the minimum you will see your wage go up is another $1.50. i would expect to be up to at least $18/hr when your eval is due, most likely more."" i requested that in writing so i'd have it and she happily obliged!

tl:dr - was being paid less than entry level employees, negotiated professionally thanks to advice from the sub, received a raise with another one coming in two months.

edit - forgot to mention, full back pay for the time worked :) also edited our irrelevant company info 

edit 2- im going to acknowledge this because i've been seeing a lot of people saying its a low wage and i should leave. ill admit, its not an ideal wage, however, the overall career benefit towards a higher wage and career is well worth it. they pay for graduate school in full, which benefits me as it is a top university they are affiliated with for my career path. they offer a lot of benefits most companies similar to mine do not offer or offer at a high cost to the employee. im well aware i could be making more, but something people on here forget sometimes is, life satisfaction. im happy where i am, and yes the wage isn't perfect, but i love what i do and i wake up every day excited to work, not dread it. i do look at it as a paycheck, but i am not unhappy. 

edit 3- didn't realize this would generate hate. well i'll break down even more: whether hr is screwing me with this new wage is honestly whatever you guys think. in my opinion, they took care of me as best they could. this is a position that doesn't require a degree, and hopefully when i receive mine this may, it will go up more in pay. the takeaway from the post was supposed to be that i was able to get a higher wage by being professional and collected. those of you saying to leave a job i'm happy at for money it baffles me. yes, i was unhappy with my pay when i found out, now that's fixed and i'm 100% happy again. it's a shame i have to explain that to reddit, but seriously, being happy and making okay money is perfectly fine for me. because this path and company will allow me to do both if i invest the time now. it's not about making a lot of money right away, it's about learning and perfecting your skills to make more money. i just get lucky enough to have both.

"seriously, get and use a credit card. i've encountered many people, both in my personal life and online, that insist upon using a debit card for their purchases, instead of using a credit card -- either because they don't yet have one, or because they have some fear of using a credit card. there are literally no cons to using a credit card if, and here's the catch, **you're responsible**. that's all. there are so many pros built in to using a credit card over a debit card. here are a few:

**it's safer!** when you use a debit card to make a purchase, you're essentially handing the merchant direct access to your bank account. should the waitress at the restaurant you're eating at write down your debit card number or should your favorite grocery store experience a breach, that's direct access to your account and your money. yeah you can file a fraud dispute with your bank and get your money back eventually, but in the meantime, that money is poof, gone.

compare this to using a credit card - when you do this, you're using the creditor's money to make your purchase and you don't have to pay it until your statement closes. you have a 30 day window in between payments to make sure that all purchases on your card are yours. and if there's a purchase you didn't make, that's not your money missing. 

**it builds your credit.** when you use a credit card responsibly, it will build your credit over time. which if you're young may not be a big deal to you, but eventually you might want to buy a car or house, and unless you have a lump sum sitting in cash, you're going to need to finance it. low interest loans are granted to people with good credit scores, meaning you pay the bank less in interest to use their money. compared to someone with poor credit who will either get a high interest loan or no loan at all.

the caveat here is that you never miss a payment. ever. a good rule of thumb is to only spend on credit what you can pay cash for at the same time. you should never buy something on credit that you couldn't otherwise afford at that same point in time with your debit card.

**purchase protection.** a lot of major credit card companies (like american express and discover) offer a suite of purchase protection features. this is especially useful when you buy big ticket items (like a flat screen tv or laptop, for example), because it adds a layer of protection to you, the consumer. some features are:

* accidental damage coverage - if you break your device in the first couple months of owning it, you can get it replaced by your credit card company.
* better price guarantee - just bought an expensive item but found a better deal somewhere else? the credit card company will cover the difference.
* theft protection - if your item is stolen within the first few months of owning it, your credit card company will replace it for you
* extended warranty - all my credit cards offer 100% of the manufacturer's original warranty on any purchase. 1 year manufacturer's warranty on my iphone becomes a 2 year warranty including the extra year of coverage from the credit card company. 

and many more.

**the credit card company will reward you for using it.** most credit cards offer points or cash back that you earn every time you swipe your card on things you'd already be buying anyways. same applies for paying bills. so by using a credit card, you can get a percentage of cash back or points that you can redeem later or put towards a purchase or vacation/trip.

some tips on using a credit card: 

* never miss a payment. ever. you will destroy your credit with as little as one missed payment.
* only buy on a credit card what you can afford to buy on a debit card at the same point in time. this is how people end up with $1,000s in credit card debt - because they use their card irresponsibly and then can't afford the payments. being responsible is the only thing it takes to use a credit card.
* pay in full - only suckers make the minimum payments. when you only pay the minimum each month, the credit card companies will charge you interest for using their money longer than the 30 day statement period. whatever you heard about making the minimum payment to boost your credit score is false. paying your card off in full achieves the same score improvements.

hopefully this post is enough to convince you to make the move to responsible spending with a credit card. they're awesome financial tools to build your credit and build your future as a responsible adult, and all it takes is responsibility and self control now.

here's a success story for you now that you've gotten through this post. a couple months ago my credit card number was skimmed and used several states away from me. the purchase was at a small convenience mart and was only a few dollars, as the thief was likely testing the card to make sure it works. my bank notified me immediately of the fraud alert. all i had to do was say it wasn't me who made the charge and it disappeared. never had to deal with it again. granted, a couple bucks didn't do any harm to me, but had that been a purchase of $1000 or more, that would have stung if it was my debit card that made the purchase.

i applied for my first credit card the day i turned 18. i now have four credit cards with $50,000 in available open credit across them and a credit score of 780 at age 23. all it took was a little persistence and responsibility. if i can do it, believe me, so can you.

"in order to get the lowest lease price possible, you must learn how to calculate a lease. here's a long and in-depth guide to how leasing works, plus real world examples from my most recent lease.. edit: i don't know if this shameless plug is allowed, but this post was so popular and it resulted in so many people messaging me over the last year that i decided to spin up a little company to help people negotiate their leases. i'm always happy to answer any questions on this post if you pm me (as i've done for dozens of people), but if you want someone to actually do the work for you or spend some time finding deals for you, then please don't hesitate to message me for more details. i am not so shameless as to list the company or website here, so just pm me if you want more info on having someone taking care of the lease for you.

i have seen a lot of posts recently about best practices with car buying, but i haven't seen anything on _how to_ lease a car. so i figured i'd write this up! 

ok, let's get this out of the way right away: leasing isn't for everyone. in fact, it's probably a bad idea for most people. but if you are going to lease, you need to know how leases work and where they get the numbers in order to get the best deal. and knowing the numbers may actually make you realize it's a terrible deal and to stay away. 

but for this post, i'm not debating the merits of leasing, just explaining how the math works, what your costs actually are and how to realistically minimize those costs. 

this post will include the following info:

- the math behind the calculation
- what kind of car to look for
- where to find the info you need
- how to negotiate the best lease

***the math***    

let's start with how the lease monthly payment is calculated. 

the formula is: payment = depreciation + finance charge.    
your depreciation is: ((capitalized cost - residual value) / number of months)   
your finance charge is: ((capitalized cost + residual value) * money factor   
so your total formula is: payment = ((capitalized cost - residual value) / number of months) + ((capitalized cost + residual value) * money factor)

pretty simple right? so what do those things mean?

capitalized cost: this is the amount financed. did you know in a lease, you are actually financing the depreciation? this can be higher or lower than the price of the car, depending on whether or not you are putting money down, rolling over negative equity, or tacking on fees into your payment. the lower the better!

residual value: this is what the manufacturer (or the bank, if using a separate lease provider) thinks the car will be worth at the end. it's expressed as a percentage. 50% or 0.50 means they think it will be worth half as much in the end. the more miles you want, the lower the residual will be. residual can also vary by trim package (i.e., the ""limited"" has a higher residual than the ""sport""). the higher the better!

money factor: this is the interest rate. for some reason, it's always actual interest rate / 2400. so 4% = 0.0016 and 0.9% = 0.000375. the lower (more zeroes) the better!

number of months: how long you want to lease for. sometimes manufacturers juice the leases depending on months. for example, vw wanted to move jetta glis off their lots a few years ago, and had insanely inflated residuals and ridiculously low money factors on 2 year leases, making them about $100/mo less than a 3 year lease.

refundable security deposits: this is expert level leasing. almost no one knows about it, even dealerships. but some banks allow you to put down a refundable security deposit in order to lower your money factor. this is usually for people with low credit to secure the rates of someone with higher credit, but some let people with top tier credit put down money to get an even lower rate. i was told by the finance manager and the sales manager at one toyota dealership that i was wrong. i asked them to call toyota, and they came back and said ""well, you learn something new everyday"". if you are doing a refundable security deposit, simply calculate if the reduced payment on your lease will be higher than the guaranteed return on your money. in other words, if you put down $3000 and get $20/mo off, at the end of 3 years you'll have $3000+20x36 = $3,720. that's a 7.44% guaranteed return!

***type of car to look for***   

to get the cheapest lease possible, you want to find a car that the manufacturer is discounting (this will reduce your 'cap cost'), which has a naturally high resale value (think honda or toyota), and a low money factor (triple zero!). 

you can monitor for specials, search online for deals, or call around when you are looking for a car. if manufacturers are advertising cheap lease deals, it probably means they are either discounting the car or offering a really cheap money factor. just realize that if it's being advertised, you can do better by negotiating. 

as with anything, google is your friend as well: i got my parents a great lease deal by googling ""current lease deals"" and finding out that mazda was basically doing interest free leases - they're driving a $30k car for $315 a month, with zero money out of pocket.

***where to get the info***   

so now you know you want to lease a car. you need to start filling in the blanks. what are the sources of this information:

- dealerships. they won't tell you easily, but if you make it clear you are a serious buyer, they'll share the real info with you. i've found that sales managers and internet departments are the most likely ones to share the info.
- edmunds tmv. this a great source to find out how much cars are actually selling for in your area. you can option the car and price it out and see if it's realistic to get a car below invoice or at msrp or somewhere in between.
- cargurus. i've found this site/app super helpful for knowing what specific cars are available in an area, what the average price is, and how long the car has sat for.
- edmunds vehicle specific forums. this is the best source i've found for up to date residuals and money factors. the mods of the forums answer specific questions on current vehicle offers.
- google. if you google ""money factor + residual + make/model"" you might find another source that will break it down for you. 

i like to find all of the numbers, plug them in, figure out what the monthly payment would be, and then start calling dealerships to confirm my numbers are right. this makes negotiation easy - figure out what you want to pay, figure out a reasonable price, and then find someone who will sell it to you for that. speaking of...

***the negotiation***   

here's where it can get tricky. even if you know the numbers and know what you're trying to do, they'll still try and add stuff on. there are curveballs everywhere. 

also, it's going to be rare that you'll find a sales person who will dive into calculating at this level. they will ask you about monthly payment, your trade-in, what you want to pay. you need to be firm and stick to your plan. the last time i leased this led to me walking out of one dealership after they wouldn't play ball. their loss, i walked into one the next weekend and leased the same car for less than i was willing to pay at the first one. 

the key strategy is this: _focus on the sale price of the car_. you already know the money factor and residual. those are driven by the bank and the dealer can't budge (unless they find you another bank). you want to negotiate the lowest sale price possible. this is where the edmunds tmv and cargurus info is so helpful.

do not talk about down payments. do not talk about monthly payments. do not talk about trade-ins. do not talk about _anything_ except the sale price of the car.

why is this so important? because the residual is always calculated based on the msrp of the car. but the closer the residual is to the sales price, the less depreciation you are financing. so the lower ""sale price"" you can base the lease on, the cheaper your payment!

some other tips to think about when negotiating: 

- never put money down. all a downpayment does is reduce your cap cost. but if you drive off the lot that day and get slammed by an 18 wheeler and have the car totaled, you'll never see that money again. never put money down.
- if you can, sell your car privately. don't trade it in on a lease. why? see above. it's money, and it may disappear. there are obviously exceptions to everything, but in general, don't trade a car in.
- watch for additional fees. dealers charge for document fees ($100-$500, may or may not be negotiable) and a host of other factors. ask for these to be separated out, then decide if you want to lease them. when your money factor is near 0, you may be ok with ""financing"" these costs. but you may just also want to pay them up front (note: this isn't a down payment).
- taxes: these vary by state, but in my state they're based on a prorated lease rate. so it's a monthly payment of (6.5% x calculated monthly payment) is added on to your total payment.

so what are some real world examples:

i currently lease a 2017 toyota 4runner off road premium. the msrp of my car is $40,500. toyota was running a lease special of $399/mo with $2,999 down, plus taxes and fees for a base sr5 that goes for about $37k. seems like a great deal, right? and i should be paying more for a more expensive vehicle than their current special, right?

well, i looked up on edmunds and found out that the car was actually selling for closer to $38k. cargurus confirmed this, and also showed that several were available near me and had been sitting on lots for a couple weeks. i did some research and found out the residual was high for a 3 year, 36k mile lease (i think 65%) but the money factor was kind of meh (0.00225). let's see the differences, using the msrp:

payment = ((capitalized cost - residual value) / number of months) + ((capitalized cost + residual value) * money factor)

((40,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = ($40,500-$26,325)/36 = $393.75 +     
((40,500+ (40,500 x .65)) x .00225) = $150 = $544/mo .   

ok, now let's play around with this a little bit. let's remove $3000 from the ""capitalized cost"" after we learn that the average edmunds selling price is $2500 below msrp (and we're going to negotiate a little better than average).   

((37,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = $310 + ((37,500+(40,500 x .65)) x .00225) = $143 = $454/mo

we just dropped almost $90 off the price by knowing what we can actually get the car priced out. how do we lower the price a little more? turns out, toyota will drop the mf from 0.00225 to 0.00153 if you put down $3600 in fully refundable security deposits, returned in full at the end of lease completion. let's run the math again.

((37,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = $310 + ((37,500+(40,500*.65)) x .00153) = $98 = $408/mo

another $50 off. we dropped our interest rate from 5.4 to 3.67 and the price came down accordingly. 

now, let's plug the same numbers in and push for a dream price: $36,500. that gets my payment down to $379. with a tax of 6.25%, my final payment will be ($379*.0625)+$379 = $402. since my goal is $400, it's now to time to call some dealerships and see if they'll play ball.

i took out my cargurus app, found what was on their lots, did the exact math based on exactly how they were optioned (typed the same exact cars into edmunds), and then made specific offers and was transparent about the info i knew:

""hello dealer, i see you have a 2017 4runner on your lot with xyz options. i believe the residual is 65%. my research tells me the money factor is 0.00153 with a $3600 refundable security deposit. if you'd be willing to base a lease off of a cap cost of $36,500 with no money down, then i will come in today to sign paperwork"".

notice a few things: i share numbers that show i'm serious and have done research. i make an offer and tell them i'm ready to close the deal. i don't mention monthly payment. i confirm the numbers. 

the results of this effort: two dealers were interested. one dealership told me to come in, then wouldn't move off msrp. when i complained to head of biz dev at the dealer, he told me i obviously worked for toyota - ""why don't you just use your own discount to order it from the factory?"". he was serious too, and said that no one who wasn't in the car industry would have the knowledge or info i had. i sent him links to cargurus and edmunds and never went back. the other dealer told me to come in.

now here's where it got interesting. the sales manager asked if i'd be open to working with another bank besides toyota. he brought out a sheet from a local credit union and shared their numbers (this is something i've seen that happens when you make it clear you know what you're talking about and are serious about buying: they stop bs'ing you). 

the money factor on this bank's lease was .00165 (3.96%). higher than toyota's lowest, but no security deposit. and the residual was 0.68, also higher than toyota's.

((37,500 - (40,500 x .68))/36 = $276 + ((37,500+(40,500 x .68)) x .00153) = $107 = $384/mo

another $25! now this is getting good. now's when we started the real negotiation. i pushed for $36,500 and said i'd sign on the spot. we ended up settling on $36,900 after some back and forth. 

final price: $366 for the car, $23 for the tax, $389/mo total, $1500 out of pocket, $40,500 car.
what was toyota's advertised deal at the time? $399/mo, $3000 down (includes fees), for a ~$37,000 car.

so by knowing how the lease works, i got significantly more car for less money per month, no money down, and the same out of pocket costs!

now, we still had to finalize a couple other things:

- gap insurance: you need this on a lease. the bank i was leasing included it, but apparently toyota does not. so another $10/mo or so in savings.
- acquisition fee: unfortunately, the bank makes you pay an initial fee to take possession of the car. in my instance, it was about $800, which was about $150 more than the toyota lease. i could have added this to the cap cost and paid about $20/mo more, but i decided to pay this up front.
- first month's payment: varies by manufacturer, but i chose to pay this up front as well.
- plates, title, registration, etc: varies by state. i paid them up front as well
- document fees: dealerships often inflate these to make money, since they often don't make money on the car itself. you can push and negotiate on these, but sometimes they'll waive them and sometimes not. and if they do waive them, you'll probably pay for it in the sale price of the car. i'm ok with a business making some money, as long as i know exactly what it is. i paid this up front as well.

if i had rolled all of those fees into the lease, i would have basically been financing $1500 at 4%. now there's the argument that if i rolled it in and got into an accident, the gap insurance would basically pay for it. overall, it would have added about $50/mo to the cost of the lease, so i paid it all up front.

so in the end, i took possession of the car for $1500, didn't have a payment for 30 more days, and now owe $389/mo for the next 3 years on a $40k+ truck. if i want to buy it in the end, it's simply the residual cost ($27,540). if i choose to buy it out before then, it's simply a matter of getting a loan or writing a check for the current buyout price that month.

so to summarize, if you are going to lease:

- know how a lease works
- use your internet resources to find out the current manufacturer rates for your car, but be open to different banks
- learn the points to negotiate the lease on
- don't negotiate monthly payment
- reach out to multiple dealerships, but be straightforward, respectful, and up front.
- don't put ""money down"", but realize it may make more sense to pay some things up front.



***bunch of edits/follow-ups:*** 

- well, i didn't expect the front page and 2 golds (thank you!). i was just trying to do a knowledge dump that i could share if people had questions on their lease. i always assumed my pitbulls or cat would be the thing that got me to the front page.
- the audience was /pf, which is generally against leasing. i wasn't interested in that debate, and there are plenty of sources out there to decide if a lease is for you or not, or when it makes sense and when it doesn't. leasing isn't necessarily the cheapest way to drive (although it can be), but sometimes there's more to life than spending the least amount of money as possible to make it through your day. but there's no reason to overpay for something that you are getting, especially if understanding how it works can save you money. 
- if you are going to lease, please do more research than this post! i was just sharing what i've learned. i wanted to share the numbers from mine to show how the payment can go up and down, and then shared where i found the numbers and how i approached the process. not trying to claim it is the *best* way, just that if you are going to lease you should understand the mechanics of it.
- i got a few pms and messages that i said not to put money down and then i did. this is a valid criticism. the first payment is due at some point and i'd rather use my rewards card than ach for that, so the only out of pocket money i paid was the acquisition cost, doc fees, and title/reg, which was about $1100 total. in hindsight, i should have just rolled that all in and had a higher monthly payment. at the time my reasoning was that it's not cap cost reduction and i didn't want to ""finance"" the acquisition cost. in hindsight, the same logic applies - if the car got totaled, i'd be out that money. so do as i say, not as i do!
- thank you to everyone who provided feedback on typos and errors. i believe i fixed all of the math format edits and mixups on switching cap cost and msrp. if you see any other errors, feel free to pm me and i'll fix them.
- several people mentioned leasehackr.com. it's an awesome site and has a great calculator. if you aren't comfortable with building your own spreadsheet, just use theirs! they also have great breakdowns on things like the deal of the month if you are just looking at getting cheap leases.
- as someone said in the comments, please be respectful to folks if you're buying a car. i personally think having #s and doing research makes it easy for everyone because it removes the ""is this guy bs'ing me?"" part. even the dealership that i walked out of in frustration, i thanked the sales guy for his time and told him to call me if his sales manager was willing to budge on price. but the dealer i did buy from, the sales manager said ""you'd be surprised how many people think i'm trying to screw them when i offer leasing through our 3rd party bank"".

and finally, i'll say it again: if you are going to lease, please research beyond this post. don't make 3 year commitments for thousands of dollars based on one guy's post! hopefully my post helps you understand a little more how it works and provides a starting  point for research, but it wasn't meant as a be all and end all comprehensive guide!",10

# best of the best

*obviously, these are my personal opinions.  this is not financial advice for your situation and you should do your own research before applying for any cards*

## best all categories cash back

### if spending < $1,000 / mo.
**citi doublecash** 2% interest with no annual fee and no restrictions makes this my current catch-all card.

### if spending > $1,000 / mo.
**alliant cu signature visa** if you plan to spend more than $11,800 / yr on this card then 2.5% cash back more than covers the $59 annual fee, especially in the first year when all purchases receive 3% cash back.

## categories

### you choose

**us bank cash+** select 2 categories of your choice and receive 5% cash back up to $2,000 / qtr is just about the best i found anywhere.  pretty much the only way i found to beat this is with a small army of cards dedicated to separate categories.

### dedicated
**costco** and **amazon** amazon nets 5% and costco nets 4% back total on purchases with those retailers if you have a membership.  so if you already have a membership and frequently shop at costco / amazon both of those cards seem like pretty good deals as well.

## promos

### by %
**chase freedom unlimited**, **us bank cash+**, & **bank of america cash rewards** all offer $150 when you spend $500 in the first 3 months which is an astounding 30% back!

### by $
despite the annual fee **capital one savor** offers a $500 promo if you think you are going to spend more than $3,000 in the first 3 months.  personally i am not a fan of the annual fee associated with this card, but if you are just about those promo offers, $500 is nothing to scoff at.

# summary

selfishly, i made this list for myself as i was deciding which cards to apply for.  i already have strong credit, but i wanted to find cards that i could keep open long term to build my credit as my lifestyle changes, so my #1 rule was ""no annual fees.""  without an annual fee there is no penalty to keeping the account open by purchasing a snickers once / qtr so my average account age can grow.  while there are a few cards with annual fees that have nice benefits, i personally didn't find that they wound up outweighing the chance that my lifestyle would change or a better card would come along and i would need to close the account.

**personally, i wound up applying for the citi doublecash & us bank cash+**.  if i find that i am spending more than $1,000 on the citi doublecash i will probably apply for the alliant signature visa since i will be over the breakeven point.  as for the us bank cash+, i really like this card because i can see keeping it open for quite a long time due to it's great rewards and flexibility to adapt to life changes.

*please let me know if i made any mistakes or if you have a better card that should be on this list!*

i can't keep up with all the comments so i am just going to list suggestions here without all the details

"equifax will allow consumers to lock & unlock their credit report for free for life. interim equifax ceo's message in wall street journal:

on behalf of equifax , i want to express my sincere and total apology to every consumer affected by our recent data breach. people across the country and around the world, including our friends and family members, put their trust in our company. we didn't live up to expectations.

we were hacked. that's the simple fact. but we compounded the problem with insufficient support for consumers. our website did not function as it should have, and our call center couldn't manage the volume of calls we received. answers to key consumer questions were too often delayed, incomplete or both. we know it's our job to earn back your trust.

we will act quickly and forcefully to correct our mistakes, while simultaneously developing a new approach to protecting consumer data. in the near term, our responsibility is to provide timely, reassuring support to every affected consumer. our longer-term plan is to give consumers the power to protect and control access to their personal credit data.

i was appointed equifax's interim chief executive officer on tuesday. i won't pretend to have figured out all the answers in two days. but i have been listening carefully to consumers and critics. i have heard the frustration and fear. i know we have to do a better job of helping you.

although we have made mistakes, we have successfully managed a tremendous volume of calls and clicks. and we're getting better each day. but it's not enough. i've told our team we have to do whatever it takes to upgrade the website and improve the call centers.

we have started work on our website, and i see significant signs of progress. i won't accept anything less than a superior process for consumers. we will make this site right or we will build another one from scratch. you have my word.

the same goes for the call centers. there is no excuse for delayed calls or agents who can't answer key questions. we will add agents and expand training until calls are answered promptly and knowledgeably. i will personally review a daily report on their operations.

we will also extend the services we are offering consumers. we have heard your concern that the window to sign up for free credit freezes with equifax is too brief, so we are extending the deadline to the end of january. likewise, we are extending the sign-up period for trustedid premier, the complimentary package we are offering all u.s. consumers, through the end of january.

we hope these immediate actions will go a long way toward addressing the concerns we are hearing from consumers. we know they won't solve the larger problem. we have to see this breach as a turning point—not just for equifax, but for everyone interested in protecting personal data. consumers need the power to control access to personal data.

critics will say we are late to the party. but we have been studying and developing a potential solution for some time, as have others. now it is time to act.

so here is our commitment: by jan. 31, equifax will offer a new service allowing all consumers the option of controlling access to their personal credit data. the service we are developing will let consumers easily lock and unlock access to their equifax credit files. you will be able to do this at will. it will be reliable, safe and simple. most significantly, the service will be offered free, for life.

with the extension of the complimentary trustedid package and free credit freezes into the new year, combined with the introduction of this new service by the end of january, we will be able to offer consumers both short- and long-term support for their personal data security.

there is no magic cure for data breaches. as we all know, every organization is at risk. when consumers have access to our new service, however, the cybercrime business will become a lot more difficult, and we are committed to doing what we can to help millions of consumers rest easier.

mr. rego barros is interim ceo of equifax.",10
"you do not have to give your employer 2 weeks notice.. i have seen my company terminate 2 other employees as soon as they gave their 2 weeks notice.

i gave my 2 weeks notice on wednesday and on friday was told they were terminating me and they were not intending on paying me for the remainder of the 2 weeks. fortunately i am able to start monday with my new company.

as a word of warning, if you have seen your employer terminate any employees as soon as they give notice do not give notice. you are not legally required to give notice, and if the company does not give the courtesy of letting employees finish out their 2 weeks they don't deserve the courtesy of 2 weeks notice.

"as a former car salesman, these are the common fallacies that people used to justify purchasing a new car.. there are 4 basic reasons people came in to purchase a car.

current car is messy:
i sold a ton of cars to people who's current car they hated simply because it was dirty. some elbow grease or paying for a good detail could have saved them $20k.

wanted new technology:
i sold $50k cars weekly because of bluetooth capabilities. no matter how old your car is, you can add this to any existing car for around $200. cheaper if your diy.

wanted it as a status symbol:
cars always look amazing at a dealership where they are waxed, clean, and smothered in armor all and tire shine. in two weeks the difference between your old car and your new car will probably be negligible. the whole status symbol thing really only lasts a few weeks. most of your peers don't know the difference between a new and much older models if they are both dirty.

mechanical problems:
this is the only reason i would advise anyone to purchase a car. eventually the repairs get to the point where its more expensive to keep it than to move on. if you are buying a car for anyother reason than this... don't!

edit: reading the comments, i figured i should address some general thoughts. 

safety isn't something i meantioned before, but probably should have. regardless of how reliable a car is, if you are driving something with a rusted frame and 20 year old safety features its time to upgrade (assuming you can afford it). my wife and kids drive in a 5 star crash rating car with every modern safety feature. we have chose to be stingy in other places in our finances so we can afford to have a car with these types of features. its worth a little bit of money to us to know our family is safe and to be able to see when backing out of the driveway. 

that moment when repairs out way the cost of upgrading is tricky. i have been burned several times by spending money on repairs that i thought were a good investment only to have more and more repairs pile up. i wish i knew some perfect rule for this. i don't. i have repaired cars i shouldn't have and i have gotten rid of cars that probably would have been great with minor investments.

"i negotiated salary for the first time ever, and i got what i wanted!. last tuesday, i did something irresponsible for the sake of my mental health and quit a job where i was miserable, without another job lined up. as the sole income provider this was a huge gamble, but i had an interview on friday that i was feeling really confident about. 

i should pause here to note two things: 1) i'm a codependent, and avoid conflict like the plague. 2) i am this way because of my childhood, being raised by my narcissistic mother. my former boss was exactly like her, hence why i left. 

so, i killed the interview on friday. met the two attorneys i would be working for. they are amazing and offered me a job at the end, but said that they would need the senior partner's approval first, so to wait for his call. 

i got the call this morning. we went back and forth a little bit. my starting point was $x, he wanted to offer x-$7k. he noted that health insurance is 100% employer-contributed, and not only was i getting 2 more weeks of pto than my last employer, but i would get pto on my bday (this is actually an awesome perk because mine almost always falls around a federal holiday, which means the potential for a paid 4-day weekend).

i said meet me at x-5k, so he said he'd do x-7 but cut me a personal check each month for gas allowance. when i incorporated that in, i was almost sold. my husband told me to ask for an additional $50. what's the worst he can say, no?

well, codependent me was terrified to ruffle the feathers. but i thought, although beggars can't be choosers, i'd potentially miss out on an extra $600 a year for the sake of not hurting someone's feelings. 

so i asked. and he actually said that he was taken aback, and felt like i was nickel and diming him! but you know what? i stuck with it. i said, ""yes, well, i am very eager to start, so if you can meet me there, i can start tomorrow."" he said he had to get back to me.

and wouldn't you know, he did. i got that extra allowance. i stuck to my guns. i put conflict aside to make sure he knew right off the bat that i know what i am worth. and it felt amazing.

you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. and let me also just add that it feels really good knowing you're earning a salary you can support a family on, and that you made it happen by being assertive. it's just a huge weight off my shoulders, that i won't have to worry about whether i can pay all the bills on time.

"my credit union offered me an appointment with a financial advisor after depositing an inheritance check. when she called i asked if she was a fiduciary. she said yes. when i showed up i found out she's actually a broker but ""considers herself"" a fiduciary. this is some bullshit, right?. i'm extremely annoyed. i feel that i've been subjected to a bait-and-switch. when she called to set up an appointment, i said ""before we do that, are you a fiduciary?"" she said yes. i said ""great, i'd love to set up an appointment!"" when i got there i saw a plaque on her desk saying she was a broker. i read online that a broker is not the same as a fiduciary. i asked her about it and she said, ""let me explain to you what a fiduciary is... blah blah blah... so i consider myself a fiduciary."" 

she thinks that i, 30, should invest my inheritance in a deferred annuity for retirement. i have ~60k earmarked for retirement and the rest of the inheritance earmarked for current emergency fund and paying off current bills.

"my fiance just got unexpectedly fired today and we're both now reminded why r/personalfinance is always insisting on trying to live off one income.. we were both blindsided by today. we're both pretty young, early on in our careers, he had only been there a year and was performing. it was a huge shock. we don't practice every best habit of the sub but we're grateful we picked up doing your best to live off one income.

we just bought our house in august and insisted on going through the pre-approval process off my income alone.  our lights will stay on because our bills are effectively scaled to one income as well. we held off on car payments and continued to drive our beaters because the numbers for new used cars didn't make sense with one income.

my only regret is not building up our emergency fund more (one month saved but we should've had at least three), so if you're reading this, definitely do that.

anyways, thanks to the sub for the constant advice on living below your means and always being prepared. i came to thank you all, not lecture. and encourage people who are following this thought process and are using a second income for the ""extra stuff"" - you're doing great. today sucked but it could've been so much worse.

we're counting our blessings and the job search begins tomorrow.

**edit:** thanks everyone for the encouragement and well-wishes. this obviously isn't the only thing going on in our lives, so the messages to keep going were greatly appreciated. 

for those of you who are in hcol areas or other situations where living off one income isn't possible, i totally understand - the intent of this post wasn't to shame anyone into anything. we live in a mcol city in the south and are in the tech sector so it was doable for us. we're also not beacons of perfection of this sub and are still working on breaking bad financial habits every day. 

for those of you who took this as a self pat-on-the-back post, i can see that. the intent really was to see the silver lining of things and encourage others who are perhaps considering this type of budgeting method. but i understand how fast this sub gets into circle-jerking and self-congratulating and didn't mean to purpose this thread for that. just hoping to reduce the amount of ""we're in deep shit from one event that could've had a much lower impact"" posts by showing anything can happen at any time and that even then, we weren't as prepared as we should've been.",10

"macy's new employees are encouraged to open a store credit card (26% apr) to obtain their employee discount. i recently picked up a part-time seasonal position at macy's for some extra holiday cash. i've been working in retail off and on over the past 15 years, and am familiar with the hiring and management practices at a lot of places, but it's been a few years since i've worked for a big retailer like macy's. i was very surprised and disappointed to learn that the 20% employee discount  is only available through a prepaid card (like a gift card i guess, not terrible but not great), or through their *actual store credit card*. they conveniently inform you of this halfway through your new hire paperwork, and even allow you to apply right then and there.

i've been through this type of application process before, but i've never seen something so brazenly unethical. these are often young adults or older people applying for these positions, filling out so many forms with so much corporate legalese that your head would spin, and they're being targeted with a (hard hit, thanks auto mod) hit to their credit for a card with a ridiculous interest rate. is this new in retail? seems like a disturbing trend if it is.

anyone have any thoughts on this? just wanted to get the word out.

edit: thanks for the replies, everyone. really enjoyed the discussion about credit cards, business practices, and obviously pf. the consensus seems to be that store credit cards are not any worse than other forms of lending, as long as they are managed responsibly. i respectfully disagree, in that it seems like they are often offered to a range of people (namely, new employees) that may not have the knowledge or experience to handle a line of credit, but i will agree that it's fair game to solicit employees. i just think it's kind of shady to imply that a store credit card is an ""easy"" solution for employees. employees should just get an effing discount, period. but we're all free to work and shop where we please, so feel free to support smaller/local businesses that don't subject their customers and employees to frivolous lending situations.",10
"aren't you embarrassed?. recently, i started a second job at a grocery store. i make decent money at my day job (49k+ but awesome benefits, largest employer besides the state in the area) but i have 100k in student loans and $1000 in credit cards i want gone. i was cashiering yesterday, and one of my coworkers came into my store, and into my line!

i know he came to my line to chat, as he looked incredibly surprised when i waved at him and said hello. as we were doing the normal chit chat of cashier and customer, he asked me, ""aren't you embarrassed to be working here?"" i was so taken aback by his rudeness, i just stumbled out a, ""no, it gives me something to do."" and finished his transaction.

as i think about it though, no freaking way am i embarrassed. other then my work, i only interact with people at the dog park (i moved here for my day job knowing no one). at the grocery i can chat with all sorts of people. i work around 15 hours a week, mostly on weekends, when i would be sitting at home anyways.

"if the only reason you pay for amazon prime is because of 2-day shipping, there is a good chance it's a smarter financial move for you to cancel it than continue.. this got removed from r/lifeprotips so let's see how it goes here...

i've paid for prime since it was available, and lately i've noticed it's gotten increasingly worse with shipping.

**fyi** \- prime doesn't mean you will get an item in 2 days, it means you **should** get the item 2 days **after** it ships, and there will often be multiple days between order and ship date meaning *a $119 prime membership often gets items delivered to your door 3-5 business days or more after you order*.

edit: they also no longer offer a 1 month prime extension for shipping errors(https://www.dealnews.com/features/amazon-quietly-killed-a-popular-prime-shipping-perk/2207696.html)

**example**

* you place 24 orders on amazon prime over the course of a year
* 4 of those orders arrive over 2 days after you place them online due to multiple days ""processing"" or shipping errors (for me it has been much worse than this)
* that effectively means you paid $5.95/order for 2 day shipping

look at how often you purchase, how quickly items are delivered, and decide if that's worth paying $119 for. if you only have it for the 2 day shipping there is a good chance it's not, especially when you consider many other online retailers carry the same items and now ship free with walmart (i know they're the devil but it looks like amazon might be too) even offering free 2 day shipping on many items without an extra membership fee.",10

"i raised my credit score by 73 points in 3 months and got myself out of debt thank to this subreddit. i know i still have work to do but i wanted to share my small success story and some gratitude to this sub for helping me get my finances back on track. 

in late 2013 i was out of work for several months due to an illness, and just a few weeks after i returned to work my husband was laid off. i had a small emergency fund but medical bills and keeping the rent paid on time meant that i was left with some sizable amounts of debt, some of which went to collections. i ignored my credit through 2014 and 2015, since i honestly didn't know how to fix it. 

then i found this subreddit. i read every post that seemed at all relevant to my situation, and read all of the amazing information provided here. towards the end of 2016 i finally decided that i was ready to fix my situation and get back on track. 

in october i signed up for credit karma. my credit score was a dismal 590. i thought it was insurmountable, but i took it one step at a time. i treated it like a game -- every sunday i would log on to ck (as well as several other score providers) to see how many points i ""earned"" that week. 

to start, i found a few old collections accounts that were either inaccurate or were being reported past my state's statute of limitations, and disputed them. to my surprise, the very next week every single one of them had been removed from my report. there is still one small $200 collection account on my report (one that wasn't disputed because i legitimately owe it), which i plan on tackling next. 

i now make a good salary but frequently found myself low on funds at the end of the month, due to poor budgeting. i signed up for mint and monitored all of my spending to see where my money was going. i cut cable, stopped eating out so much, and cut some other unnecessary expenses. coupled with taking on some extra side work on evenings and weekends when i could, i was able to put over $1,000 a month into savings, when previously i struggled to save even 1/10 of that. 

next, i tackled my credit card debt. i started with about $2,800 in credit card debt, which isn't very much but my utilization was near 90%. every extra dollar i had went to those two cards until they were paid off. i paid off the lowest balance first, since the interest rates were the same for both cards. seeing that first $0 balance reported to my credit report was really nice. once my utilization was under 50% i called capitalone and requested a credit line increase, which they provided, taking my utilization down to 31%. i continued paying down my debt aggressively and now have 0% utilization across both cards. it took about 6 weeks to pay these off due to my new aggressive budgeting strategy. 

finally, i called my credit union (car loan) and asked them if they would be willing to remove any of the late payments that were reported during my unemployment, because it can't hurt to ask. to my surprise, they listened to me, saw that my payments had been current since i started working again, and removed 3 late payments from my report as a ""good will"" adjustment. i still have 3 late payments reported, but 3 is better than 6. 

today when i logged in to credit karma my score was 663. all of my credit card debt is paid off, my car loan will be paid off in 3-4 months and i was able to replenish my emergency fund *and* start saving towards a down payment for a house. 

seriously cannot thank this sub enough. i've never posted here before but i must have read every single post here over the past 3-4 months, and just wanted you to know that i'm grateful to those of you who take the time to answer questions and help people get their lives back on track. 

happy new year! 

**a small edit since this post got a little more attention than i anticipated! (wow,  thanks everyone :))** 

first, i have gotten some pms and comments assuming that this post was some sort of ad for ck, and i assure you it isn't (lol). credit karma was one of several score services i utilized, and i initially signed up since i saw it mentioned so frequently on this sub. i mentioned it by name simply because it was the service i used (& continue to use) most frequently. i've also received some messages from people who, for some reason, don't believe that my post is true, and that was certainly unexpected. if the mods are amenable i would be happy to post screenshots with personal information redacted. the purpose of this post was to remind everyone that a series of seemingly small steps forward can make a bigger difference in a smaller amount of time than you might expect. 

i also appreciate the advice to check my ""real"" fico score. i did that this morning and to my delight it was actually 667, so a couple points higher than my ck score :) 

i'm very humbled to hear that my story was inspirational to some of you, and wish everyone great success in the new year! ",10
"i'm a 16 year old tasked with getting my senile 67 y/o father on food stamps, free government phones, etc and i need help.. for starters, thank you for reading and no need to write in layman's terms. 

**tldr**; my dad is physically and mentally unfit to get himself on government aid and my siblings have given me the job of helping my dad get on a plethora of government assistance plans. i need help doing so. 

my father is 67 years old and has tons of mental and physical issues. he has diabetes in addition to a wide range of mental issues we think he could have. he's never been professionally evaluated, but we think he has bi-polar disorder and is a paranoid schizophrenic.  he also has a tough time speaking due to his old age and not being a native speaker. i am the only one in the world that can decipher his jumbled language most of the time. he gets overwhelmed very easily and has a hard time remembering a lot of things. he currently has zero income and it's been that way for years. we think that he is being sent money from offshore relatives but no one can be certain. we are about to sell the house next month because he cannot afford to live in it any more. my parents are divorced and my dad has no legal custody of me. we live in wisconsin. i am willing to impersonate him on the phone with people. he is totally find with it since i have to do it for him all the time. 

task 1: get him a free phone service. he has a phone already so we just need a sim card with service. 

task 2: get him on food stamps

task 3: figure out what type of health insurance he has. i've asked him for the paperwork of his insurance and he doesn't know what i'm talking about so i need a way of finding out. he definitely has something i just don't know what. 

task 4: get him on social security if he's not on it already. i don't know how i would find out since it's the same deal with the health insurance. 

task 5: get him professionally evaluated for mental illness. also find out what government assistance is available to those who are disabled mentally. 

task 6: get assistance in buying pet food. he has a cat (which is one of the few things keeping him relatively sane) and needs help caring for him.

task 7: get him surgery for his arm. his bicep sags on one arm and he can barely use it. 

tasks 1-4 are really the essential ones. i just need to know where to start and what i need. this is pretty difficult in addition to school so that's why i am asking for so much help

thank you very much for those who read. please ask any more follow-up questions you have. 

by the way, this is a throwaway account because this post contains a lot of personal information. thanks again.

"reminder: paying rent is not ""throwing away money"". one thing i see over and over again on this sub is people thinking they need to buy a house because they are ""wasting"" money on rent. this is a fallacy and not the right way to think about rent. as human beings, there are several things we need to survive, including food and shelter. paying money for rent is no more a ""waste"" of money than paying for food is. 

while it is true that when you buy a home a portion of your monthly mortgage payment will be going to principal, and therefore you *are* paying yourself in some ways, however, the cost of home ownership is significant. some of the lesser known costs include the lack of flexibility, stress, the risk of home price declines, home maintenance, real estate taxes, and hoa fees. 

i recommend looking at the following calculator for a better idea of the true cost of home ownership. 

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?mcubz=0&_r=0

also keep in mind that this does not account for opportunity cost of being able to move (i.e. you find a job in another state that you can't take because you're underwater on your home or the burdensome costs to move closing costs).

edit: i think too many people in this thread are reading this post as saying that home ownership is bad. that is not at all the point. in many situations, owning a home is absolutely preferable financially to renting. the point is that a home is likely the most expensive thing you will ever buy; it is not a decision to be rushed into simply because you are ""wasting"" money on rent. it is *not* a waste of money to rent until you have the stability necessary in your life to make the decision to buy a home. there are even some markets or situations where it may never make sense to own a home, and that is okay.

"what i wish people told me before i got $16,000 in cc debt. quick background. i got my first credit card by accident. i thought i was filling out a ""loyalty card"" at cabelas. ended up being a line of credit. i was 23. 

4 short years later and married with a baby girl, i find myself with $16,000 in credit card debt. i actually saved my very last dollar and have it taped to my steering column in my truck. and when i say last dollar i truly mean it. we had negative balance in the bank and overtaxed all our cards. 

less than two years later, we now have $16,000 in savings and no credit card debt. (we finance one of our cars) 

credit card debt is crippling. my dad calls it the ultimate slavemaster. it forces you into depression almost by default and controls every aspect of your life. 

here's my list and i hope it helps you. i'm no guru, i just learned the hard way. 

1. you will not pay it off later. when 'later' comes, you'll be buying other things to pay off later. 

2. read dave ramsey's money makeover. it's got good tips and the tactics work. 

3. the jones' can suck it. they're miserable and controlled by debt also. don't buy things you don't need to compete with people you don't care for anyways. 

4. pick up a side hustle. i taught myself to make skateboards, and would handmake 2-3 a week to sell to help pay off the debt. my wife picked up birth photography 

5. talk to your boss, ask what you can do to take a bigger paycheck home. 

6. be a bitch about your budget. set it and don't stray from it. 

7. put post-it notes with $0.00 written on them at the office, in your car, on your mirror, on your phone background. seeing that everywhere actually reminded me of my goal of achieving $0.00 cc debt. not sure if it legit made a difference but i think it might've 

8. become emotionless toward money. i would get so pissed that i was dumping hundreds of my paycheck into debt payoff. it was only till i stopped giving a f#&@ that it became easier to make bigger payments. 

9. save nothing until it's paid off. it doesn't make sense to save money when you have cc debt growing exponentially in the opposite direction. 

10. when in doubt... overpay. if you run short on money in your checking, but whoop, dip into the cc for 50 bucks. keep basically nothing in your bank account because ""you spend what you have."" my family could live off of $75 a week. but if we have $300 to live off of, guess what... we would use $300. so i would always put as much as made sense. a few times i overpaid but it forced us to be frugal. 

11. unsave your cards on amazon. so if you go to buy something you have to go through the hassle of finding the card and filling in the fields. 

these are just some of the silly things i picked up along the way that i think would've helped me stay out of the mess. we are so happy now that we worked our butts off to become financially stable. i hope this helped!

edit: so many awesome comments! i understand these are basic tips and not hardcore financial advice. so please leave your advice, even if you disagree with my tactics because there's a lot of comment lurkers who are scanning for more advice, so keep all the comments coming!",10
"how my wife and i never fight over money. you get married and then it's living happily ever after, right? well...

a few months after we were married, my wife came home from target with a couple of large shopping bags.

*""what did you buy this time?!""*

no, i didn't say that out loud. i'm not *that* stupid. 

but the thought did run through my mind, and it concerned me.

why was i so upset over a trip to target? i love allison! i trust her, and i know she's responsible. 

she didn't come home with a new car. she didn't gamble away all our savings. so what's the big deal?

then it hit me. 

**i couldn't answer the question, ""are we okay?""**

we were married and happy except when it came to money. every day, my wife used *her* money from *her* bank accounts, and i was using *my* money with *my* credit cards. 

i realized that we were still paying the bills and shopping like we were roommates rather than like a team or a family.

and as i thought more about it, i discovered that how we used money was only *part* of the problem.

at the time, i had just started a career as a financial advisor, and i was being paid with a combination of a fixed salary and commission. the amount i was making was changing every month.

edit: i left the financial advising career about 4 years ago. wasn't for me.

allison had a stable job, but her hourly rate was low. plus, her job was centered around tourism, so the number of hours she worked went up in the summer and dropped in the winter.

at any given moment, we had no idea if we were spending ourselves into a hole or climbing out of it.

we could compare how much we were charging on our credit cards and how much money was in our bank accounts, but that got complicated. 

we had 8 accounts at 5 different banks. answering the question, ""are we okay?"" took a shit-ton longer than it needed to.

allison and i weren't working or planning together when it came to money, and i wanted to make a change.

all i wanted was to answer the question, ""are we okay?"" without getting a degree in accounting.

**we learned how to handle money as separate people.**

before getting married, allison and i really were separate people.

we both had savings accounts, checking accounts, and credit cards to manage. we learned how to pay bills in our own apartments with our own roommates (who were also our groomsmen and bride's maids).

allison and i ended up moving in together for the summer right before we got married, so we were--from a legal standpoint--roommates rather than a family. we got used to paying the bills and shopping as separate people.

looking back, combining our lives and becoming a family needed to happen. we realize now that this moment was inevitable, but no one ever taught us how.

**we were responsible as individuals, but not as a couple.**

i figured that if we didn't start working together with our money, the ""target incident"" would just get worse.

* if i needed a new suit for work, could we actually afford it?
* what happens when we want to go on vacation?
* would allison start to resent me for spending a lot of money on craft beer?
* would i start resenting allison for buying another purse?
* what if we go further and further into debt without knowing it?
* what if we want to buy a house?

i love my wife, and i trust her. but the way we were going, i didn't trust *us*.

**no one ever taught us how to handle money as a team.**

no one ever taught me how to handle money as a spouse. fortunately, i have great parents that i got to watch, and i learned what a great marriage could be. but they never talked about money around me.

in high school and college, i learned how to balance my checkbook, use a credit card, and pay my bills. but it's easy to make decisions when i don't need anyone else's opinion or permission.

allison and i needed to do something different, and it was up to us to change.

**we needed to find some help.**

i was on edge to begin with. trying to network, gain clients, and work long hours already had me stressed out. worrying about my clients' money didn't leave much energy at the end of the day to take care of our money.

any time we needed to go shopping was stressful. hanging out with friends made me feel guilty. we live in florida so of course we like to go to orlando (*""sea world...disney...putt-putt golfing.""*).

i wanted to worry a lot less about money, have some fun, and not ruin our marriage in the process.

it was time to find some help.

**what were the problems we needed to solve?**

allison and i already worked well as a team. we were both responsible, but we had separate financial lives that needed to be combined somehow.

i realized that the three basic problems we needed to solve were:
* how do we see all of our money in one place so we don't miss anything?
* how can we manage day-to-day decisions without nagging each other?
* how do we financially and emotionally support each other in our goals and dreams?

this took some time to figure out.

**step 1: see everything in one place.**

the first thing we did was to get everything into one place. i had been using the app, mint, for years to help track my own stuff. so we decided to start a new account. edit: i took out the link for mint to help out with the thumbnail issue. i'm guessing you can find the app just fine without it.

edit: i am not an employee of mint, nor am i being paid by them. i'm just a fan, and the app has worked well for me. the comments on this post also strongly suggest (but are not limited to) ynab, good budget, personal capital, everydollar, mvelopes, and quicken. you could also use excel, google sheets, apple numbers, or any other spreadsheet software you are comfortable with to budget and keep track of your finances.

* every savings account.
* every checking account.
* all the credit cards.
* student loans.
* car loans.
* every transaction.
* updated automatically.
* all in one spot!

the clouds parted and the angels sang.

we both had access to see everything at any moment on a computer or our phones.

**step 2: give each other permission to spend money.**

the next step was to start budgeting together, and i had to talk allison into this. she had some valid concerns, and it all started with toothpaste.

since i'm a detail-oriented person, i was gung-ho about budgeting and tracking our money. i love it when everything works together perfectly. whereas allison has more of a ""good enough"" personality. she was happy as long as we were staying out of trouble.

so when i started to talk about budgeting, one of allison's first questions was, ""if we spend our budget for toiletries and we need toothpaste, i can't go out and buy more toothpaste?""

it was a good question, and i didn't have the answer right away. over time, we've learned how to budget each month without making the budget set in stone. it's flexible, and when we need to change it...we change it. toothpaste for days!

allison also asked, ""and what if we want to go shopping on our own? do we need to give each other permission?""

the solution here was to budget fun money for each other. every month, allison gets some money that she gets to do whatever she wants with. and every month, i get some money that i get to do whatever i want with. sometimes we overspend our fun money amounts (okay, honestly...it's usually me), but we make it work out.

edit: we also have an ""entertainment"" fund in our budget every month, which is for anything we do together. you could call it ""date night"" money, too.

after making a lot of mistakes, hitting road bumps, finding solutions, and practicing, our monthly budgeting hasn't caused any fights or headaches....for years.

**step 3: decide what we want, together.**

when it came to our goals and dreams, we tried a formal system of tracking what we wanted. but it didn't really work out. it was too much for us as a couple.

our bigger goals like an emergency fund, retirement, and debt took some time, but those goals take *months* or *years* or *decades* to accomplish. once we set the plan, there was no need for a conversation every month.

for the shorter-term ideas, we developed a habit of asking each other, ""what do you want this month?"" 

sometimes i want new running shoes. sometimes allison wants to throw a party at our house for friends. and sometimes we both want a new dining room table.

in the end, we just wait until an idea pops into our mind (*""is it time to go back to disney world?""*), and we decide if we can afford it now or we need to save up. and then put it in the budget.

it's flexible, and it works for us.

**i calmed down...fast!**

after all our financial information was in one spot, i immediately calmed down. 

i had one number that showed me how much combined money we had in ""the bank"" and one number of how much we had charged on the credit cards.

one number minus the other gave me my answer. we were okay.

after we started to budget, seeing a target bag (or any other shopping bag) hasn't bothered me since.

**we never fight about money.**

allison and i have had a lot of fun with friends, visited family, and had wonderful vacations. but we have made a lot of mistakes and have had to deal with a bunch of emergencies.

we talk, discuss, and decide. but we don't fight.

"(can) i'm 17 years old, stranded in a rural home, taking care of dozens of animals on a $50 per week income, for an undetermined amount of time. i'm completely lost.. so, twelve days ago, my great-grandma had a stroke. my grandmother, my legal caregiver, went to the local hospital (a ripe two hour drive away) and has stayed there ever since to ensure that the doctors don't take her mom off life support. my aunt, my other caregiver, and her kids went with her.

so long story short, i'm home alone. i've been home alone for over ten days and have had to take care of the family's two sheep, two goats, five dogs, three cats, six large birds, dozens of chickens/ducks/quails/guineas, two horses, and a rabbit to boot

the people taking care of me don't know when they'll be home. they're not gonna let the doctors let my grandma die so they're gonna stay there until she dies naturally or recovers, which could be months. i've expressed my concerns through text and have only been met with ""i don't knows"" and the like. they've come home twice (for a couple hours) just to check on things but aren't making money themselves so they haven't been able to help.

i'm basically taking care of a house and all these animals alone at 17.

i'm not sure what to do. eventually bills will start popping up and the animal are already low on food.

i have a weekly shift at mcdonalds to fund myself, but in the area i live, the bus to town runs very rarely so taking full time hours isn't an easy solution. 

i go to school as well since a school bus goes through my area. (though i'd be willing to drop out if needed)

tl;dr: fending for myself, as well as dozens of farm animals, for an indeterminate i make almost no money and live in a rural area.

**edit:** thank you for your replies, i'll read them all and respond when i'm out of school in a couple hours!

**update:** thank you all for replying, i'll try to get through as many as i can but i honestly did not expect this to blow up like it did. anyway, i talked to my family and while they're not returning home, my aunt has come back with cat and dog food so the animals won't starve for now. she says she doesn't know how much longer they will be gone but don't anticipate it being months like they originally thought. i'm going off her words here. i also talked to my manager and am getting three evening shifts this week over my usual weekly one, so i'm not gonna be completely broke. the bus rarely comes through but i'm fine killing time in town if it means more money coming in. i won't drop out of school either. i was just panicked and assumed i'd have to work full time. i'll update more as events unfold",10
"how to determine if you can really afford that car. i keep seeing posts where people are struggling with their budget but have some ridiculous car payment. let's have a little discussion for people who are looking to buy a car. here's some advice i'll give. your mileage may vary (oh yes i went there). this advice is in usd but works anywhere. 

don't get stuck holding the bag on a car that depreciates faster than you pay it off. i've done the math at a bunch of different interest rates, and the bottom line is that 48 months is the magic number for loan terms. at 4 years or below, you're typically safe. maybe you can push the boundary at super low interest rates, but there are other reasons not to finance for too long, including risk of financing a used vehicle for longer than expected reliable service life. 

next, write out your full budget and see what you have room for. here's where young folks get trapped: maybe if you're still in school or fresh out of school and have super low living expenses, it will appear like you have tons of room for a fancy car. as soon as you become fully independent with a real place to live and food needs and all that jazz (which will very likely happen within a few years), that magic car budget will vanish before your eyes. be realistic. account for all the standard living expenses, fun budget, savings, and then be honest - what do you really have to spend on transportation each month? for a lot of people, it'll probably be a few hundred bucks. then, subtract what insurance and gas and other associated fees will cost you, and multiply what you're left with by 48. that's what you can afford to finance (including interest!) 

does the number come out well under $10,000 (or equivalent low amount for whatever country you're from)? for many people, it probably does. don't be discouraged, for you can get a great reliable car under ten grand. 

does the number come out to less than $5000? very common! save up and buy a car in cash.

i feel like people tend to look at $20k as cheap for a car, but it's not cheap at all. include taxes and fees, finance over 5 years at 5% and you're looking at well over $400/mo. then tack on insurance (easily $200 for a young driver), and then tack on gas. that $20k car costs you $500-700 per month! if you aren't bringing home $5k+ each month, that probably doesn't fit in your budget. the reality is, even a $20k car is not realistically affordable for the majority of income earners. 

what about $30k+ cars? radio commercials make them sound so affordable, but cars in the $30k-$40k range should be seen as luxury vehicles. we're talking six figure income required. yet, so many people buy $30k suvs and get screwed by the monthly payments. please don't let it happen to you. 

i work in a respectable profession and make a fairly decent wage. people always ask me why i drive a 10 year old car. it's because that's what i can realistically afford! society in general has inflated expectations on what they can afford. it's time to fix this and save people from ruining their budgets.

"update: bank of america refusing to return $700+ in fruad charges after 180+ days. solved!. we got our money back after two days! http://imgur.com/gallery/lpjxhqt(http://imgur.com/gallery/lpjxhqt)

if you are looking for information on what to do if your bank declines fraud purchases or your bank refuses to return your money, please read this so you can see what steps we had to take to get something done.

i just wanted to post an update to anyone who followed along on my post last thursday about the issue we were having with bank of america declining some very obvious fraud charges and giving us the runaround for 180 days. for those not familiar with the situation, you can read up on it in detail here: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ac96zf/180\_days\_later\_bank\_of\_america\_is\_refusing\_to/(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ac96zf/180_days_later_bank_of_america_is_refusing_to/)

tldr: july 15. fruad on our debit card in texas while we were in illinois. 180+ days later, bank lies to my wife after repeated phone calls. i ask for help on reddit. it goes viral. you guys give big help.

after posting on thursday, i took the advice of several redditors and took the several steps on friday. here is the timeline of events leading up to this being closed out.

* **8:00am friday:** called  jonathan stickland, my local texas house representative and left a message explaining the situation
* **11:00am friday:** submitted a complaint to the consumer finance protection bureau (cfpb - https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/(https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/))
* **12:00pm friday:** my wife called me and told me jonathan stickland's assistant had called her to gather more information and said she would be making some calls to see what they could do for us.
* **4:00pm friday:** wife called me to let me know that someone from bank of america's ""regulatory complaints department"" had called her in regards to the cfpb complaint filed earlier in the day. he called at 10 minutes before his office closed and my wife didn't get the message until after. we planned to call monday morning.
* **9:00am saturday:** wife wakes me up and says the money is back in the account as a ""misc credit""
* **9:00am today:** i call cfpb. they say the complaint is still open with the bank and they usually respond within 15 days.
* **9:00am today:** i call the number left by bofa's regulatory complaints department. leave a voicemail. wife calls him from work and leaves a voice mail
* **1:00pm today:** we get a notification from bank of america that the dispute is closed. we're done. we will wait until the notice comes in the mail before we shut our accounts and move.

i hope that anyone else in our situation now or in the future can use this to get some fast results too.

thanks to everyone who commented with advice, their own stories, and kind words to keep me motivated throughout the process.",10
"at&t ran my credit not only without my permission, but after i explicitly stated i did not want a hard hit. i called in to ask what internet speeds were available in my area. he tried to sell me on cable, which i declined. he asked for my social and my date of birth. i asked him why he needed this and he explained it was to make sure i didn't have any past due balances with at&t. i then double checked and asked him if it would hit my credit and he chuckled and said ""no no sir nothing like that"". 

fast forward an hour, i have an email stating my installation for phone, cable, and internet is scheduled(???) and then a few minutes later an email from credit karma saying i had a hard inquiry. 

called in and spoke to 3 different departments, finally to a woman to tell me she couldn't remove it because calling in to inquire about service was all the consent they needed. 

this clearly doesn't seem legal, and wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences and what i should do next. 

tl;dr - spoke to att, they asked for social, i made sure it wouldn't hit my credit, i was told it wouldn't, and then it did. what next?  

edit 4: filed a complaint with my attorney general. 

edit 3: filed a complaint with the cfpb. all the support and advice here has been a true blessing and i thank each and every one of you for taking the time to comment with good advice and/or possible solutions. 

edit 2: i called back in, and actually had a great conversation with someone who was super understanding and willing to help. she got me to the fraud department. i spoke with dorothy. she told me that it **did not matter** that i asked my credit not to be ran. that when someone calls in to inquire about service, they are consenting to a credit check. doesn't matter if i didn't give my social, they would have used my dob or dl #. she told me that i could not speak to a supervisor as this was standard practice, and she wouldn't escalate it. she also said some calls are recorded and some weren't, and she did not help me in finding the call from my first conversation. i then asked her for a copy of this call and her response was ""i don't know if it's being recorded so i can't help you"". she had nothing to say about the rep lying to me, and she said their credit disclaimer statement didn't sound anything like a credit disclaimer statement and i probably didn't even know it was read to me. unbelievable. this is their fraud department. jesus christ. 

edit: i see a lot of folks saying ""what's the big deal, couple points will fall off in no time"". i just got an email from credit karma that a hard inquiry from 2 years ago just fell off my report, and that left me with one hard hit which was back in january. i've been working very hard on rebuilding my credit, checking quite frequently and really boosting my score. one or two points may not be a big deal to some but after working so hard to improve my score, having it lowered without my authorization or consent is devastating.

"wife had yearly review today. instead of a higher wage, they converted everyone from hourly to salary, but her overall salary reduced by 14k per year.. wife works for a very small start up company with 4 people, 2 owners and 2 employees. she is in design. past year she was working at $35/hr full time with health benefits but no paid vacation. $35/hr is very fair for her skillset in design especially for los angeles. she was on wage, not salary. she worked some ot but not a whole lot. if you calculate the standard hourly to salary using 40 hours a week multiply 52, she would have earned $72,800. she is normally scheduled to work full time mon to fri 9-5. however last year we got married and had vacations here and there and she was compensated $55,000 total because of the unpaid vacations. this worked out well for her small company because she didnt get paid while being away. 

today during her evaluation, they low balled and offered  a salary of $54,000 with $3800 pto/year. health benefits are also included but it is the same as last year. the total compensation now is $57,800. they said this was calculated based on the number of hours worked last year (so they pretty much offered her 2018 w2). employees are not going back to wage. 

i would assume an employer would calculate a salary offer based on potential full time hours, not how many hours one worked the year prior.  if she had pto last year  or if she didnt go on the long honey moon then she would have received a higher salary offer. now her starting salary is pretty much $27/hr so its a huge downgrade and now without ot. the owners said ""well look we are giving you pto now!"" which would offset the low ball. she is valuable at her company— 70% of products sold are her designs. the other employee got a raise cause he was getting significantly less paid last year (due to no degree and no experience) in case you were wondering. 

is this practice normal for an employer to use previous year's w2 to determine someones salary, especially if it works in their advantage? she will try to counter back with equity (since she started the company with them). during their meeting yesterday, they stated that employees' salary do not require 40hour work periods — only the projects need to be done. because of that she wants to request working a maximum of 32 hours a week to offset the 14k a year reduction. any advice?

**1st edit** i shouldnt have wrote this long piece and gone to sleep. i will answer everyone when i get to a computer. thanks for all your help. 
first thing, i need to recalculate her w2 because she definitely didn't take 3 months off which everyone is calculating.  a big piece is missing here. i saw that in the last 17 paychecks she got paid 43k and i need to double check

second, she is very valuable to her team. anyone is replaceable but she is more difficult to replace. she knows their vision, she came up with the  company name, and all her designs are most of the ones being sold now, plus she designed the logo, all the packaging, website, everything. everything has been her idea. when she pointed out the products to me on their website, most of them were either made by her or she had some type of influence directing the other designer. she had some creative director responsibilities too.

the reason why they are doing salary is because ""it helps employees out"" by more flexible scheduling (dont need to go in if work is all done).  this is true. however they r low balling her because they are not making any money right now and simply cant afford her right now. (its true they arent making money). she asked for equity at the first meeting yesterday and they said ""thats probably not the best idea for you because we arent worth much."" wtf! 

**2nd edit**
i am reading a lot of responses and they are all helpful but i can't respond to all of them. one thing to clarify is that i know for a fact she didn't take 12 weeks of vacation. thats ludicrous! they did shut down for 2 weeks or so during the holiday, and she didnt get paid for it. she also doesnt get paid for holidays (like during thanksgiving and such). we took a max of 3-4 weeks of vacation last year, not 12. i am going to sit down with her tonight to get the math straight.

so lately money has been pretty tight for me, i lost my job a few months ago and have been trying to uber full time to keep up payments, but its been an uphill road. recently i posted on craigslist attempting to sell my switch and xboxone, and made a deal with someone where they claimed they'd be sending me a check in the mail...

&#x200b;

so when ups showed up with an envelope i wasn't surprised. however, this check is written by the **harama entertainment corp**, for $1,550. i was only selling the consoles for $450 total. does anyone have any idea where this could have come from? is it safe to deposit? the check had no context attached to it, just the oversized ups express envelope. this seems a little too good to be true...

**update:** /u/sirglass hit it right on the money, the buyer wants me to ""hold"" the cash until his ""shipper"" can pick up the switch and the extra money in the check. i'm shredding the check and relisting my consoles asking for cash only next time. i really was trying to talk myself into thinking this could be my debt relief, but this is clearly a scam. thanks to everyone for keeping me sane.

**edit 2:** for those asking how anyone could fall for a scam like this or even consider it, it's a mixture of desperation and feeling ignorant about banking matters. as a student with bills being automatic and rent going through venmo i didn't immediately see the check as a red flag, just an ""older"" way of paying for things. also when everyone else was trying to lowball me, this guy offers me the asking price which made me want to deal with him. honestly if the check had been the exact amount and not $1,100 more i probably would have just went straight to the bank.",10
"what to do if you've been kicked out of your family home as a teenager: a pf guide. unfortunately, posts on this topic are not a rare occurrence here. teenagers are often kicked out of their home without support, sufficient money, or time to prepare in advance, but there are some resources and options for teenagers in this situation.

this guide also includes some information for teenagers who are at risk of being kicked out.

# first, please seek help

if you need help, there are confidential and nonjudgmental services with trained helpers that you can call or contact online. sometimes these services get busy. if you can't reach someone right away, please try again until you reach someone.

in the case of a life-threatening emergency, please call the police or the emergency telephone number for your country (e.g., 911 in the united states).

in addition to the below resources, consider talking to an adult that you trust and/or an independent institution or service provider with community knowledge and resources. there are many options such as:

- a teacher, sports coach, or staff member at your school

- a school guidance counselor, school nurse, or doctor

- a relative that you trust

- a family doctor or nurse

- a religious leader

- a librarian

  while most are not trained explicitly in this area, librarians tend to be resourceful and very good at research if you're feeling overwhelmed.

- a staff member at local shelters, food banks, soup kitchens, etc.

  even if you aren't interested in that specific resource, they tend to be sympathetic and familiar with local resources.

- another adult you trust

  it doesn't have to be one of the above options. someone like a friend's parent or even a neighbor may be a good option for getting advice, sorting through your options, and avoiding mistakes. most adults have a decent amount of experience dealing with government agencies, navigating complex situations, and have had their share of troubles too.

# some housing options to consider

read through all of these before you settle on which options to try first. if it starts to be too overwhelming or you need help, please reach out to one or more of the resources listed above for advice and support.

1. **if your home living situation was not abusive** and there is an option to make up with your parent(s) or caregiver, please consider it (even if it means a curfew, chores and hard work, or following rules you don't like). you can use this time to save up more money, find work, finish high school, and generally prepare for living on your own.

   if things are uncomfortable at home and you're allowed to simply spend more time elsewhere, that's often a good option to reduce tension at home. some ideas: get a cheap gym membership, do your studying at the library, get a part-time job, join an after-school group, or volunteer.

   if you have fundamental disagreements with your family or caregivers and this would be a possible reason for you to be kicked out, it's probably best to delay announcing these until you're on your own and doing well independently. maybe they are not great people. maybe you don't believe in the same things. as long as you are safe, it can wait until you are in a better position to be independent. as they say, the best revenge is living a good life.

2. it's generally illegal for your parent(s) or guardian to actually kick you out. **if your home living situation was not abusive**, one option to consider is contacting the police to get back into your home.
    - if you're an underage child (under 18 in most of the united states) and not legally emancipated, it's almost always illegal for parent(s) or a guardian to kick you out.
    - even if you're an adult or legally emancipated, but living at home, it's generally illegal to kick you out without following the relevant laws including sufficient notice. the specifics depend on the circumstances and your location (you may consider posting to /r/legaladvice as well).

  contacting the police may be unpleasant and you will need to listen to the police officer, but your parent(s) or guardian will also need to listen and allow you back into their home. you shouldn't be carrying anything illegal (drugs, alcohol if you're underage, or illegal weapons) in general regardless, but absolutely do not have any of those items on you or in your room if you contact the police.

3. if you have any relatives that you can reach that would let you stay with them for any period of time, this is one of the best available options if you've been kicked out. aunt or uncle lives in the next state? call them and find a way to get there. any non-abusive relative that you know is probably a better option than heading to a shelter. grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, step-siblings, you name it.

4. failing that, your next best bet is to contact friends, crash on a couch, and ask anyone you know that might put up with you. try to consider *any* workable and safe options. for example, your ex's parents liked you and you're on good terms? call them and ask if you can sleep on their couch for a few days until you figure something out.

5. while you're living on someone else's dime, in a place that isn't yours, friends, family, shelter, whatever it is, try you best to be on your best behavior.  that means:
 - try to avoid drugs and alcohol. if you need help with substance abuse, please reach out to some of the resources linked above.
 - try to respect any rules of the household or establishment and stay out of trouble.
 - keep your space clean and maintain your personal hygiene.
 - try to avoid being a negative presence.

6. it may be very difficult to find a better option, especially on short notice, but living and sleeping on the street is very dangerous, especially as a teenager. **contact one of the above help lines and they will help you find a safe place to sleep.**

## united states

if you're 16 to 24, job corps(https://www.jobcorps.gov) is another option worth investigating (some adults with documented disabilities above the age of 24 are also accepted). under the age of 18, you will need the approval of a parent or guardian.

job corps offers free education and vocational training, dormitory-style housing, food, work clothes, and other resources to help prepare youth for independent living and the opportunity to learn skills needed for a job that's somewhat better than an unskilled minimum-wage job. it's completely free for those that qualify and are accepted into the program.

# preparing if you think you might be kicked out or may need to leave soon

1. try to avoid accelerating the process and use any time you have to save up money and prepare. your own safety comes first, though.

2. try to make sure you will have a place to stay. if you can sleep on a couch for a month and save up more money before renting a room, do it. you want to save up money as much as reasonably possible.

3. try to have your birth certificate, identification, passport, diplomas and anything else you will need. store important documents at the home of a trusted friend or family member if possible. note that your parent(s) or guardian aren't obligated to give you their copy of certain documents and you should not put yourself at risk to retrieve these because you can order a copy later (link for united states(https://www.usa.gov/replace-vital-documents)).

4. plan for the worst case even though it might not happen. your parents may not support you going to school, fill out financial aid paperwork for you, etc. if you can't afford to pay for school on your own, you may need a different plan for continuing your education such as going to community college while working.

5. if and when you need to spend money for a place to stay, try to spend as little money as possible on rent. that usually means renting a room instead of an apartment, having some roommates, etc.

# financial accounts

- joint bank accounts can be emptied by either account holder at any time so if you're old enough to open your own bank account (18 or 19 in the united states), open a new bank account *at a different bank* from the one used by your family. local credit unions, online banks, and online credit unions are popular recommendations here. use a local credit union if you will need to deposit cash.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions)

- if you're not old enough to open an account where you live, see if an adult that you trust will help open a joint bank account with you. when you are old enough to open your own account, open one as soon as possible and transfer your money over.

- sign up for electronic statements and consider using a different postal address (e.g., the address of a friend or trusted adult) so statements don't get delivered to your home.

- if you're having trouble finding an bank or credit union that will allow an adult that isn't a parent or guardian to open an account with you, the money account(https://www.capitalone.com/bank/checking-accounts/teen-checking-account/) offered by capital one 360 is one option in the united states.

- check your credit report(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ad5f5h/30day_challenge_1_get_on_top_of_your_credit/) and freeze your credit(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) (sign up for credit monitoring before freezing your credit).

# school

## united states

if you're still in high school, ask a guidance counselor or principal at your school about continuing your education. the mckinney-vento act is a federal law that mandates the right of students regardless of their housing status. the law provides resources and support including provide transportation, free meals, and other services.

if you have questions about federal student aid, and are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless read this guide from the department of education(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/homeless-youth.pdf).

"don't sell the stocks in your retirement portfolio because of the drop in the market!. i've seen a few questions asking if investors should sell their stocks and move them into treasury bonds or a money market account. the answer is no.

markets will always go up in the long term. dips, corrections and crashes are unavoidable, unpredictable and won't hurt you in the long run. just hold onto your investments and wait it out.

the only way you can lose money when the market is down is if you sell. if you hold (or buy if you have cash to invest) you will make money in the long run.

edit: you all got me! i wrote this post to stop people from selling so that my own portfolio wouldn't lose value. as you all know the best way to manipulate the global equity market is to write a post on reddit.",10
"checking my builder's home warranty saved me $38,000 on repairs. i bought a townhome in 2009 that i now use as a rental property. last summer when i was visiting the home i noticed the floor in the kitchen had sunk a couple inches. i'd heard previously from my neighbors that they'd had the same problem.

when i bought the home, the builder had given a 2/10 warranty which covered the any defects in the foundation for 10 years. i decided to pay the $200 to submit a claim and have them inspect, fully expecting they'd find some reason to deny my claim, but they didn't.

today i have a check in hand for $38,000 and a bid from a contractor to make the repairs. if i hadn't thought to check my warranty or if i'd waited even 6 months my warranty would have expired and i would be paying that out of my own pocket.

don't forget to check to see if your repairs are warrantied.",10
sell the things that aren't bringing value to you anymore. 5-$20 per item may not seem worth the effort but it adds up. we've focused on this at our house and have made a couple hundred bucks now.. it also makes you feel good knowing that the item is now bringing value to someone else's life instead of sitting there collecting dust,10

"stop freaking out about ""the recession"". hi personal finance!

i see an awful lot of threads here about people wondering how on earth they'll possibly survive this horrible doomsday recession that is just absolutely going to happen any day now.  here's some tips:

1) there is not a gigantic country-destroying recession that is coming to ruin your life in the coming weeks.  talking heads have been predicting one ever since the last recession.  the current news cycle is little more than fear-mongering (full disclosure: i used to be a journalist).  if the current indicators that people are looking at end up holding true, it's still well over a year before things are ""expected"" to go south.  plenty of time to shore up those savings accounts, make sure you're budgeting properly (see below), etc.

2) the last recession was called the great recession for a reason - it was a harder-hitting one than those that came before.  and since it was largely based on a housing crisis, it felt even worse because people were losing their homes due to ridiculous mortgages that they never should have been offered, or agreed to, in the first place.  which leads me to...

3) just be smart.  are you living within your means now?  great!  make sure your emergency fund is in good shape, and continue about your business.  if you're overspending, take a look at your budget and see what you can cut out of it.  this is something you should be doing regardless of how the markets look.  find a cheaper cell phone plan, ditch that $100 / mo cable bill, subscribe to a slower internet package, go out to eat less often, etc.  

4) ""what about my stocks?  should i sell all my stocks?""  no!!!  do.  not.  sell.  your.  stocks.  the only exception here is if you really are completely and utterly broke otherwise and absolutely need the money.  look, i invested almost all of my life savings in late september last year.  and then watched a lot of it go away - on paper.  but guess what?  it's all back already, and then some - because i didn't panic sell.  in fact, **the best thing you can do in a recession is buy more stock!**  a bad market just means that stocks are on sale.  who doesn't love a discount?  again, i wouldn't advise buying unless you have the budget to do so.  

so there you have it, friends.  the world isn't ending.  be smart with your money, use some common sense, and be prepared to make some small sacrifices in the short term *if* a recession hits.

update 1: thanks for the silver!

update 2: i was working my first ""real"" job in 2008, but the pay was so bad that i was not investing much.  then over the next nine year, i didn't invest one single cent out of fear of another big market drop (just left it in savings).  i ran the numbers, and if i had been investing in the s&p 500 at my original rate that whole time, i'd stand to be up about $200,000 at retirement.  **i potentially lost $200k by not investing out of fear of a market turn.**",10
"are there any legitimate part time work-from-home jobs that aren't a scam?. looking to make a little extra income as a side job after my full day gig is over and also on weekends. was thinking of doing transcription, but not sure where to begin. if anyone knows of any legitimate part time work from home jobs that does not require selling items i'd appreciate it!

edit: just wanted to say i am very overwhelmed by the amount of comments on this post. please know i am reading each of your comments. thank you all for your insight! i really didn't think this post would have so many ideas!",10
"free tax filing software program offered to anyone making <$64k.. with tax season fast approaching i wanted to make everyone aware of a little-known fact that if you make less than $64,000 a year you are eligible for free tax filing and preparation(https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free). 

the government has a contract with tax prep companies like h&r block that allows for free tax filing for 70% of americans. you can use the tax prep software that companies normally charge for without paying a penny if you go through the irs's website. the program opens in january to file your 2017 tax returns.

the irs's advertising budget for this program is $0 so very few people realize it exists. last year only 2% of eligible taxpayers used this system. most people paid the companies to prepare their taxes because they weren't aware of this great program. it is literally the same programs the companies charge for being offered for free. 

*if you're interested in why companies would offer their products for free it's because it prevents the government from offering a free filing option. so long as tax companies offer free filing to 70% of us taxpayers the government will not offer a competing tax prep option, per the contract. they just work very hard to make sure no one actually knows the free filing option exists so we continue to pay them to prepare our taxes.* 

**use this program and please tell everyone you know so they can take advantage of it too.**",10
"eli22: personal finance tips for older young adults (us). yes, it's me....back with a second installment in our series, eli22.  this assumes you read eli18(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tfc76/eli18_personal_finance_tips_for_young_adults_us/) ( even the links...you'll learn 10x more from the links!) and have done  things pertaining to your situation.  

the ""22"" here  means you're done with full-time education, have a career with meaningful income, and are responsible for your own support.  some people start this at 18, some at 26; age is not important.  specifics pertain to the us in some cases.  this assumes you are a single childless renter employee; eli30(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uoycd/eli30_personal_finance_tips_for_thirtysomething/) will cover marriage, home ownership, and children.

you have money now, congratulations!  read this(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) excellent summary of how to handle it.  here's a ginormous flowchart(https://i.imgur.com/1rpekgq.png) showing what to do first: bills? loans?  investments?  good self-study!  we'll highlight three big ideas to get you started.

- **taxes**. your employee income is taxed / withheld like so: 7.5% of the first $118k goes to social security/medicare taxes(https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751.html). (we hope you will benefit in the future, too!)  then your income is taxed at higher rates(http://taxfoundation.org/article/2016-tax-brackets) as you make more.  assuming no special deductions, 0% for the first 10k due to standardish deductions.  then 10% of the next 9k, 15% of the next 28k, and then 25% tax rate kicks in; this is your rate from 48k  to 102k gross income, so a popular rate.  (it's only 28% up to 200k, as well.)  this is your tax bracket / marginal tax rate.  (most states also have state income taxes of ~6%ish but they vary a lot.)  higher brackets only affect your additional income; you always come out ahead(http://blog.taxact.com/how-tax-brackets-work/) even if more income means a new top tax bracket.   you reduce your taxes with credits and deductions(http://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/personal-income-taxes/tax-deductions.htm).  big idea 1 is: reduce your current taxes(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes) by making less of your income  taxable.

- **debt**.  you borrow money now so you can spend it, yay!  but then you have to pay it back, and typically pay back more than you borrowed, boo!  you've lost money as a result.  the extra amount you repay is determined by the interest rate(http://banking.about.com/od/loans/a/calculate-interest-you-pay.htm); the annual rate is called apr.  
3% apr student loan?  you'll pay $30 annual interest on $1000.  not bad.  
12% apr car loan?  you'll pay $120.  not good.  
  23.9% apr credit card?  you'll pay $239.  yikes!  (never do this!)
you repay the money you borrowed, too; that's called principal.  the longer you take to repay the loan,  the smaller each payment, but the more interest you'll then pay.  it's a tradeoff.  big idea 2 is: reduce the amount of interest you pay(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt) by getting lower interest rates, and avoiding / quickly repaying higher interest debt.

- **investing**.  in eli18, i noted bank interest won't make you rich.  the good news in eli22 is: investments can make you  current millionaire rich(http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/save-million-calculator.aspx).  the catch is: it takes decades, and you must regularly invest significant sums.  this why you start at 22!  the eli22  introduction to investments is based on the target date fund(http://www.finra.org/investors/target-date-funds-find-right-target-you), wherein you buy shares of a mostly stock-based index  fund  designed to be worth a lot more when you retire at a target date 40+ years in the future.  historically, these accounts gain about 6% annually(http://www.thesimpledollar.com/where-does-7-come-from-when-it-comes-to-long-term-stock-returns/) after inflation, though it varies significantly year to year.  your money doubles every 12 years, and goes up by 10x in 40 years.  (all numbers are  after taking inflation into account.)  so that $5000 you put aside at 22 could easily be worth $50,000 of today's dollars at 65.  (but, there could be years where you temporarily lose 10%, 20%, even 30%(http://www.finra.org/investors/reality-investment-risk) of your savings.  do not panic!  it will come back eventually.)  big idea 3 is: invest early and often for your future, especially your retirement.  

got the the big ideas now?   good!  let's see how we combine them for some meaningful benefits for your ~22-year-old self.

- retirement contributions. you are going to retire someday.  invest and perhaps reduce current taxes by letting your employer contribute a percent of each paycheck to your 401k account(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k) (or similar things with different names for government employers).  a recommended investment percentage is 10%, but it's up to you; more is better, the annual maximum is $18,000.  the cardinal rule is take the match(https://www.smart401k.com/resource-center/retirement-investing-basics/company-match) if you have one.  a typical employer adds 3% of your salary when you contribute 6%, so that's like free money.  take the match.  (your actual match depends on your employer's rules.) the  money is invested for you, available penalty-free when you retire after age 59.5 (usually.)  if you change jobs, the money can go  with you.  a 401k can only invest in what your employer offers.   most employers have target date funds, so choosing one is an easy decision.  if you need or want to, you can sometimes achieve an  even better result by picking other available choices.

- ""what do you mean 'perhaps reduce current taxes'?""  retirement savings are wery wery complicated.  (thank your  congresspeople.) a ""traditional"" 401k reduces your current taxes because it exempts your contributions from your taxable income.  you pay taxes when you take the money out, deferring the taxes, but you still pay something.  if you would prefer, you can reverse this if your employer offers a ""roth"" option.  in that case, you pax taxes on your 401k contributions , but no taxes when you take the money out.  the best choice(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) is complex; for those below the 25% bracket, roth is usually better.  

- yet more retirement options: iras.  individual retirement accounts(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras) are do-it-yourself 401ks.  you set up an account with a company like vanguard, schwab or fidelity, and give them up to $5500 annually to invest for you.   you have more investment choices, target date funds plus other options.   depending on your income level and whether you have an employer 401k, you open a traditional or roth ira, with tax treatment equivalent to the previously described 401k types.  iras are your go-to option if you have no employer 401k, but you still may (and even should) want to use an ira, especially a roth ira, even if you have one.  you can  tap ira and  401k resources before retirement for certain allowable reasons, though it's not usually recommended because you lose future gains and might owe current taxes.  a roth ira is the best choice for raidable retirement savings because contributions can be taken out at any time without taxes or penalties.

ok.  that was a lot of information!  ready to repay student loans(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/studentloans)?  let's find out:  

-  if you do have student loans, the interest rate clock is ticking.  loans are typically 10 year repayment, so you'll owe about 1% of the loan balance each month for ten years.   
if you owe $20,000, that's $200/month.  like a car payment.  not terrible.   
if you owe $100,000, that will be $1000/month.  like a mortgage payment, only without the house.  not fun to pay.  
you have to pay these back unless you get them forgiven.  you have several approaches(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans) available for repayment:

- pay them back on schedule.  it sounds crazy, but it just might work!   if your income supports it, pay the minimum on low-interest (<~4%) loans.  if you have even more income, repay them faster with extra payments, especially on higher interest loans,  and save by paying less interest than you would over time.  this is your primary option on private loans.   if you have high-interest private loans, look into refinancing(https://studentloanhero.com/refinance-and-consolidate-student-loans-0042/) them; if you have good income and credit, you'll qualify for lower interest rates.  

- if you have a lot of federal loans but  little income, look into reduced payment plans(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven) like income-based repayment (ibr) and pay-as-you-earn (paye) plans.  you'll pay less (even nothing) each month, based on your current income, but you'll pay longer, and ultimately pay more over time in many cases.  

- if you are really in a deep hole, maybe over $100k federal with only $40k annual income, give a special look into public service loan forgiveness(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) (pslf).  this program allows you to work for ten years in public service, make minimal payments, then your unpaid balance is magically forgiven, which is a really sweet deal if you can get it.  (this differs from forgiveness programs for ibr/paye that will charge you taxes on any amount forgiven in the future.)

enough about  student loans.  let's wrap up with a few other topics of general interest to 22 year olds:

- grad school can be a good idea, but can also be a very expensive idea.  if you are sure this is for you, try to get someone else to pay for it, whether the school via scholarships / stipends, or your employer, if they do education reimbursement.  med school is worth the money no matter who pays.   law school and mba return on investment is iffier these days.  going to grad school because you are not sure what else to do is probably a big mistake, especially so if you have to pay for it.

- you may be responsible for your health insurance(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance).  (you could be on your parents' plan until age 26 in many cases, though that may cost them something.) if your employer will pay for it, that's your best option.  they may offer a lower-premium high deductible health plan(http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/11/10/should-you-roll-the-dice-on-a-high-deductible-health-plan) (hdhp), where you pay routine costs, but insurance kicks in for major expenses.  this is a good choice if you have good health and make few claims.  you  should take advantage of a healthcare savings account(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/what-is-an-hsa/) (hsa) with an hdhp.  this lets you deduct contributions to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses, with  other unique features that make them attractive.  you can contribute $3350 annually to your hsa.  some employers pay some of this for you as more free money.   

- if your employer doesn't offer health insurance and you can't use your parents' plan, you'll want to get an individual plan such as those found on healthcare.gov(http://healthcare.gov).  you can only sign up at certain times, including open enrollment  in november / december.  if you don't have health insurance of some form, you could pay a penalty(https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/) of up to ~$2000 at tax time, unless you have an exemption(https://www.healthcare.gov/health-coverage-exemptions/exemptions-from-the-fee/).  

- with more income, you can rent a nicer place within the same 30% of takehome guideline.  you may not even want a roommate!  of course, any money you spend on housing is money you don't have for other things.  living with your parents is still a viable option if you want to save, e.g. to pay down student loans.   please make sure you have renter's insurance, it's well worth the small cost.   (note that we assume you are not yet ready to buy a house; you may not yet be sure where you  want to live long-term, have limited work history, or have insufficient down payment.) 

- you can also afford a nicer car, since you have better credit, and  lower insurance rates.  (you don't have to upgrade your car, and you'll save money if you don't.)  paying cash is still an option, but if you qualify for a 2% car loan, consider taking it to free your money for purposes like retirement investments and loan repayments.  a good target price is perhaps $15k, with a $10k loan, which works out to 4 years at $220/month.  your total cost-of-car would be about $5k annually.  selling your old car privately should get you 20% more than you would by trading it in to a dealer.  

- with more expenses, budgeting becomes much more important.  you'll want to have a bigger emergency fund; we recommend at least three months' expenses, to cover that bad day when you lose your job and your car breaks.   with more expenses to track, look into a program like you need a budget(https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (ynab) or mint(https://www.mint.com/) to help keep track of where your money is, and where it needs to be in the future.  look for ways to economize where you can, whether by cheaper cell-phone plans, learning to cook so you want to eat at home, or taking advantage of employee discounts.  

- while you don't have a lot of tax deductions yet outside of retirement / hsa savings, take a look at possible tax breaks(http://blogs.hrblock.com/2013/04/08/twenty-somethings-dont-overlook-these-tax-deductions/) for student loan interest, moving expenses associated with a job change, and certain tuition expenses (american opportunity tax credit(https://www.irs.gov/individuals/aotc)).  you don't have to itemize to take advantage of these, but income limits apply in some cases.

"paying attention to my 401k saved my company's employees ~$92,000. this is a post about how even a little bit of attention can go a long way for you, and others. 

i work for a company with ~600 employees across north america. since finding the personal finance communities two years ago, my family has been keeping an eye on our budgeting and saving, and i was having fun with it, so i started also keeping track of contributions into my 401k - nothing major, just a yearly look to see contributions, matches (my company matches 4%), and dividends.

one year i logged into my 401k provider (fidelity) and ran my transaction history total for a year, and what caught my eye was a fee for $12.50. to that date i had never seen a fee before. i called my hr/benefits and they confirmed they had jumped the gun but that - starting next year - every employee would have a $12.50 recordkeeping fee charged yearly. they reimbursed me the $12.50 for that year, but i learned a lesson: 401ks (and the hr departments behind a company) were not infallible.  i added 'fees' to my mental thing to check on during my year-end check.

2 years went by, until this last year. this year in february i pulled the 2018 totals for my 401k, and noticed that my contribution and my year-end total seemed off, by about $150 or so. i couldn't figure it out. finally, i went to the transaction history of my 401k and looked through it. and there i saw it: a company **match** of *negative* $153.95, back in march. it was the strangest thing! it wasn't tied to any actual contribution; it was just sitting out there, all by itself. it wasn't even listed under 'fees'. it was just a *negative* company match. (shout out to everyone who has ever complained about their company match or lack thereof - at least you've never had a *negative* one!) and i knew it wasn't just those dollars i was missing - it was all those dollars that those dollars were going to make, and the dollars *those* dollars would make, for decades to come. 

i started asking around. my hr department said there were no reported problems and that if i wanted a detailed walkthrough of my 401k contributions, i could wait two weeks until i had a meeting with the benefits coordinator. i said, 'schedule it'. but i didn't stop there. i started asking my coworkers, and guess what - *everyone* had a negative company match on that date. i had 5 confirmed cases, then 10, then 20. the amounts all varied, but it was always on the same march date. 

by this point i got enough people riled up that i ended up talking to the head of benefits, who confirmed that, okay, maybe there was a problem. it took 2 months for them to confirm, at which point we found out that a payroll 'true-up' calculation had incorrectly counted a week that crossed from year-to-year as two weeks, and then had automatically 'corrected' for the doubled amount. it took 2 more months for them to finally correct it. i'm sure some of my coworkers contribute less and some contribute way more, but 600 employees * $153.95 = $92,370.  meaning that every person in the company had a hand in some $92000 missing from their 401k... but i was the only one who had bothered to check. 

i know most people don't ever calculate out their paycheck or look at their 401k. and i'm not saying you should on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. but every once in a while, take 5 or 10 minutes and grab that paper copy of your paycheck, or hit that 'forgot password' button, log on to your system, and take a little look over how much money you're getting - be it paycheck, 401k, or whatever - and see whether it makes sense to you. you might be surprised what you find.

"be prepared if you're resigning or quitting, have been fired, or are being laid off: a pf checklist. there's a long list of things you need to worry about when separating from your job regardless of how or why that is happening.  it is often an emotional time, but missing a few key steps could be troublesome down the road. (https://www.someecards.com/usercards/viewcard/leaving-my-job-without-the-going-away-party--aa5a7/)

this checklist is intended to apply for most situations including: resigning or quitting a job, being fired from a job, or being laid off.  navigating the end of a contract as a contractor is not really the focus of this post, but some steps may still apply.

some specifics will only apply to the us (e.g., retirement account types, filing for unemployment, health care).  if you're aware of a guide for any other countries, please make a comment!

## before resigning *or* if you are at risk of being let go/laid off

- it hopefully goes without saying, but you should already have a firm job offer in hand before resigning (unless you have a different plan like heading back to school).  likewise, if you are at risk of being let go or laid off, you should be building your network at the very least (if not outright looking for a new position).
- do you have a retirement plan with your employer (e.g., 401(k), 403(b), 457, simple ira, sep ira, or tsp)?
  - note that many employers will require to to pay off any outstanding loans you have made against your retirement plan.  if that's the case, you will have only 60 days after separation to pay off the balance to avoid early distribution taxes and penalties.
  - plan out what you'll do with your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement account.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/retirementaccounts/rollovers)
  - recognize that you will be giving up any unvested matching for your retirement plan.
- have a plan for the first few months after the job.
  - figure out what you'll do for health insurance (sign up for your own via cobra or the aca, switch to a spouse's plan, or wait to get coverage with new employer).
  - consider whether you will want to convert your group life insurance policy to an individual policy.
  - make sure you have enough money to carry you into your next job without dipping into your emergency fund, set up a budget, and examine your general financial situation.  emergency funds are for unexpected circumstances.
  - if you are planning on moving, understand that landlords often want to see proof of a job and income - which may make getting a new place more difficult.
- make copies of any performance reviews, professional certifications, or other personal documents that you'll want to keep as well as your current vacation balance, salary information, etc. having a copy of your contract and benefit information on a personal computer is also recommended as you might not have access to them in the future.
- however, do not take copies of any work performed without written approval from management.  this is not your property and is equivalent to stealing.
- backup (commonly by emailing a copy to your personal email or copying to a thumb drive) and remove all personal files from your work computer, work phone, and any other device.
- be prepared for what you'll do or say if your manager makes a counteroffer.  many people say it's a bad idea to stay after attempting to resign, but it can also go well.
- don't give more than two weeks of notice if leaving immediately and not being paid for your remaining time would be a financial hardship.
- if you received stock options, received a hiring bonus, or receive ongoing monetary bonuses or rsus:
  - examine your vesting schedule and consider whether you may have to return any bonus money (e.g. hiring bonus, moving stipend, education assistance) before you decide when to quit.
  - don't expect to collect options, rsus, or bonuses during your notice period because you might be terminated immediately. it's better to wait to give notice until after any important vesting dates (you should still give two weeks).
  - purchase any stock options that are ""in the money"".
- check on your benefits and find out what happens to them upon leaving.
  - do you get your outstanding vacation days paid out or do you lose them (meaning you should take them before resigning if possible)?
  - when does your health/dental/vision insurance expire?  end of the month or day you leave?  make sure any appointments are scheduled with this in mind.
  - if you have floating holidays, you may want to take them before resigning.
  - if you have an fsa, is there anything left in it to spend down (check out fsa eligible items on amazon). anything left the day you leave, the company keeps. even if you are resigning on jan 15 and only contributed once, you can still spend the entire annual amount and not have to pay it back.

- put together an email list of anyone you want to email (individually or as a group) when you leave.  don't email too large of a group because it's tacky and use bcc: for group emails.
  - email should be short and to the point. something like it was great working with you, i learned a lot.  here's my personal info to keep in touch.  don't try to explain yourself.

## how to resign

- don't burn any bridges and maintain a professional attitude. you never know who you will run into again in the future, keep it professional.
- bring a box with you (leave it in your car if you can't bring it in discreetly) to allow for easy packing of any personal possessions in case you are walked out that day.
- make sure you have contact information for any key people - coworkers, managers - that you want to keep in contact with or possible use as a reference in the future.  send a copy of this to your personal email.
- do not tell your coworkers/friends prior to telling your boss and hr.  this is not something that you want floating around the office.
- tell your manager in person and present a short and professional resignation letter to him or her at this meeting.  when you leave the meeting, email a copy to them and hr (even if it is from home later that day).
  - don't make it personal or give a reason.  state the facts.  ""i am resigning position effective date."" you don't owe them a reason (especially in written form), don't try to provide a list of things they could fix, etc.
  - if you want to elaborate with your manager in person, keep the discussion positive and brief.
- give two weeks notice and finish strong, but don't be surprised if you get walked out the day you resign or even immediately after resigning.
- if you do end up working the notice period - you still need to work!  this is what you will be remembered for, don't start slacking off. work with your manager to finish or hand off all projects you are currently working.
- once you do leave, if something was left behind, make arrangements to pick it up. talk to hr about this if needed.
- send any goodbye email later from a personal email account.  don't ""spam"" aliases for an entire company or large departments unless it is a very small number of people (under 20 people).

## what to do after you are laid off or fired

- don't burn any bridges and maintain a professional attitude. you never know who you will run into again in the future, keep it professional.
- try to keep a calm appearance until you are off property.  this is an emotional time, but you don't want to be remembered as the person who cussed out everyone as they were dragged out by security.
- make sure you have contact information for both your manager and hr representative in case of questions later.
- try your best to pack any essential personal possessions that day if you get walked out, check for small things like cell phone chargers and pictures. it can be awkward returning later.
  - if you do need to return for personal items or any other reason, make arrangements in advance, don't just show up and expect to be let back in.
- you may be asked to sign a legal document giving up certain rights (e.g., a non-compete clause or waiving certain rights to sue) in exchange for severance pay and/or other benefits.  note that non-compete clauses are very difficult to enforce in some states.  you absolutely need to read the entire document before signing and it's your decision to make.  consult an attorney if you need help.
- send any goodbye emails later from a personal email account.  don't ""spam"" aliases for an entire company or large departments unless it is a very small number of people (under 20 people). do not send anything right away because your emotions will be running high.

## after leaving

- if you were laid off or fired, apply for unemployment(https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-file-for-unemployment-benefits-online-2064123) as soon as you can assuming you were not fired for misconduct (i.e., terminated for cause)(https://www.thebalance.com/can-i-collect-unemployment-if-i-am-fired-2064150). the entire process can take weeks so do this as soon as possible.
- any life insurance coverage through your employer will terminate after you leave (sometimes immediately, sometimes at the end of the month).  consider converting your group life insurance policy to an individual policy, especially if others depend on your income or if you have medical conditions that may prevent you from getting an individual policy on your own. the cost tends to be low, but you will only have a limited amount of time to do this (usually 30 days or until the end of the current month, but don't count on that).
- move your 401(k) or other employee-sponsored retirement account to your new plan or a rollover ira (if that was your plan).
- get on linkedin and link up with the ex-coworkers who would say good things about you (and vice versa).
- get health insurance if needed (see above).  there's a 60-day grace period after leaving your job for cobra election (you can get coverage retroactively), but signing up for aca coverage may be less expensive.
- make sure you have a plan for how you will sell any company stock.
- inform your new employer about how much you've already contributed to your 401(k) for this calendar year to avoid exceeding the contribution limit.  note that you may have another paycheck or two still coming from your old employer after you quit so it may take a little time to figure this number out.

## being unemployed

unless you have a signed job offer in hand, it's time to actually *act* like you are unemployed.

- hoard cash.  don't waste money on stuff you don't need to survive.  review your budget, cut any and all unnecessary expenses, stop eating out and going out to bars for drinks.
- you have extra time so use it to save money: cook at home, exercise on the cheap, read books from libraries instead of buying them.
- your ""job"" is now finding a new job.  
  - update your resume (get some feedback on /r/resumes), customize it to each job, and submit it everywhere.  
  - spend time every day on job search sites, linkedin, and communicating with your network.  set a weekly goal to send customized applications and resumes to a specific number of jobs per week (e.g., 20 jobs).

"we decided not to buy a bearded dragon.. my wife and i were looking at getting a bearded dragon for our son for his birthday. a young beardie is only about $60. so we set aside $200 in our budget counting on buying a reptile aquarium and some incidentals. 

then we learned it needs expensive uv bulbs that last about 6 months and are about $40 each. also the electricity cost the run this heat 24 hours can be a drain on the electric bill. 

also the beardie needs to go to the vet every 6 months for a checkup. and finally, food. they have a very diverse diet and can eat up to $15 per week in foods. so i did a total cost analysis for a beardie that lives 12 years and it turned out to be a whopping $10,000 

life pro tip, do a total cost analysis on pets before deciding to purchase. even free pets are absurdly expensive. in 12 years both of my kids are going to be in college and i will desperately need $10,000 then. i will not need an aging lizard.

edit: for everyone giving me shit about my poor son, don't pity him. first he didn't know about the beardie. second we are taking that $200 and taking him to an amusement park. he's fine. 

edit 2: this post is not about ""don't buy pets, they're expensive."" the post is about ""make sure you're aware of the full cost of something before making a decision."" yes we have kids and dogs. yes they're more expensive than lizards, but for us well worth the cost. a reptile, not so much. 

edit 3: thank you all for the ""you're way overestimating"" and the ""you're way underestimating"" posts. the accuracy of the cost really isn't the issue. the issue is we were expecting something minimal and almost made a big mistake. the point is, we did the research and it was way more than we were expecting and wanting to pay. to us, it wasn't worth it. we have other pets. we aren't frugal, but we are smart with our money. i am simply encouraging others to do cost analysis. and at the end of the day if a bearded dragon is worth 10k to you, awesome! do it.

"i have to move out at 18, what do i do?. i won't bring up the specific details, but long story short, my parents are legitimately crazy, one of those extreme situations where everything i do must be kept secret (talking to friends, working a normal job, etc).

luckily in the middle of last year i got a job with my brother, he told my parents he would not pay me, then paid me in secret. since then i have about 10k saved up, but recently they have made it very difficult to even work because i am assuming they somehow figured out i am being paid. because of this, i will likely lose my job and my income, however, i do have experience working with people, writing resumes, doing interviews, so i don't think getting another job will be super difficult. the main issue for me is how can i get out of this house as quickly as possible? for a while i thought that maybe these things my parents do were normal, but the more i am exposed to the real world (mostly through the internet, which i had very little access to until about 2 years ago) i found out these things are in fact extreme and unusual.

for a bit more context, i am 17, no car, no license (parents won't let me get one), no friends who would be willing to let me live with them (socializing was very hard because i was homeschooled) i have a associate's degree and as i said, 10k saved up. whats my best course of action to get away?

"180 days later, bank of america is refusing to refund over $700 in fraudulent charges made in texas while we were 800 miles away in illinois.. back in july we were wrapping up our yearly road trip to illinois. we purchased gas around 8 or 9am right before we started the 12 hour trip to texas.

&#x200b;

two hours into the trip my wife gets a notification on her phone from bank of america alerting her to fruadulent charges being made. we only have one debit cad.

&#x200b;

while we were starting our driving home, someone in austin, tx purchased around $500 in merch at home depot, drove towards houston, tx attempting twice to use our card at the atm, which did not work because they didnt have the pin. they made their $200-ish last transaction at tj maxx north of houston before were alerted and had the card shut off. (austin to houston is about a 3 hour car ride)

my wife immedately makes a claim. 10 days later, we get the money credited back while they continue the investigation which seems pretty open and shut to me... they also say it may be another 45 days before they finish their investigation.

october 5, they send a letter stating that they have completed their investigation: ""our records show the transaction activity in question was authorized for and posted to your account."" the letter states they'll be taking the $740 back on october 22.

wife calls and has them reopen the case or escalate it. we're told it could be another 45 days.

jan 3. wife calls them again. this agent states that while an escalation sends an email to their investigators notifying that we are still asking about they case, they are under no obligation to complete it.

&#x200b;

after reading a bit into the law surrounding this, we have realized we can request the documentation they used to close the investigation.

&#x200b;

what else can we do? do we need a lawyer? if they had to reimburse us for the first 45 days of the investigation, why do they not have to temporarily reimburse us as they continue to investigate ""for as long as they need"" with no date set for resolution on our end?

&#x200b;

it is blatantly obvious that someone skimmed the card at some point and had a dummy one made. are they able to continue to withhold our $750 indefinitely and just keep saying. ""nope! looks good!"" until we tire out?

&#x200b;

our kiddos missed out on a lot of christmas gifts because of this and now bills are starting to get a bit tight. we really need this money back. thanks yall!

**update:** started posting on social media before i start filing complaints. 20 minutes later bank of america contacted me on twitter. will update later. thanks for everyone's advice.

**update 2: 3 hours later...** i continued to post on social media, reaching out to local news stations on twitter that have community protection or investigative segments and linking to this post. bank of america has now reached out in one of these posts, referencing my wifes name. fingers crossed.  http://imgur.com/gallery/i4gwtc0(http://imgur.com/gallery/i4gwtc0)

**update 3:** wife got home 30 min after my last update. a rep with boa actually called her asking what was going on. the rep said she would need to call the fraud department and get them all on the line together. we are at our kids practice so opted for them to call us when they have someone on the line who can help us. will update later.

**update 4:** just got off the phone with someone in the fraud department at bank of america. i recorded the whole convo and will be uploading it to youtube. she says the call on oct 22 did in fact reopen the case. (even though the rep on dec 22 said otherwise and the rep earlier today said they have no timeline to adhere to and can take as long as they want)

they now have 60 business days from oct 22 to finish the claim once again.

she says one of the reasons that the claim was denied was because the didnt attempt to drain her account. (they hit up two atms and failed to use the pin to drain the account, so they don't even have the correct info to base their findings off)

i requested documentation about the claim as law allows and she says i should get that in 10 business days. they now have until jan 18 to notify us of their findings. i'm going to continue with filing reports and posting on social media.

i'll update in a few weeks i guess.

**update 5: 10 hours later,** they have blocked me on facebook for sharing my problems on their page. i also filed a complaint with the cfpb .

**update 6:** 24 hours since this post and david, a bank of america employee in the ""regulatory complaints department"" left my wife a voice mail  in regards to a complaint sent to them by the cfpb. they close at 4pm est. (they're closed by the time we got the voice mail since she is at work). will update monday.

**update 7:** wife woke up this morning and the money has been returned to our account. time to turn and burn!

thank you everyone for your advice. we learned a lot from this.

**update 8: we got confirmation that the fraud claim is now closed and the money that was returned is permanent. waiting on an actual paper letter to come in the mail before we turn and run. thanks everyone! update here:** **https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/adnjj7/update\_bank\_of\_america\_refusing\_to\_return\_700\_in/**(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/adnjj7/update_bank_of_america_refusing_to_return_700_in/)",10
"successfully negotiated a 45% raise in salary, thanks pf!. i recently decided i wanted to move on from my job for a variety of reasons. one of the main reasons was i felt i was undervalued. so with a lot of research here is how i went from $58,000 to $85,000.

1. i felt i was undervalued, so i needed to prove it. 
2. i needed another job, obviously.
3. i needed to know how to negotiate.
4. i needed to make sure i knew my bottom line and what i really wanted.
5. making the decision.

so lets start with number 1. **am i undervalued?**

i needed to research how much my job title was worth. for this i went to the bureau of labor statistics, salary.com, glassdoor.com, and google.  http://www.bls.gov/ooh/ has nearly ever piece of info you need to decide what your position is worth.  salary.com and glassdoor.com also where close to bls.  don't settle on one source for anything. 

do realize when doing this part that you need to take into consideration the local job market in your area.  where i live for example, i know my area pays less than the median because my cost of living is alot lower than most other places.  so when you decide what the median pay is for what you do, be realistic. for me the median pay was $70,000.  my current job was paying me $58,000.  so number one was finished, i am being undervalued.

on to number 2. **find another job**

i needed to find other places of employment in my area, doing what i wanted to do.  for this i went to the google, as it has all the answers.  i made profiles on careerbuilder, indeed, glassdoor, and monster.  i updated my resume, and started applying for everything i thought i would want to do.  

it is important to realize when applying for jobs it is time consuming and will get frustrating repeating your self over and over.  but you need to stay diligent. also it is worth your time to tweak your resume to match key words in the application you are applying for.  

i wish i would have known the importance of networking as well.  sometimes the best opportunities are ones you get by someone mentioning your name to the right person.  never burn bridges and always reach out to those who may be able to vouch for you.

anyway, i applied for a week straight. then slowly the calls and emails started rolling in. hell yes!

by the end of the week i had 3 interviews setup. i was amazed on just how easy it could be to get the process started.  then the hard part came. interviewing.

my interviews went awesome.  i researched what to say and how to say it, how to accent my strengths, and all that jazz. the best piece of advice on how to interview well is read! google is your best friend.  for me the best things were my drive to succeed and my willingness to learn.  many employers will pick people who are driven over people with alot of experience.  obviously you need to have some skills, but don't underestimate the power of persistence.

employer a gave me a range for the job pretty easily when i asked about it.  this makes your negotiating power much higher as most of you know. but the range was way to low.  i knew already this place was out.  but i thanked them for the interview anyway. sometimes you just are to far apart to waste each others time any further.  be polite though if this happens and move on.

employer b wanted to know how much i wanted for a salary.  i thought ""oh yea i know not to say anything, i am so clever!""  well they didn't budge.  the wouldn't give me a range, and they kept at me.  sometimes this will happen.  handle it accordingly.  i gave them a high range 75k-85k.  they seemed ok with it.

employer c was the same way as employer b. i handled it the same.

number 3. **negotiation**

so i received 3 offers in 2 weeks.  wait, you got offers at all 3 places? hell yes i did! one offer was lower than i wanted, so employer a was out. be sure to thank everyone for there time and offers.  remember... don't burn bridges.

but the other 2 offers where above the median income i researched!  this further made me realize i'm definitely worth more than i'm making now. employer b was at $82,000. employer c was at $75,000.  it was almost surreal for me to hear these numbers.  this validated my thoughts and research of being undervalued even further.

there is a myriad of things to negotiate. don't just think about salary, but the overall package. this article helped me alot when preparing.  http://www.careerempowering.com/interview-power/negotiating-the-best-salary.html  don't be afraid to tell people what you want.  but don't go overboard.  no one is going to pay you 1,000,000 a year to clean toilets.

now that i have these offers i can leverage one against the other.  this works the best when you know a company really wants you. i spoke with both companies back and forth and i knew employer b was the winner. damn this is crazy! 58k to 82k in 2 weeks. 

i go to my current boss and tell him whats happening.  i was upfront and honest about everything, that's usually the best way to go. then my current employer decides to counter offer. $85,000.  what the hell do i do now? my brain is on overload.

through much reading and researching i found that counter offers are generally a bad idea to accept.  i mean i wanted to leave anyway, that hasn't changed.  so i took the counter offer and spoke with the other employer b about it.  they decide to match the salary and i negotiate more days off.  is this really happening? 85k

number 4. **knowing what you really want, and what you bottom line is**

the offer of $85,000 was above and beyond my bottom line.  the overall package of benefits matched my expectations.  the job is what i wanted to do.  you need to know this stuff going in and be able to walk away when someone does meet your bottom line. staying strong and not budging on this bottom line is essential.  

finally 5. **making the decision**

the hardest part of all this stuff is making an actual decision. i'm going from $58,000 to $85,000 in either decision i make. i'm on the winning side either way.  try and take your emotions out of it, and look at the facts.  for me i decided to take the new opportunity and take the plunge into the unknown.  do not second guess yourself. 

i realize my situation may not be average.  getting a 45% raise probably isn't typical. but the fact remains that it is possible to negotiate a better lifestyle. it is nerve racking, intense, anxiety inducing, and difficult.  but it is all worth it in the end. i hope this helps at least one person in their pursuit of a better life.  thanks pf for all the help and courage to tackle the unknown.",10
"bank of america is refusing to give back $9,800 to my dad's account after someone fraudulently stole his funds.. on the night of november 1st/early morning of november 2nd, someone made 8 separate withdrawals of $600 each(total $4800) at atm machines in tarrytown, white plains, and lower manhattan from my dad's account and then phone transferred another $5000 from his savings account to his checking account. then the thief made three purchases at target with a debit card, charging $1000, $2000, and $2000 respectively. the total amount that was taken out of my father's account was $9,800.

when he checked his email on november 4th, my father immediately called bank of america and notified them of the fraud and filed two claims (one for the saving and one for the checking accounts).

after waiting several business days for the result of the investigation, my father called bofa to check on the status of the claim and was told the claims could not be paid because they did not see any errors on their part with their system! they reopened the claim but then closed it again several days later.
i don't understand how the bank can deny responsibility. my dad has never told anyone the pin number for his debit card(not even members of his own family). when you put money in a bank, it is suppose to be safe and now he feels violated because not only was this money stolen from him, but now they are trying to say that they are not at fault.

he was informed by a bofa associate that someone had called in requesting a new debit card on oct. 27, 2016, but he did not make a call to bofa on that date. i don't understand why the bank would allow this unusual activity to go through, or how they could let a thief phone transfer his money between his savings and checking accounts! also, how can the bank authorize a new debit card to be mailed and what exactly is required for this request to be granted? he did not make the call to request a new debit card! where are the security checks in place for any of this?
my father filed a police report and the detectives assured him at that time that the bank would return the cash. they said that as long as the fraud is reported within 60 days, the bank has an obligation to return the funds.

the last time he spoke with a bofa manager in a local branch, they actually reassured him that he would be getting his money back and that the process just takes time.

but this is the letter that my father received from bofa today:

we've completed our investigation of your above referenced claim and based on our findings, we're unable to honor the claim
because the transfer was made to an account that you own and the funds were made available to you for personal use, used to
pay an obligation owed by you, or both. as a result, we're respectfully denying your claim.

• we based our decision on our records and the information you provided when you contacted us about your account.if you
have additional information pertaining to the transaction(s), please contact us at the toll-free number listed below.
• you may request copies of the documents used in our investigation and we'll mail the information to you for your records.

fraud and claims


at this point, what should he be doing? contacting the local news? getting a lawyer and suing bofa? i asked him to mail a certified letter with return receipt to bofa so that there is a paper trail of all of this.

according to the ftc, he should be fully covered.
https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/…/0213-lost-or-stolen-credit-a…


edit:  thank you all for your replies and comments.  i will do research into what federal agencies to file complaint at and i will keep everyone updated on any additional details.  in the meantime, i will try to answer some of the questions that were posed:

1) the thief called bofa and requested a new atm/debit card on october 27th and it was mailed to my parent's home address.  i believe that whoever called bofa to request the card also stole it from the mail.  my mom's account at bofa was not compromised but my parents were very upset and did not want to take any chances, so they requested replacement cards for both their accounts (their accounts are not linked) after the incident. 
bofa mailed my dad's debit/atm card and pin on separate days as requested, but my mom's new debit/atm card and pin still arrived in the mail on the same day.  i am guessing that this is how the thief was able to get ahold of the card/pin.  

2) a lot of people are asking why the withdrawal limit was so high.  my dad received a letter in the mail a few days after the fraud occurred letting them know that their withdrawal limit was increased to $2400.  apparently, the thief called in and requested to increase the daily limit.  they then made 4x$600 withdrawals right before midnight on november 1st, and 4x$600 withdrawals in the early morning of november 2nd.  by the time my dad got the notice that his withdrawal limit had been increased, his money was already long gone.

3) i have no idea why the thief had to do a phone transfer to move the remaining 5k from the savings account to the checking account.  i would think that you could do a transfer right at the atm. i think there should be a recording of all of these various phone transactions and bofa frankly does not care to look into them.  they also don't care to look at the videos from the atms.  

edit#2: update
great news!  bank of america has returned the money to my dad's bank account.  he received an email to log into his bofa account to check some new messages.  after he logged in, he saw that his funds had been returned and the messages stated that his subsequent follow up claims had been approved.

the next step is to find out from bofa and exactly what information the perpetrator had that allowed them to request a new debit card from bofa to be mailed to my dad's address.  i saw a lot of comments that asked why my dad didn't file a police report, but he did!  i realize that the first post was a huge block of text, but i did mention that he filed a police report. it's just buried in that text.  a lot of people also mentioned that it might be someone close to him such a a family member, but this is pretty much impossible.  my mom and dad immigrated to the us over 30 years ago, so we actually don't have any other family members here, as the rest of the extended family is overseas.  i'm their only child and i live on the west coast while they still live in ny.  i also doubt that they fell into bad company because they are some of the most straight laced boring people you'll ever meet, lol.  they don't drink, gamble, smoke, etc. in any case, the next step is definitely to figure out how this happened in the first place. hopefully bofa will be able to provide us more information in that regards.",10
"saying: ""i don't want to save, i want to live life and have fun while i'm young"" is just an excuse that makes you feel better about your bad spending habits.. i see this over and over in my family and friends and ironically in r/personalfinance. "" i want to live my life, not save every penny"", that sort of thing. 

**it is possible to save while still doings fun things, eating nice meals and traveling.** when someone makes it a this-or-that situation i think they are making excuses for poor spending habits or budgeting. sometimes deferring gratification leads to the ability to have more fun and freedom once you've established yourself financially. i'm not talking about waiting till retirement btw, im talking about getting a budget setup, getting some investments going, getting some interest coming in, paying off debt that costs you interest etc. interest is money you could be using for fun, that you instead are paying to some huge corporation. what i'm describing isn't some kind of punishment, it's a way to be more intentional and to always make sure the things you are spending on are helping you attain your goals and add lasting fulfillment to your life. it's the ability to buy things at their actual cost because you can get a decent interest rate. 

i don't make insane amounts of money, but i'm careful and try not to buy things i don't need. i always ask how many times a year i will use something before buying it. i think about how small amounts add up to be a big amount over time. my family mocks me saying things like "" he still has his first $1."" basically saying i'm cheap. they all buy whatever they want when they want it. they are in debt, stuck in life and unfulfilled by the very items keeping them there. once you get on the roller coaster of spending on credit cards for instant gratification, it can be very hard to get off.

i'm not saying this in a judgemental way, i've just seen so many people i care about struggle financially because of this mindset. i've seen it limit their ability to see the world and follow their dreams. seeing it being perpetuated in a place designed to help people get their shit together is kind of brutal to watch. 

if you are a young person coming here for advice, this is the best advice i can give: briefly defer your gratification. half the time the thing you ""must have"" seems pointless if you just sit on it for a week. avoid impulses and focus on experiences and items that will last and wear well over time. once you have established a solid financial foundation, your ability to go places and do things will quickly outpace the friends and family around you that are focused on attaining every minor impulse and paying off the associated debts.



**tl:dr you can be financially together and still have a fun!**

well, this is a stark reminder that pensions are not bulletproof.  yes, all investing is some form of gambling, but with 401ks and iras it's at least your money, which you control and can withdraw as needed.  i am *not* saying that pensions are inherently bad and that no one should ever use one.  they are a great cushion to your other assets.  but please, please, please: do not skip other forms of investing because you think you're going to be set for life in retirement thanks to a company pension plan.",10

this was my whole letter.
i was told it was unprofessional by his assistant and that i should have called my boss to talk to him about leaving before submitting a formal notice so he knew why and what my plans are.
my mother works in the same company and she was contacted before me by the assistant to see what my plans are and why i want to quit. (i'm in my mid 20s living on the other side of the country as her and we talk sparsely, there's no precedent for her being questioned in my mind.) i was told he'd be contacting me soon, i gave up trying to contact him because he never responds.

i sent this late last month and i haven't heard anything from him whatsoever.

my new job is giving me a sign on bonus and doubling my annual salary so there's no chance i will be staying here at all. i want to know what you guys think and if there's something i should do that i may not know to do. thanks.


edit: 
- role, not roll. i goofed.
- i didn't actually use my reddit name in this letter 
- i work in a high specialty field in a high position. they won't be able to hire someone off the street, thus the reason for the long notice.
- boss was not contacted before hand because he has not responded to me for over a month prior. weeks-months at a time without response before that.

"things i wish i'd done in my 20's. i was thinking this morning about habits i developed a bit later than i should have, even when i knew i should have been doing them. these are a few things i thought i'd share and interested if others who are out of their 20s now have anything additional to add.

edit 1: this is not a everyone must follow this list, but rather one philosophy and how i look back on things.

edit 2: i had no idea this musing would blow up like this. i'm at work now but will do my best to respond to all the questions/comments i can later today. 


1. take full advantage of 401k match. when i first started my career i didn't always do this. i wasn't making a lot of money and prioritized fun over free money. honestly i could have had just as much fun and made some better financial choices elsewhere, like not leasing a car.
2. invest in a roth ira. once i did start putting money into a 401k i was often going past the match amount and not funding a roth instead. if i could go back that's what i'd do. i'm not in a place where i max out my 401k and my with and i both max out roth iras.
3. don't get new cars. i was originally going to say don't lease as that's what i did but a better rule is no new cars. one exception here is if you are fully funding your retirement and just make a boatload of money and choose to treat yourself in this way go for it. i still think it's better to get a 2 year old car than a new one even then but i'll try not to get too preachy.
4. buy cars you can afford with cash. i've decided that for me i now buy cars cash and don't finance them, but i understand why some people prefer to take out very low interest loans on cars. if you are going to take a loan make sure you have the full amount in cash and invest it at a higher rate of return, if it's just sitting in a bank account you are losing money. we've been conditioned for years that we all deserve shiny new things. we don't deserve them these are wants not needs.



those are my big ones. i was good with a lot of other stuff. i've never carried a balance on a credit card. i always paid my bills on time. i had an emergency fund saved up quite early in my career. the items above are where i look back and see easy room for improvement that now at 37 would have paid off quite well for me with little to no real impact on my lifestyle back then aside from driving around less fancy cars.",10
"negotiated a 17k raise after ~ 2 1/2 years of stagnation. feels great!. in july of 2014 i accepted a healthcare it position for a well known hospital. at the time, i had only 2 years of experience in the field and was fairly green. since then i have learned an overwhelming amount through my various assigned projects and my skillset has improved dramatically. after lurking in this sub for several months, i became increasingly agitated by my employer's inability to revisit my initial salary, which i know was considerably lower than my coworkers. coming to the conclusion that my salary would never increase without action from myself, i summoned the courage to talk to my boss. i demonstrated clear examples of how well i had adapted to the unique challenges of the job. it didn't take very long before he stopped me and said ""you don't have to say anymore. your work has been tremendous lately and we need to reappraise your salary."" 

unfortunately it took five gruelingly long months to get the last bit of approval needed through the awful bureaucracy that is my employer's hr, but i just received the news yesterday that it had been fully approved. effective in 3 weeks, i'll be making $82,000 from $65,000, and staying with the same employer.  i can't wait to up the percentage on my 401(k) and start putting more away each month. i'm still buzzing, and i'll always be a loyal follower of this sub!

"surprise $2,700 medical bill from a ""surgical assistant"" i didn't even know was at my surgery.. so about 3 weeks ago i had a hernia repair done. after meeting with the surgeon, speaking with the scheduler and my insurance, i was told that my surgery was going to be completely paid for by the insurance, as i had already met my deductible and my company's insurance is pretty good.

a couple of weeks after the surgery, everything got billed out and just like i was told, i owed nothing. however, a couple of days ago i saw that a new claim popped up and that i owed $2,702 for a service i didn't know what it was. i checked my mail and there was a letter from american surgical professionals saying that it was determined that surgical assistant services were necessary to the procedure. the letter also said that as a ""courtesy"" to me they bill my insurance carrier first, and surprise, they said they weren't paying, so i have to incur all costs. i was never aware of any of this, nobody told me this could happen and i was completely out and had 0 control over what was going on during my surgery. 

why is this a thing? isn't this completely illegal? is there any way i can fight this? i appreciate any help.

edit: forgot to mention, the surgery was done at an in-network hospital with an in-network surgeon.

edit2: since i've seen many people asking, this happened in texas.

edit4: i want to thank everyone who has commented on this thread with very helpful information. next week, i will get in touch with my insurance and i will call the hospital and the surgeon as well. i will also send letters to all three parties concerned and will fight this as hard as i can. i will post an update once everything gets resolved. whichever way it gets resolved...

i did this not only to ensure i was getting my maximum refund, but to also see which was the superior service, as i had seen all 3 recommended frequently throughout the sub.  as someone who is completely new to filing their own taxes, freetaxusa was by far the most enjoyable all around experience (as enjoyable as doing your taxes can be, at least.) i would recommend to anyone here that plans to file their taxes themselves to use their service. and yes, i realize everyone's tax situation is different so the ""best"" service is slightly subjective. this was just my experience! 

 it was far and away the cheapest option for my situation, as it actually honored the free filing option for federal and only cost $12.95 for state filing (10% discount if you enter freetaxusa10 in the promo code section at the the end). h&r and turbotax both shot up to between $80-$100 total cost to file my federal and state returns once i entered in my 1098e, 1099-misc, 1099-int and div etc. they also hounded me to upgrade to an even more expensive service throughout literally the entire process. 

freetaxusa walked me through the process very efficiently and painlessly. they went through every possible type of income, credit and deduction i could have.  and most importantly (for me at least), they were true to their word of being a free service. they didn't steadily increase the price as i entered more information and they didn't try to get me to buy additional products and services i didn't need. hope this helps anyone else out there new to the process, without a doubt will be using them again next year! 

edit: someone asked if there was a difference in the amount of my refund (should've included that in the original post, sorry!). but, for federal, no. they all came out exactly the same. for state, yes. freetaxusa found an additional $33 on my state refund that h&r and turbotax did not find. 

edit 2: as mentioned by another user, if you go through ebates you can get an additional 25% off the state fee and it should be stackable with the 10% off promo code. however, i did not try this personally. was unaware at the time!  and some states give the option to file for free through the state. i did not find where my state offers this service, however. 

edit 3: i have seen a few people say they were able to get the free service through turbotax and my post may be a little unintentionally misleading in that regard. yes, i did go through the free file portal with turbotax like i did with the other services. however, once i began entering my income information, that is when i was disqualified from the free service and i was automatically placed into a paid service. turbotax does offer free filing, but only if you make less than 34k a year or are a military member that makes less than 66k a year, and i'm neither! sorry if i mislead anyone! 

also, it makes a difference in price with h&r and turbotax if you have a 1098e/1098t, self employment/contract labor income, savings account interest, an hsa, investment income etc., and freetaxusa doesn't charge for entering these forms. some of these things do apply to my 2018 tax situation, which is likely a major reason it was so much more expensive to file with  h&r and turbotax. as i said in the post, everyone's tax situation is slightly different and i'm not trying to promote certain products over others! just wanted to provide my personal experience! 

final edit (hopefully): a lot of people are under the assumption that you have to wait until the 28th to file, but that is not the case. if you have all of your documents you can file earlier. the irs may even accept your return early to use while they test out their system. i completed mine yesterday and actually got an email from freetaxusa a few minutes ago stating that my refund had been accepted by the irs and i would be getting my refund within 21 days. 

much requested tl:dr: for my tax situation, which included several sources of income, i would recommend freetaxusa. the interface is very user friendly, the cost of my service remained free and did not increase as i entered more information, i was not pestered to upgrade into a more expensive service throughout the process and i was able to get an additional discount on my state filing cost. 
 

*there are a few people that have said this is some sort of ad.*

*full disclaimer: i have no affiliation with any of these websites and this is not an ad. i'm just a frequent redditor trying to help out other fellow redditors! i work for state government, but based off how many people think this is an ad- maybe my future is in marketing! lol. may also have to do with the ""scammy"" name of the company... i have to admit, i was a little skeptical when i first saw it!*",10
"i found ~$5k in savings making totally non-life altering changes. i've been wanting to write this for a while. a while back i hated my job. i was working 80 hour weeks and getting paid doo-doo for the effort. in response i wrote up an ""escape plan"". it included a bunch of ways for me to replace my income, but it also included a ton of ways to save money without changing the quality of my life. 

i spent hours and hours making this thing, so that i'd have a plan to follow. good news, i got out of that hell hole, more good news, the money-saving piece is relevant to almost everyone so i figured i'd share all the ways i found that can help you save a crap ton of money without really having to change your life. 

so without further adieu. 
     

* **change your car insurance:** car insurance companies make most of their money on old clients. once you get past a certain age, they creep your rates up ever so slowly. they are willing to discount your insurance when you switch.

so we shopped around, found the lowest quote and saved a crap ton on the discount they were giving us. this was an easy one-time change that affects my life 0. 

**before:** $196/month 
**after:** $116/month
**annual savings:** $960

     
      
* **threaten your internet provider:** every internet provider offers promotional rates for your first year, then hike your bill after your first year. i've never had a problem giving someone a call and telling them that i want to move to another service because they are offering a promotion. every time they offer me their promotional rate. this is a once a year phone call that saves you a decent chunk of change. 

**before:**$69.00(lol)
**after:** $45.00
**annual savings:** $288

this won't work if there is only one provider servicing your area. sorry comcast slaves. 

     

* **switch your phone plan to mint mobile, or red pocket.** these are services that piggyback off of major mobile phone network providers at stupid discounts. 2 lines on mint is something like $15 a month. it's stupid how cheap these lines can be. their service is quite good as well.

**before:** $180/month 
**after:** $30/month
**total annual savings:** $1800
     

* **use a few credit cards like a debit card:**. if you're in the middle of crawling out of cc debt this is particularly bad advice. but if you are basically debt free, and can responsibly use your credit card like a debit card; paying it off as you go, you can save a bunch of money. basically, every expense besides my mortgage goes through a credit card so i can reap those sweet sweet rewards. 

between 3 cards i get rewards that include:

5% on gas

3% on dining out

2% on grocery stores and costco

1.5% on everything else. 

essentially these are discounts on everything. 

**before:** $0
**after:** +$30/month
**annual savings:** $720
  

these savings are based on expenses between my fiance and me.
     

* **oil change coupons:** i refuse to be a coupon lady. partly because of my y chromosome, but also because the time it takes to effectively coupon is not worth it to me. i'd rather do anything else. but oil change coupons are very easy. you have to get your oil changed at least once a quarter, and googling a coupon for it works 100% of the time. you should never pay full price for an oil change. 
  
i'm sure some of you are also saying *but foofy, you could save more by changing your own oil*. to that i say *sure, but i don't want to change anything in my life and the hourly savings is like $5. printing a coupon is easier*

**before:** $70/quarter
**after**: $50/quarter
**annual savings:** $80

not a lot, but seriously this one is so easy. 

     
* **buy a smart thermostat:** i wasted a ton of money by heating an entire house for the sake of my pets. they are going to sleep in a sunbeam no matter the temperature so there's lots of savings to be had here. you could just remember to turn down the heat/air everytime you leave the house, but that would require me to change way too much about my habbits. instead, a smart thermostat. hard to give you the ""before"" on this one but here we go:


**before:** ??
**monthly savings:** $13.5/month
**annual savings:** $135

      
* **utilize an hsa**. for those that don't know an hsa is a ""health spending account"". the way it works is you put money into it directly from your bank account, and all of that money is tax free. it's basically a free 25% money back on health expenses depending on your tax bracket. i grow moles like it's my job, and in order to avoid dying of skin cancer i have to get them removed constantly, this tacks up my health bill may be a little higher than most but still, here's the savings i had, yours will likely be more or less: 

i can hear it now, ""but my employer doesn't offer an hsa"", you can actually contribute to an hsa without your employer(https://20somethingfinance.com/contribute-to-hsa-outside-of-employer-payroll-deduction/)


**before:** $2000
**after:** $1500
**annual savings:** $500

here's an hsa savings calculator(https://www.wageworks.com/employees/support-center/hsa-savings-calculator/) if you want to figure out what you can/should contribute.

        

* **cancel your unusedgym membership:** if you don't have one, well then you can't do this one. if you have one and you consistently use it, well then don't cancel it. that said, gyms expect only 18% of people to consistently use thier facilities(https://www.creditdonkey.com/gym-membership-statistics.html) so there's a good chance that many of you (like myself) can cancel their membership without affecting their life. the 3x a year you convince yourself you're going to get in shape you can just go run outside instead. 

**before:** $20
**after:** $0
**annual savings:** $240

        
alright, that's all the easy stuff you can do without changing your life. **the grand total for us came out to $4,723.** just shy of the $5k i promised. to be fair i did put a ""~"" in front of it. 

       
not everyone one of these is going to be applicable to every person but i hope you were able to find a few nuggets in here that could save you some money. 





edit: someone noted my wonky math that cc rewards didn't add up. i forgot to double the amount with my fiance which doesn't perfectly work but is not far off. keep in mind that $1500 in expenses each going through only our 1.5% cc would yield $22.5 each. not including all the optimizing we can do. she has 3% on online shopping too so $60/month between the two of us in rewards is not that far out of the realm of possibility.

"i'm a 20f college student who just got guardianship of my 12 year old sibling. help!. long story short: my mother is a raging alcoholic and after cps and law enforcement being involved (and the father being out of the picture), i'm now the guardian of my younger sister.

i have no idea what to do.

i work full-time in a food service job making $10 per hour not including tips, which brings it to around $11-$14 per hour depending on the day.

i bring home between $1,700 and $2,000 per month. (depending on tips)

i just signed a lease for a 2br apartment at $900 per month. it is literally the cheapest option i could find that was in a safe area and not too far of a commute to work (around 11 miles).

my current expenses are: $160 for a personal loan, $40 for cell phone, $180 for car insurance, $80 credit card. per month. 

i honestly don't know what to do. her child support is coming to me now, so that gives me an extra $400 per month.

she doesn't have health insurance and hasn't been in school for almost a year now. since i am her guardian can i add him to my own health insurance as a dependent?

i figured posting here would be most helpful because as a college student i have no idea how to budget for a child. tuition isn't an issue because it's fully covered by grants.

how do i plan this? what are my options? i don't even know where to start...

edit: also there are no other adults to help. i am the oldest sibling and my father is also out of the picture. no aunts/uncles/etc. my grandma lives on the other side of the country but is sending a little bit of money to help but nothing else more than that..",10
"how to get a live person at the irs (pretty easy). i'm an accountant and i pass this on to all my customers about how to get someone live on the phone at the irs:

call 1-800-829-1040

press 1 to confirm english if you speak english.

when you get past choosing a language, in the first menu of prompts, press 2.

when it gets to the next menu with prompts, press 1. 

when it gets to the next menu with prompts, press 3. 

when it gets to the next menu with prompts, press 2. 

the next menu will ask you to enter your ssn, it will then ask you to confirm you entered a ssn, then it will read back the number and ask you to confirm that it is the right number. 

after this, it will take you to a menu with a bunch more options. ignore them all, let the computer talk itself out and when you don't enter any more numbers, you'll be entered in a hold line for a live person! i recommend calling on wednesdays or thursdays as they seem to be the least busy, and don't call around lunch time.

mainly made this post after seeing a post with a lot of comments from people having trouble reaching the irs and a live person. hope this helps!

"i bought a used car last night, and if you're new to buying used, please read this so you don't fall into the traps.. i love the car buying process. it's fun, i take my time, test drive cars, find what i like and try to find a good deal on a 2-4 year old car. 

car salesmen are not the ones you need to fear. many of them are great, and work long hard honest hours to push some cars. as my dad told me before he dropped me off to buy my first used car, ""when they get you in the back room, that's when they're going to try to screw you.""

if you think that's a joke or an understatement, please accept the fact that it is neither. when you sit down in the chair in the finance office, you need to be as alert as a deer in hunting season. here's how they tried to get me, and i hope i can help one person not get taken. 

-when i sat down, the finance manager had already opted in on my behalf for every single add-on available. i mean, all of them. they do this every time, and all they need is one final signature, not individually to keep them on. it had an extended warranty, gap coverage, alarm system, electronics warranty, and a couple others i'll never remember. it was 10:30 at night when i finally got out of there and was exhausted. 

two things to know:
1) you are not obligated to any of them, no matter what they say. when i had crappy credit, i was almost convinced when they told me the finance company required gap insurance. don't believe the nonsense. 

2)apparently, after my experience last night, they are not required by any means to explain to you what you're buying. unless the finance manager i used broke several laws, after an hour of him explaining ""every detail"" there was still an extended warranty for a whopping $3,000 that he barely even alluded to! when i finally said, ""what's this warranty you keep saying is included?"" i knew the car was under manufacturer's warranty for a short time still, i thought he was talking about that. nope. i literally had to ask specifically, ""what am i paying for that?"" without me asking that very specific question, he had no intention of mentioning the price. the car still had 13k miles on the warranty, and they wanted to sell me a new one...

-you do not have to buy the $1,000-$1,500 alarm system/insurance plan they will almost cry rather than remove. this was the longest part of the process as i waited twenty minutes while they fought me the entire way, using every trick in the book. don't buy it, don't let them win. finally, they left it on and didn't charge me.

**with all that being said. there are some that you can drastically change the price of and get a good value on something that matters. they offered a dent/scratch repair on the body and wheels for five years for $895. i spent over $1,000 over the last four years on my last car from my car being hit while parked at work, so i offered them $300 and they took it. it's something i know with no deductible i can get great value out of. 

what's difference? the difference between the number i walked in that room to and the one i left with was $150 a month... (edit: meaning, i left with $150 lower monthly payment after stripping everything to the bone)

agree or disagree with anyone of this, but if i can help one person not get taken, this twenty minutes was worth it. 

good luck out there!

"i have worked at my current job less than a year, but i just recieved another offer for $13k greater salary and better benefits. i currently make $52k, and got a job offer for $65k for a ""senior"" role in my field. the benefits are all better too, with a much better 401k match. i've only worked at my current position for 10 months though, so i'm not sure leaving so soon would be a good thing. is it bad to jump jobs so frequently? would it look bad on my resume?

"i raised my credit score from 546 to 720 in 4 months thanks to you guys.. hello everyone, first let me say thank you. it is thanks to you that i finally, for the first time in my life, have control of my finances and can breath easier. i wanted to share my story in the hopes that someone else who was in a similar situation as me, might benefit from my experience. i will briefly describe how i raised my transunion and equifax scores from the 540s to the 720s in 4 months. something that i did not think was possible. and it was all thanks to...

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5lgh97/i_raised_my_credit_score_by_73_points_in_3_months/


that subreddit. seriously. i followed the advice in there to the letter, and it worked like magic. here'es a bullet pointed version of exactly what i did: 

•	downloaded credit karma – saw that my score was 546 on jan 15th (was crushed, but felt like i was finally going to start taking control)

•	got my full credit report and list of all accounts that had gone delinquent and/or into collections.

•	called every. single. one. first i disputed every account, and over half (50%) of them could not prove that the accounts were real and/or could not prove that they followed the law pertaining to the fair credit act, and removed the accounts from my credit report.

•	in 30 days my score had gone from 546 to 620! i was elated, and more determined than ever. i felt like i was on a mission at this point. 

•	i applied for and was approved for a capital one secured credit card. it works like this – when your credit is so horrible that you cant get a real credit card to start boosting your credit, you get a secured card. basically, you pay them $200 for a credit card with a $200 limit.. i put $40 on the card every month, and paid it off completely.
 
•	i paid off all of my credit card debt.

•	of the delinquent and/or accounts that i had in collections that were not removed, i negotiated the debt down at every single one. i called them and basically said, ""i don't have enough money to pay my full debt, but i will give you x amount right now, (usually about half of what the debt was) to settle it and remove it from my report. they all had to get their manager's approval, but every single one of these  debt collectors accepted my offers. the way they look at it is like this – ""we either get half, or nothing"" 

•	after 60 days i was up in the 680s… couldn't be happier. then i did something that was not mentioned in the above subreddit..

•	i signed up for a service that sends out letters written on your behalf demanding that they show proof and accuracy of the negative item on your credit report. basically, you pay them a certain amount per month, and they send out attorney written letters to all credit reporting agencies, and debtors on your file, demanding that they prove they followed the law to the letter, and demand that if they cannot, then the record must be erased from my credit report. it's basically a team of attornies and paralegals that work on behalf of their clients to remove delinquent and collections accounts from their credit reports. 

•	less than half of the remaining collections could prove that they followed the process, so they removed the collections from my account. 

•	i then paid off the remaining 2 accounts (down from 17 accounts when i started this)

•	my credit score as of yesterday from both transunion and equifax is now 723. 

•	i applied for a real credit card from chase and was immediately approved for a credit card. 

and that's my story! 
tl;dr – call all your debtors, negotiate the debts down. get credit karma, be religious about not going over 30% of credit card limit, get a secured credit card.

again, thank you everyone on here who helped make this possible, i really wouldn't have been able to do it without you, and i mean that. thank you. 


edit: one huge thing i forgot to mention... i called into my auto loan company and asked them to remove some late payments that were on my report. i had about 4 late payments that were 30+ days, and 2 that were 60+ days. i asked them to remove some, and they did. overnight my credit score went up 22 points. 

edit 2: wow. thanks everyone for the response. i have received many messages from people who we're in a similar experience as i was when i started this journey. thank you so much for your comments and your messages. there are a couple of things i wanted to clear up however.


some people have perceived this guide as ""not ethical"" in the way i removed accounts from my credit report. 

i don't care. you don't have to follow my advice i'm just sharing what i did, and it worked for me. i hold no moral obligation to pay third party debt collectors mountains of money with their fees tacked in. i just played the game and i won. simple as that. you don't have to agree with how i did it, i just wanted to share what i did.

"another example for why having an emergency fund is 1000x better than having more/nicer things. my wife and i are in our early/mid twenties. we have saved a little more than a third of our income over the past two years so we had several thousand dollars in an emergency fund plus extra savings. the amount isn't really relevant - the point is that we had no plans to use it. 

at the end of 2016 we were both in great health, and being young we decided to go with my employer's hdh plan with an hsa. last weekend we blew through the deductible on my wife and we will likely hit the out of pocket maximum before the month is over. this health issue came out of nowhere and we're very fortunate to have good insurance. 

but because we have extra savings, we don't have to make medical decisions based on cost. we can pay the full annual out of pocket maximum and we won't really miss it. if a doctor thinks a test is necessary we can simply authorize it without worrying about how we will pay for it. it has been stressful but i can't imagine how much more stressful it would be if we had to go into medical debt to pay for it all. 

we could have eaten out more last year. my wife could drive a nicer car. we could live in a bigger apartment or house. but i wouldn't trade the freedom of having the extra savings for any of that. 

this came out of nowhere and was frankly highly unlikely. it could happen to anyone.  and we were easily able to pay for it. an emergency fund is psychologically, emotionally, physically, and financially is the most important improvement to your quality of life that you can ""buy."" in my opinion anyway. 

edit: thanks to all for your well wishes and support. to those who took this as a criticism of spending, please know that this was not my intention. my wife and i are not ultra frugal - we simply prioritize our spending where we think it will have the greatest impact on our lives. in my view, an emergency fund is just another thing you ""buy."" i feel that, of all the things anyone could buy, it is the one that will have the greatest impact on your quality of life.",10
"got a performance rating of exceeds expectations. my boss requested a significant salary adjustment and i was denied and given the standard 2.5%. should i quit my job?. i was originally promoted within my company to create a new department about 1.5 years ago. i've since worked my ass off and spent the last year doing managerial level work for non-managerial pay ($47k). 

i initially accepted this offer as it was in line with my experience at the time but i've now shown that my capabilities go far beyond what was originally expected of me. my market value is between $60-75k based on the title i *should* have. 

my boss agreed with this and requested a large pay bump prior to my review. he was denied and told i'd receive the standard 2.5% that everyone else got and could renegotiate in 6 months. 

the problem with this is that i was told the same thing the last time i requested a raise and it was never followed up. 

i've set up a meeting to ask what specific goals and milestones are in place for this 6 month period. 

are they saying to renegotiate in 6 months because raises were already budgeted for review time, or are they just trying to pay me as little as possible. 

worth noting that i love my job - i self manage with hardly any supervision as i chat with my boss every friday about what's going on. should i just leave now or wait until i discuss why my salary adjustment was denied with the ceo?

edit: i don't plan to quit without receiving an offer from another company - just asking if it's worth negotiating with my current employer or if i should just take more money somewhere else. 

edit 2: holy hell i only expected to get 5-10 responses. thanks everyone for the help!

current plan is to discuss why this happened and to also shop around for other jobs. probably won't use an offer as leverage although i've seen others here do so successfully. cheers, all. ",10
"get familiar with your utility bills and pay attention to trends - they can save you tens of thousands of dollars!. like a lot of people every month i get a water bill, electricity bill, internet, you get the idea. most months i open my mail, verify that the bill looks roughly similar to last month and let autopay take care of the rest. 

but since last year i have started an excel spreadsheet documenting what my bills are each month, how many thousands of gallons of water i'm using, kwh used, the whole shebang, in an attempt to be a more financially responsible and understand where my money is going and how i can save.

the last 3 months i noticed my water bill hiking up. my home uses between 2-4k of freshwater monthly but it's gone from 5, to 8, then 8 again. i noticed the trend, but didn't really understand why it increased - i'm not a plumber and there were no leaks in the house i was sure.

fast forward to last evening and i'm out with a group of acquaintances and someone's plumbing problem gets brought up, one of my friends is an awesome plumber and i manage to ask him at the tail end of the conversation about what i noticed on my bill. he seemed immediately alarmed and asked him if i noticed any water accumulation in my front yard. actually, yeah, it's been raining a lot lately but i do have a few persistent pockets left over on my yard. how did he know? this morning he actually brought his crew out to my house and found out there's a crack in my water main - i was losing hundreds of gallons a day and it was on the verge of rupturing completely. he replaced the line for a nominal fee and said how glad he was i said something - my area is really prone to sinkholes and nothing attracts them like pooling or leaking water. i likely saved tens of thousands of dollars in damage to my house and my neighbors house by bringing it up! not to mention the savings in my monthly bill...",10

also, lots of people pming me about having bad credit themselves. look loads of landlords rent to folks with less than perfect credit / criminal history / landlord history / income. honestly i suspect most do. the ones i've worked for definitely do. the folks that almost no one will rent to are the ones who force an eviction immediately after moving in, never intended to pay once they got tenants rights and trash the house on the way out and do this repeatedly. i promise they're out there. tons of folks do this shit. i get we have a housing crisis but its just insane to think we solve this by having every person who has property to rent play craps with their kids college fund or their retirement savings.

also, i get it losers. the proletariat is going to rape my eye holes while i watch my family bleed out. you don't need to keep messaging me that. i've already gotten the message. i suspect you're the same assholes out there trashing houses, destroying people's nest egg / retirement funds / kids college funds / lives.

"google charged me $299.99 for 30tb storage that i did not authorize and now they won't refund my money. i received a notification from paypal at 10:21pm et that a $299.99 charge was made on my wife's google play account. the payment was for 30tb storage for 1 month. my wife's account is only using 7gb (and google offers 15gb free) so it does not make sense that we would want 30tb of storage!  we did not authorize this charge and nobody in my house made this purchase.  kids are sleeping and wife was taking a shower at the time.  i called google immediately and they refused to refund the money saying it happened ""inside the account"" so basically accusing us that we did it.  no suggestions to change our passwords and that it might be an unauthorized charge from a different computer. no information as to which ip address the charge came from was provided. they said to contact paypal to open a dispute if i want. google has canceled the storage account so it is no longer active. i'm not sure what to do but this seems like a very unfair policy from google. any suggestions?

update: i called again this morning and spoke to another representative ""michael"" who was a lot more empathetic and helpful. they submitted the return request again and said it should be approved this time. also a redditor who works for google reached out to me here on reddit and is checking on the case for me from the inside. hopefully i can get this resolved via refund and can close that paypal dispute, since we don't want to lose my wife's account if at all possible. thanks for the support everyone.

update2: success! http://imgur.com/u4yvl6q after talking to the second google representative this morning, and most likely with help from an anon googler who contacted me via reddit pm, they have refunded my money! i have closed the paypal dispute and just waiting for the refund to ""clear"" (currently it is in pending status). i told the second call center rep this morning the exact same thing, we don't know who made this purchase. also i did not mention this reddit post. he was super professional, empathetic and took care of me. even his email was reassuring, he said ""don't worry about it, we will take care of this!""...

lessons learned: 

- be persistent! the first call center rep might give you a hard time but calling back validates or tests their stated policy and in my case it proved that they could in fact help me if they wanted to.

- don't leave credit cards or paypal pre-authorized payment methods connected for years on end. from now on i'll be disconnecting these payment methods as soon as they are used. it's not that hard to retype a credit card or paypal credentials.

- use 2 factor authentication! although there is a possibility this could have been done accidentally in my house by my son (he still hasn't fessed up) this has been an exercise in learning where our security gaps are and making sure we're not too naive when it comes to account protection.

"i've owned the apple card for 3 months, this is why it sucks compared to other credit cards. 1% cashback when using the physical card is absolutely dismal. 2% back on apple pay is limiting and most cards offer between 1.5% and 2% cashback (ie citi doublecash). you'll get that flat cash back regardless of apple pay or not. the 3% back on select stores is okay but honestly is beat by any revolving category cards. most cards now allow you to access your rewards cash as soon as the transaction posts. 

you literally can't even add an authorized user to this card. what kind of 1980s bullshit is this.

the biggest downside of this card is that it will not integrate with any budgeting applications. absolutely ridiculous there isn't out of the box support for mint. considering apple does not have any banking products, this means that users are not getting a holistic view of their finances. in fact, i found it easy to forget exactly how much i was spending on the card because it didn't integrate with mint.


you can pay your bill in two ways, on your phone or by mail. i don't know any credit card provider that is so archaic you can not pay via a web portal.

they also aren't reporting to the credit bureaus right now, although that's slated to change.

"i kept a detailed record of how much was spent to have our baby. here it is.. almost three years ago my wife and i had our first kid. i kept track of everything that we spent money on that was kid related. starting from the pregnancy test to the hospital delivery bill. we also estimated the value of any gift we received to give a full ~~itemized bill~~ idea of how much money was spent on our kid before she was even born. i made an ugly spreadsheet to track it all. i thought about posting this here when i was all done but decided not to because a, i just had a kid and was busy, and 2 i wasn't ready for the criticism i was inevitably going to receive. but, now i am ready and less busy, so here we go. 

starting with the big number:  
to bring our baby into the world from scratch cost $9,984.55.  
my wife and i spent $6445.66.  
we estimated receiving $3,538.89 in gifts.  

i broke everything down into these categories:

category |cost
---|---
gear | $1,661.02
diapers ect. | $119.90
baby clothes | $294.54
mom clothes | $804.30
medical | $4,170.05
books | $248.78
toys | $275.93
bedroom | $2,305.53
feeding | $161.21

in anticipation of some shock on all this spending i'll add that we bought things that we felt would be useful to our lifestyle, within our budget, and that would last for many years to come. we could have spent less, and many people do, and many people actually go well beyond.

**the most expensive things were:**  
the hospital trip to safely have a baby ($3517 delivery related bills combined)  
*-having a baby fall out of a woman in a hospital in america is expensive. this was after insurance covered their portion.*  
a crib + mattress that converts to a toddler bed and full size bed ($890 total - gift)  
*-kid is almost 3 and we converted the crib to the toddler bed shortly after she turned 2. she wasn't a chewer, so it's currently in great shape to stay her bed until her teens or beyond.*  
mom clothes ($804.30)  
*-after seeing this final number i told myself i shouldn't ever gain too much weight because i now know how much a new wardrobe could end up costing me. we were at a point in life where most of the items were bought new and that was ok. 
a new glider chair ($500 - gift)  
*-i wish we could have found this used but didn't have any luck. we wanted one with a high back because i'm tall. i'm thankful we found one, i spent so many nights rocking and dozing in and out of sleep on this thing, i'm very happy with it. we still use it nightly for reading bedtime stories.*    
the stroller ($384)  
*-we got one of those fancy bob running strollers, i ran over a hundred miles with her and we walked plenty of unpaved trails at our local state park. she spent hundreds of hours in this thing. this was the only stroller we used, otherwise we carried her everywhere in the front/back carrier. plus these strollers have a high resale value.*  
car seat + extra base ($375)  
*-we have two cars, a base for each car was great.*  
two camera video baby monitor ($250)  
*-we did a lot of traveling and having the extra camera to just pack and go was really handy. a video monitor is the shit, being able to check and see if a noise was just stirring or something more was great.*  
a cute rug ($239)  
*-a cheap rug would have served the same purpose, but shit it's our first kid, sometimes you gotta get that cute thing.*

writing this with the benefit of hind sight i think we actually did a great job of getting the right thing for us on the first try. we tried to get things with the idea of potentially having another child. of everything major that we bought, the monitor is the only thing we would need to replace if another kid sauntered into our lives. the battery is now totally useless and one of the cameras died last month. also we dropped it, so the power cord is soldiered to the chip and i'm awful at soldiering so it whole housing is glued together to keep it working. 

so can you do this cheaper? absolutely, buy everything used. babies aren't all that picky. i lived in rural illinois at the time and our availability to get nice used stuff was limited. also hand-me-downs can help tremendously, our extended family had kids eight years or more years before us (if they had any) and lived many states away so most of their baby stuff was gone. also, don't underestimate the generosity of others, there are people out there who love babies and love buying baby things, hopefully you know one or two.

another money saving tidbit, use cloth diapers. back when i was weighing the benefits of them, i found we would break even with cloth over disposable at two years. our kid suddenly decided to be potty trained right before christmas so our cloth diapers lasted a bit over 2.5 years, we definitely saved money with cloth. if we accidentally have another kid we will save a ton in diapers because the original ones we got are still in great shape. also, you can find used cloth diapers around which can save tons, we hope to sell ours. a very appreciable downside to cloth, you're guaranteed to be washing the diapers about 2-4 times per week.

a shout out to /r/predaddit for all the helpful tips and stories that were so great at the time. also /u/steeldirigible98 & /u/savingsjada and the several updoots for the courage to finally post this on this sub. i hope this info helps someone out there.",10
"irs says i owe them money, there's a warrant for my arrest, and i should not hang up the phone. i did.. so i just got a call from the ""irs crime"" division regarding tax fraud from 3 random years. they said i owed nearly $4,000 and that i better not hang up the phone or the police would knock on my door within 30 minutes with a warrant for my arrest. they said if i hung up the phone, it would flag their system as me being unwilling to cooperate and legal action, including my arrest, would be put in motion..

"best advice my dad has ever given to me: (1) if you can't afford the monthly payments to pay off your car in 3 years, you can't afford that car. (2) after the car is paid off, continue paying your car payment into a savings account.. by the time you pay off the car, you've budgeted the car payment into your finances.  make it a direct transfer so that you don't give yourself the option to skip a payment.  my car has been paid off for 3 years and i have saved over $12,000 almost effortlessly by using this method. 

edit: this seems to be striking a nerve for many.  this post was written with the intention of helping those who wouldn't invest the difference with a longer loan.  it was meant to offer a simplified idea for saving that worked for me to work for others.   as with everything, there are always better ways to save and invest.  this was just the one that helped me out.  with that said, i've learned a lot by your comments, so thanks for posting!",10

update#3  might be the last for a bit.  1st: (serious)  what's the best way to use the 3 golds i got,?  not really sure what to do with them?  can i give them away? 

2nd: so i am leaving saturday night to start a career as a truck driver.  my reasons for picking this are varied :  paid training, paid housing (sort of) and the ability to make a little better than average wage once training is complete, which will take several months.  i'm also doing this because i can immerse myself in the work ethic and commitment which i believe will really pay off psychologically. 

you've all been so kind and helpful.  i really can't tell you how much this has meant to me.  i think i would have remained kind of paralyzed if not for your help and guidance.  pls keep the good vibes, thoughts and prayers coming my way, i'll definitely need them.  i will update when i can.  bless you all.

"reminder: you can negotiate your hospital/medical bills down, even if you have insurance. i knocked 30% off my bill for an in-home sleep study with just two phone calls.. *tl;dr even if you have insurance, you can negotiate your hospital bill down a significant percentage. i was successful in getting 30% off my latest bill. thanks, obama.*

i've been futzing with sleep apea for several years (gg gaining 15 pounds in college) and recently decided to ask my primary-care doctor for a referral for a sleep study.

he went through a brief questionnaire with me that ruled out narcolepsy, and boom -- i was scheduled to conduct an in-home sleep study using a machine the hospital provided me. sounded great -- if the test was positive, i'd get a cpap machine free of charge!

what i didn't realize is that the 15 minute appointment to meet with a nurse, who walked me through how to use the machine, would cost exactly $500 after insurance \(hospital/physician services\)(https://imgur.com/a/drgzo). i was barely 10% into my individual annual deductible of $500, so this was going to hurt a lot.

thanks to a post from this person(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5auqdd/reminder_that_you_can_negotiate_your_medical/?st=j95v53cf&sh=3912f619), i decided to call my insurer to get my explanation of benefits explained (eob). once i was satisfied that they were dotting their i's and crossing their t's, i called my hospital to plead my case.

1. my s/o and i are not poor. we are in fact quite privileged and live a comfortable life in the greatest city in america. thanks to good budgeting and a healthy emergency fund, yes we could afford this $500 bill, but it would not be fun. we just welcomed our firstborn child into the world a few weeks ago, and recently purchased a home to boot. 
2. our insurance is actually decent. $500 individual deductible, $1000 family deductible. 100% coverage after either threshold is met. premiums are manageable. 
3. i was stupid and assumed that just because i wasn't meeting with an m.d. in person, i wouldn't be paying more than $100 in hospital/physician services. nope, a neurologist still reviews my test results! duh!

all right, so it's time to call the hospital and plead my case. i dialed the number, entered my account info, and....

**as soon as i explained my situation to the helpful rep from my hospital's financial services department (newborn baby, did not expect such a high bill for a test that i elected to take), i was immediately offered a 30% discount on my $500 bill**. 

i didn't even have to tell them, ""i am only willing to pay $_______"". i was literally quoted an updated figure and told to pay over the phone with a credit card or checking account.

i immediately paid it and thanked the rep for being so helpful. could i have pled for a 50% discount? maybe. but again, my s/o and i have money set aside for unexpected/careless expenditures like this. i should have known better, and i felt it was appropriate to pay at least the majority of my bill.

as for whether i'll be going back for a follow-up test to get my cpap machine.....yeah, we'll see about that.

edit: i should have mentioned earlier, but yes this is a massive ymmv situation. ",10
"psa: it's that time of year again. if ""the irs"" calls you demanding money, it's not the irs.. here is a partial list from the irs of known, common scams:

https://www.irs.gov/uac/tax-scams-consumer-alerts

>note that the irs will never: 1) call to demand immediate payment, nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill; 2) demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe; 3) require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card; 4) ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone; or 5) threaten to bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.

the irs also offers these tips(https://www.irs.gov/uac/irs-urges-public-to-stay-alert-for-scam-phone-calls) on how to recognize, avoid, and report tax scammers.

##if you get called by a scammer, consider collecting their stated name, phone number they are calling from, and number you are directed to call and reporting it to tigta(https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml) and/or the federal trade commission(https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/gettingstarted?nextqid=216&selected=t%20-%20crnt#crnt) (with ""irs telephone scam"" in the notes).  do not give out any personal information.

i highly recommend that those of us with elderly parents or family members share the word.  the elderly are some of the most vulnerable when it comes to online or telephone scams.

"3 tricks car salesmen use to take your money. how to overcome 3 tricks car salesmen use to take your money.  

 
purchasing a vehicle from a dealership can be an anxiety inducing experience.  what i discovered was that the number one emotion women felt when considering buying a vehicle was anxiety followed by uncertainty.  in this article we will review 3 tricks that dealers and car salesman use that cause this anxiety and uncertainty.  i will teach you how to overcome these feelings, and become immune to the tricks. 

 the worst thing that can happen to us as consumers is purchasing something and quickly regretting it.  this is called buyer's remorse and it is a terrible feeling.  why? well you just spent $20,000 and you are married to a monthly payment for 3-6 years. i do not want this happen to you!  the following tips are designed to prevent you from being pushed around by the salesman and to ease your mind of worries in regards to overpaying.
 
#1 ~ emotional manipulation

during my car salesman days, we were taught many subliminal tactics to get customers interested in vehicles.  one is emotional manipulation.  the reason salesmen often insist on test driving is to get you to create a sense of ownership in your mind.  ""ma'am take a seat, adjust the mirrors, now adjust the seat until you are comfortable .  go ahead and turn on your favorite radio station and flip back the sunroof.""  is your heart beating faster and you excitement increasing?  you are unknowingly getting excited and your mind is taking mental ownership of this nice new vehicle.  that awesome new car smell isn't helping either is it?  that feeling of euphoria is a very human response.  they are counting on you to feel this way. 

what happens next is quite primitive.  as our excitement builds, the emotional part of our brains begins to take over. when this happens, we are much more likely to make a choice based on emotions.  have you ever heard of dogs that go crazy and get scared during lightning and thunder storms?  i had an adorable shizu dog that would run miles away when thunder rumbled the house. rip bootsy.  during these storms the logical part of his brain would turn off and the emotional part would take over.  in this case fear dictated my dog's behaviors.  much like my old boy bootsy (my mom named him btw), this happens to us when we take mental ownership of a new car.  the budget we set and the price we wanted are now more likely to be negotiable.      

**how to overcome trick #1 ""emotional manipulation""**

be mindful of your emotions.  simply being aware of this tactic beforehand and how our mind/bodies will respond is a half of the battle in not making a poor emotional based decision.  i always recommend that we sleep on it.  my rule of thumb is to never make a large purchase the same day.  this isn't the same as picking up a snickers while in the checkout line. this is a 5 figure purchase that we will be married to for the next 3-6  years. be smart, go home, sleep, and revisit it the next day when your mind has had a chance to tend to other matters.   
 
#2 ~ pushing you towards payments

after the test drive we will be directed to go inside, sit down, fill out our contact information, and discuss the price.  car salesmen are taught to negotiate the payment with us instead of the price of the vehicle.  this has two benefits for them.  1) making an affordable payment is relatable and gets your mind off of the actual price.  we end up paying more this way. (see ex1 at the end for a math based scenario) 2) the interest rate and the length of the loan can quickly fall into the background with this payment focused presentation.  the payments method works because we are more likely to digest the affordability of a a monthly payments versus the 5 figure sticker price.  over six years, a $100 dollar increase is not that much, but by doing the math it will add on $6k to the total price - wow, that's mind-blowing!  see below how customer 1 saved $4,200 by focusing on a $70 lower payment.  this is worth repeating...a $70 monthly difference saved $4,200!!! 




**how to overcome #2 ""pushing you towards payments""**

tell the salesman up front ""i am not interested in going over payments right now, let's stick to the price of the car out the door.""  you must be proactive here.  a skilled salesman may even give you a rebuttal of ""well ma'am, i just want to make sure you get something that is affordable and fits your budget"".  just smile at your new adversary and politely say ""while i appreciate your concern, i have all of that figured out, please just get me the out the door price"".  (make eye contact and smile for added value and enjoyment). they will get the picture.  you want the individual price of the car and that is what you want to negotiate.  you have now become a formidable opponent.  you have now indirectly saved yourself hundreds if not thousands of dollars by directing the negotiations down this road.  (see ex1 at the bottom for a math based scenario on why this works)   also, the out the door price is the price of the car plus all of the fees that the dealer adds on.  better to know sooner than later what fluff fees the dealers will add.   

#3 ~ the finance office

after a price has been agreed upon, we are sent into the finance office.  here you meet the finance manager.  this person finishes your paperwork, gets you financed (or takes your check), and offers you products to protect your new vehicle.  this is where even the toughest buyers lose.  why? they lose because their guard is down.  when we agree upon a price, we get a handshake and a congratulations.  usually the sales manager gets in on this as well.   you give out a big sigh of relief.  in my sales days, i will never forget this one customer who was an excellent negotiator. he knew what he was doing and worked us down to a super low profit.  he clearly was prepared and this resulted in the dealership making around $100 on the car (nice job!). what happened next really opened my eyes.  he ended up paying $4500 on the warranty and gap products as well as accepting an interest rate 2% higher than he should have. (explanation of these products below in example 3)  all of the money he had just spent his energy and time saving was washed away in the finance office.  customers let their guard down when a price has been reached with the salesman.  don't let this happen to you.  being aware of yourself and the situation is half the battle.
  
i want you to know the background of the finance managers and how they get that job.  it's not by going to business school and majoring in finance.  they get there because at some point they were the top car salesman in the dealership selling 20+ cars a month.  that is part of the car sales business ladder.  it takes a different set of skills since they are selling an intangible product.  you can't put your hands on a warranty or an interest rate. therefore it takes a higher degree of sales skills to be successful here.  they are the best at what they do and that is why they get paid the big bucks. 

the first move when we enter the finance office is to make us feel comfortable.  let's nott let his smile and firm handshake fool us.  he has one clear goal.  convince us to buy what he has.  he doesn't make as much money otherwise.  he will once again show us the new payments if we were to purchase products a, b, or c.  they make money in 2 ways.  the first is by increasing the interest rate we are charged.  they borrow your loan money from bank a for 3% and charge you 4%.  the dealership gets a part of that and the finance manager gets around $500 per % point he charges us.  see ex 2 to see how a 1% increase can cost you well over $500.   the second way they make money is by selling us the company warranty or gap products which can vary drastically. 
 
**how to overcome #3 ""the finance office""**

as before, we want to ask for the total price of the product we are interested in.  it really is a personal preference whether you want any of these or not. i personally have and never will get any of them even if they do add free oil changes.  don't let my stance deter you though because there are some amazing packages out there that add free oil changes for years.  be ready to pay a little extra than you would normally though.  the convenience is worth it for some.  (see example 3 below for more information on products and how to get the best deals.)  next if not already done, we want to clarify what the interest rate is. 
 
good luck!  i hope that this information will allow you to walk into a dealership with confidence.  i hope this was helpful for you and will aid you in saving hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on your next purchase.   
 
 
**example1**

 we are purchasing a $25,000 car.  let's say we go in wanting to pay $22,000. 
the salesman comes out and says you can choose from a payment of $460 or $391. ""which one works better for you sir?""  do you see what he did there?  he changed your $3000 price reduction to a payment and asked you a question directing you to pick from his two options.  many people lose here. they say they like one of the payments and lose or they say they negotiate and say they want to be at $350 a month.  the salesman takes your $350 request to his sales manager, they come back at $360 (they always come back higher).  great. car is sold.  let's do the math though.  you wanted to be at $22,000.  by accepting $360 you just paid $23,000 for that vehicle and you have no idea what the interest rate is.  the lesson here: keep things simple and stick to the vehicle price first.  when that is settled then work on payments. 
 
**example 2**

a $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 4% ~ you will pay $25,920 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
a $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 3% ~ you will pay $25,200 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
that is a difference of $720
know your local credit union or banks rates before you finance a vehicle. 
 
**example 3**

be familiar with the products before you go into the finance office.

extended warranty: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/04/extended-warranties-for-cars-are-an-expensive-game/index.htm
 
the $4500 example above was many years ago. competition in the warranty market has increased and they are much less expensive nowadays.  still, do your homework and check around. credit unions often offer much cheaper products that do more if you finance with them.  companies like state farm insurance now do auto financing and will give you gap for free if you finance through them!  my credit union charges $349 for gap. dealerships charge $750 and above.  i hope you can appreciate the value.

"""maxing out your 401(k)"" means contributing $18,500 per year, not just contributing enough to max out your company match.. unless your company arbitrarily limits your contributions or you are a highly compensated employee you are able to contribute $18,500 into your 401(k) plan. in order to max out you would need to contribute $18,500 into the plan of your own money. 

all that being said. contributing to your 401(k) at any percentage  is a good thing but i think people get the wrong idea by saying they max out because they are contributing say 6% and ""maxing out the employer match""",10
"you're taking a huge risk by linking venmo or paypal to your primary banking accounts.. your checking/savings accounts are very secure. they are heavily regulated including numerous laws designed to protect consumers.

venmo/paypal is none of the above. it is possible for someone to gain access to your venmo account (either by hacking in or even by sending you an unauthorized transfer). your connected checking/savings account can then be drained.

a lot of people mistakenly assume than venmo offers the same or even better consumer protections against fraud as their bank account, but this is untrue. having a secure checking account and then connecting it to venmo/paypal is like locking your door, arming your alarm and then leaving all your windows wide open.

**what should you do instead?**

there are at least two better options:

**for infrequent users, use a credit card (not a debit card) to send money, and just leave incoming transfers in venmo.**

yes, you will have to pay a fee for each cc transaction (usually 3%), but that 3% pays for an additional level of fraud prevention/protection from the cc company. for incoming transfers, it's not going to hurt anything to leave a few hundred dollars parked in venmo.

**for frequent users, link an air gap checking account to your venmo.**

lots of industries use air gaps as part of their safety/security protocols. an air gap checking account is an account that's connected to venmo and not connected to anything else. if you want to transfer money to/from your air gap account, you'll need to physically withdraw cash from one account and physically deposit it in the other.

sure, both of these options may be inconvenient, and they may cost some extra money in cc fees or account fees. but here's the thing you need to keep in mind: if you can't afford to pay 3% in cc fees, or you can't afford to leave $200 parked in venmo, or you can't afford the account fees to open another checking account, then **you definitely can't afford to have your primary banking accounts drained** by fraudulent venmo charges.",10

"when it comes to discuss salary, your current salary is irrelevant.. recently i was in contact with several headhunters via linkedin. i could not spend time energy doing all the calls and interviews, so i asked (nicely) the headhunters about the salary range and benefits. some never got back to me. some asked me about my current salary and my expectation. 

i simply said no, my current salary is irrelevant.

this is something that was commonly advised, but i don't think everyone understand how important it is.

in most of the cases, the company already has a budget for the new position, and also in most of the cases, they want to pay as little as possible ( unless you are crazily good and they are really desperate to get you). if they can pay you less and still make you happy (because it's already 30% higher than your current salary), why would they pay you more (even if they totally can)? ( such employers exist, but they are not the majority). same goes as expected salary.

you are worth what you bring to your new employer. you might be heavily underpaid with your current employer, but that has nothing to do with the negotiations.

for me, it is always salary and benefits upfront. if it is a match then i will proceed further, otherwise, ""thanks, but may be next time"". that saves both sides time and effort. they already know a fair amount of my information from my linkedin profile, therefore, what to expect from me, why can't i know what i can expect from them.

in the end i got back a few ranges, which i politely said i will not proceed further, and only continued with 2 headhunters that provide a number i am comfortable with (even though it contains the infamous phrase""up to"", at least i know what i can expect). 

am waiting for an offer, but that is a different story. (edit: by ""waiting"", i meant i got words from a potential employer that they are working on an offer tailored specific for me (i let them know what i demand and they basically agreed on the terms, but the details need to be worked on. i am not just waiting for any offer)",10
"dash cams. after my wife telling me numerous stories of being ran off the road and close calls, i researched and ultimately purchased two $100 dash cams for both of our vehicles for a total of about $198 on amazon . they came with a power adapter and a 16gb micro sd card as a part of a limited time promotion. i installed both of them earlier this year by myself within a few hours by using barebones soldering skills and some common hand tools for a ""stealth wiring"" configuration. 

recently, my wife was in an accident and our dash cam has definitively cleared us of all liability. the other party claimed that my wife was at fault and that her lights were not on. her dash cam showed that not only was my wife's lights on prior to the impact, but the other party was shown clearly running a stop sign which my wife failed to mention in the police report due to her head injury. needless to say, our $200 investment has already paid for itself. 

with all of that in mind, i highly recommend a dash cam in addition to adequate insurance coverage for added financial peace of mind. too many car accidents end up in he said/she said nonsense with both parties' recollection being skewed in favor of their own benefit. 

car accidents are already a pain. do yourselves a favor and spend $100 and an afternoon installing one of these in your vehicle. future you will inevitably thank you someday. 

edit: thanks everyone for sharing your stories and asking questions. i'm glad i can help some of you out. with that said, i keep getting the same question frequently so here's a copy/paste of my response. 


wheelwitness hd is the dash cam i own. 

honestly, anything with an above average rating of 4 stars in the $100 range that isn't a recognized name brand is pretty much a rebrand of other cameras. if it has a generic name, i can guarantee you that they all use a handful of chipsets that can record at different settings depending on how capable it is. the only difference will be the physical appearance but guts will mostly be the same. 

as a rule of thumb, anything $100+ will probably be a solid cam. i recommend a function check monthly at a minimum. i aim to do it once a week. i found mine frozen and not recording one day. just needed a hard reboot. ",10
"credit freezes are now free. starting today.. edit 4:
i'm re-arranging and cleaning up the post to show info in a clean format, so as to answer many of the questions than has been asked, because i can't answer questions timely any more, because this post blew up. but i want everybody to understand and use this opportunity. 

**what is a credit freeze?**

a credit freeze is when you put a hold on your credit record, so that nobody can get access to it without your permission. it protects you against identity theft. even if a hacker knows all your info, including your ssn, he won't be able to use your account to get a new credit card, because you will have to unfreeze your info before they can be released. now by law, the credit reporting agencies have to respect your wishes, as to who has access to your personal credit record. once you freeze your record, it can only be accessed after if you unfreeze/thaw it.

other replies:

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9hlps3/credit_freezes_are_now_free_starting_today/e6dk0sx/

**why is this news important now?**

many experts agree that freezing your credit report is the strongest way to protect against identity theft. starting friday, you'll be able to do it free of charge. in the wake of a massive data breach last year at equifax that exposed personal information for about 148 million americans, congress amended the fair credit reporting act to require reporting agencies to freeze reports for no charge. equifax is one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the united states. the bill was passed in may(https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/free-credit-freeze/index.html). it is effective as of today.(https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/us/free-credit-freezes/index.html)

**how can i do it?**

to set up your own credit freezes, go to the freeze page at each credit agency's website individually: 

experian(https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html)

equifax(https://www.freeze.equifax.com/freeze/jsp/sff_personalidinfo.jsp)

transunion(https://freeze.transunion.com/sf/securityfreeze/landingpage.jsp). 

chexsystems(https://www.chexsystems.com/web/chexsystems/consumerdebit/page/securityfreeze/placefreeze/)

innovis (https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityfreeze)

nctue (https://exchangeservicecenter.com/freeze/jsp/sff_personalidinfo.jsp)

you will be given a pin that you'll need to lift or remove the freeze in the future. 

**do i have to do this with all credit agencies? i only have one credit card**

yes you do. your credit card reports to multiple credit reporting companies. 

**does this mean that i can freeze my credit score at 810? does freezing affect my score?**

no. a credit freeze only freezes who can *see* your credit record. your credit score will still be based on how you pay off your lenders. freezing does not affect your score.


**is credit unfreeze/thaw also free?**

yes.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9hlps3/credit_freezes_are_now_free_starting_today/e6d4v8e/)

**how long does the ""thaw"" process takes before credit is available to be pulled?**

if you do the thaw request online, the law requires it to be done within 3 hrs. 24 hrs, if you do it by mail.

**what if i lose my pin? how do i recover it**

from several posts i saw, there are methods to recover your pin/ and access your account that involves snail mail. you get letters in regular mail, which i assume is for confirming your physical address.

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9hlps3/credit_freezes_are_now_free_starting_today/e6dg4bc/


**how accurate is this info?**

to the best of my knowledge. i will update as i find better info.

"if you get ""highs"" spending money, consider downloading an app that lets you pay down student loans. this isn't my idea but i couldn't find who posted it long ago when i saw it. well, i did it and it's worked well.  i found myself going out for a drink or bite to eat when i didn't really have a great reason to. instead, i took that money i would have spent and payed down a loan with a quick click. (not always) it feels great. about as great as i felt getting that drink on the way home after work. i did try robinhood too but that felt very different to me and wasn't as rewarding.

edit: the app i use is my lenders, great lakes. people here are saying use changed as well which works like acorn. 

edit: yes, i know playing the market may yield more than paying down my lower interest loans but that's not the point. it is to chip away at a daunting 10+ year loan. it is also no risk.",10
"i caught myself shopping for a new car (that i can't afford) because mine was ""worn out"".. i have a 2006 honda accord 4cyl that has 225,000 miles on it. i drive it to and from work every day (for 5 years) and it has been acting up on me lately. a tire leaks air, the brakes are bad, and i'm having troubles while accelerating. not to mention my two toddlers have trashed the interior. i chalked it up to being time to buy an upgrade.


i started searching for cars online. i can get this 2016 for just $18,000! but i might as well go new for a lower interest rate. that's only $25,000 for a brand new car. i have about $2,000 budgeted for car repairs that i can add to trade-in value on my accord and will come away with a super nice vehicle at a low monthly rate.


as i continued searching, i kept trying to fight reality. in actuality, i have the ability to fix every one of these issues, but my own laziness is tempting me to find the easy way out.


i got online and found new brake rotors and pads, air and oil filters, and spark plugs. i got my oil from a local mega-chain. in one day i plugged a tire (nail), changed my air filter, changed out the brakes, changed my oil, and changed my plugs. in total it may have cost me a hundred bucks and a weekend day. i also cleaned up all the trash and clothes, and vacuumed the car. i felt so accomplished when i was finished.


i swear, it feels like i'm driving a whole new car. now looking back, it seems silly that i wanted to buy a new car just for convenience of not having to deal with preventative maintenance. before you make a large purchase, take a step back and ask yourself if it's really necessary. i consider myself great with money but apparently very lazy as well haha.



edit: many posters have recommended other semi-diy preventative maintenance jobs for older cars. do these at your own risk. there should be plenty of instructional videos on youtube. (in no particular order):


replace water pump

replace control arm bushing

replace tie rod end

flush brake fluid

change transmission fluid

replace serpentine belt

clean mass airflow/map sensor

clean throttle body

replace fuel filter

replace shocks/struts",10
"student loan balance: $0. thank you pf for all of your help, and please accept my personal contribution.. **edit (2019.01.03):** updated template can be found in this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ac701m/happy_new_year_pf_after_a_year_and_a_half_i_am/).

**edit:** several people requested access to the spreadsheet. you shouldn't need to request access. you should be able to `file > make a copy...`. please pm me if you are unable to do so.

i was raised in a family where finances were not ever discussed other than the fact that we did or did not have it. my father was an optimistic entrepreneur who struck gold, time and time again on many of his business ventures, but always found a way to blow through his riches with little to show for it. factor in my mother who was a hoarder and you had the perfect formula for disaster. i won't stroll too deep down memory lane, but long story short, i never completed my college degree and decided to go straight into the workforce instead.

seven years ago, i was laid off from a job that was ""paying the bills"" with no degree to fall back on. i made the decision to go back to school and about two years into my degree, i was caught in a financial bind, worrying about how i was going to take care of next semester's tuition. fortunately for me, i had an amazing aunt, uncle, sister, and bil who helped cover my expenses. after that incident, i swore to myself that as soon as i graduated, i would take charge of my own finances and do everything in my power to avoid going down the same path as my parents.

i've been a long-time lurker and have read countless personal stories shared on this subreddit throughout the years. even if the situation didn't apply to my own life, i took the time to sympathize with what others are going through in the event that i too may one day endure the same hardship. i silently cheered behind the scenes along with each success story shared. this sub is a daily read for me and became my source of encouragement towards living a debt-free life.

today, i get to share my own success story. i made a plan after graduating to aggressively pay off my student loans and have been blessed enough to have the means to do. i have made the final payment on my student loans. from $22,601.14 to $0 in 27 months.

along with the good news, i wanted to give back to the community that has been so helpful all these years. i created a spreadsheet to track my various finances and i'm hoping that it will help others as well.

**personal finance template:** 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rjhe3atepyuoe1wzpb9wmr2h7vfj45_iqc1jutr4wly/edit?usp=sharing

it may seem like there is a lot going on, but i will try my best to describe each tab in-depth to make it seem less scary.

**student loans:** my student loans were broken down into different groups (a, b, c, d) at different interest rates. i wanted to calculate the total interest over the life of each loan based on a set payment amount, so i made a rough amortization chart.

> **f2:** enter your interest rate.  
> **h2:** enter your desired monthly payment.  
> **m2:** enter your loan balance.

i wanted to find the sweet spot for what i felt comfortable paying while also trying to minimize the total accrued interest as best as i could, so i played around with various numbers for `h2`.

as an example, i entered $200 in `h2`. now i am searching for the row where the value in `column m` is negative. this happens in `m30`.

that means that if i make a monthly payment of $200 (`h2`), i would pay it off in 30 months (`g32`) and accrue $281.64 of total interest (`k32`).

i repeated the same process for $56.57 (the recommended minimum payment from my student loan provider), $150, $175, and $250 and then made a chart in `o1:r6` (http://i.imgur.com/c2yuvqg.png).

i calculated the savings based on how much **less** interest i would pay over the life of the loan if i paid more than the minimum payment. this became such a big motivator for me to continue to make aggressive payments that i decided to add it to the **summary** tab.

**summary:** this tab is exactly what it sounds like; it is a summary of all of my finances so that i can get a snapshot view of where my money is, along with my net worth, average credit score, and student loan ""savings"".

> **b2:** i update this formula once a month. currently the formula is `='2017.06'!$q$200`, pointing to the `2017.06` spreadsheet.. when june ends, i will simply update the formula to point to `='2017.07'!$q$200`.  
> **b10:** this is also updated monthly. next month, i would change the formula from `='credit score'!$f$20` to `='credit score'!$f$21`.

**2017.04, 2017.05, 2017.06:** this is where the bulk of the work comes in.

> **a:** enter the date of the posted transaction. if the transaction is still pending, leave the date blank until it has posted.  
> **b:** enter the merchant for the transaction. this column uses the **merchants** tab for data validation. to add a new merchant, simply add another entry in column **a** of the **merchants** tab.  
> **c:** enter the category for the transaction. this simply helps categorize your spending. use the **categories** tab for data validation.  
> **d:** enter all credit transactions to your bank account in this column.  
> **e:** enter all debit transactions to your bank account in this column.  
> **f:j**: i have four credit cards that i use in rotation. enter all credit card transactions under the corresponding column (adjust columns as needed).  
> **k:** this column shows the current balance of your bank account.  
> **l:p:** these columns shows the current balance of each of your credit cards.  
> **q:** i call this column the ""reality check"". it shows your true balance: the cash you have in your bank account minus all of the debts across your credit cards.
> **s:t:** this gives you a breakdown of where you are spending your money. it is another helpful way to keep your spending in check and should help you budget.

it might seem like a lot of work, but it has become routine enough for me that it takes me no more than 10 minutes in the morning.

my routine:  

1. log into charles schwab.
2. enter pending transactions (columns **b:j**).
3. enter dates for previously pending transactions (column **a**).
4. repeat 1-3 for citi, discover, amex, capital one.
5. select the columns that are out of order, then click `data > sort sheet by column a, a -> z`.

let's go through an example. 

in tab `2017.06`, i have the following pending transactions: http://i.imgur.com/xk1v89r.png

after logging into my accounts, i found that these transactions are all posted now, so i have entered the dates of the posted transactions in column `a`: http://i.imgur.com/wcry4gh.png

my transactions are out of order, which will happen often with pending transactions, so now i have to sort them.

i select columns `a53:j39` up to posted date `6/11`: http://i.imgur.com/b9rjttp.png

then click `data > sort sheet by column a, a -> z`: http://i.imgur.com/uib4kk7.png

my transactions are now sorted! http://i.imgur.com/qw7fw9r.png

that is pretty much all i do for daily transactions, though there are two things i want to make note of.

> **paying credit card bills:** when paying a credit card bill, i enter a debit in column `e` as well as a credit in the corresponding credit card column.
> 
> for instance, i paid my citi credit card bill on 6/2/2017 in the amount of $143. this is what that transaction looks like: http://i.imgur.com/fltk8bl.png

> **look-ahead:** often times, i will enter transactions that have not happened yet further down the spreadsheet. for example, if i know i have a credit card bill due later this month, or a rent payment, or an incoming paycheck, i will enter it in order to ""look ahead"" of my finances. this teaches me discipline in how i am spending my current balance while making sure that i am preparing for upcoming expenses.
> 
> an example of this can be seen in rows `90:91`: http://i.imgur.com/o5nhlrw.png
> 
> i know that i have a credit card bill due on 7/3, and i also have another paycheck coming on 6/30. entering both of these transactions allows me to gauge how prepared i am when that time comes.

at the end of the month, i simply right-click `2017.06` and click `duplicate`, renaming the new spreadsheet to `2017.07`. i also make sure that all of the formulas in `d2:j2` correctly point to the previous month.

> **d2:** change `='2017.05'!k200` to `='2017.06'!k200`  
> **f2:** change `='2017.05'!l200` to `='2017.06'!l200`  
> **g2:** change `='2017.05'!m200` to `='2017.06'!m200`  
> **h2:** change `='2017.05'!n200` to `='2017.06'!n200`  
> **i2:** change `='2017.05'!o200` to `='2017.06'!o200`  
> **j2:** change `='2017.05'!p200` to `='2017.06'!p200`

**ally savings 1.00% apy**: this tab follows the same structure as the monthly tabs.

**stocks owned:** i use this tab to keep track of the current stocks that i own.

> **a:** enter the stock ticker.  
> **b:** enter the purchase date.  
> **c:** enter the number of shares purchased.  
> **d:** enter the purchase price.

rows `25:37` helps me track when i should sell the stock and what my net gain/loss would be.

> **c26:** enter the number of shares purchased.  
> **d26:** enter the purchase price.

the chart will show you what the sell price would be for a `10.00% - 65.00%` gross profit.

**stocks sold:** this just helps me keep track of my stocks sold over the years. i copy and paste the values directly from **stocks owned** when i choose to sell.

**401k:** this tab tracks all of my 401k transactions.

> **c:** enter the money contributed for the month.  
> **d:** enter the amount of gain/loss for the month.

columns `g:i` will give you the year-to-date statistics, but it is pretty barebones at the moment.

**hsa:** this tab follows the same structure as the monthly tabs.

**hsa investment:** this tab follows a similar structure as the **401k** tab.

**credit score:** this tab keeps track of my monthly free credit estimates offered by my credit cards. columns `h:i` tracks roughly what date a new credit score is available. it's interesting to see how your credit score is affected month to month based on various factors. for instance, my credit utilization was high from 09/2016 - 12/2016 due to the holidays and various trips. my credit took a dip for that period and then has been slightly rising since.

"grandparents gifted me & s/o 100g of 99.99% gold to start a college fund, since we are expecting a baby. how do i convert this literal bar of gold into a more fungible/secure investment?. photo of the gold bar(http://imgur.com/b2al4np). i have no idea if the serial number or seal i covered up are secure, so my apologies if this is a terrible photo

i looked around for any advice about selling gold and apmex, local coin collectors, and /r/pmsforsale were all recommended. ""cash for gold"" stores were universally panned. 

however, since i'm interested in eventually throwing this money into an index fund (maybe even a gold etf) i was wondering if there's an easier way to liquidate this directly with a bank. 

any help is really appreciated since i've never held more than a single silver dollar in my hand before. thanks!

edit: wow this blew up! thanks y'all. to clarify a few things: yes my grandparents are chinese, but no they don't care about the gold bar remaining physically gold. they're much more interested in the grandkid becoming a doctor, so if reinvesting the gold bar helps that, they're fully on board :) ",10

all,

this thread will serve as the r/personalfinance official mega thread for discussing the recent equifax security breach(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-07/equifax-reports-cybersecurity-incident-potentially-impacting-143-million-u-s-customers). /r/legaladvice also has a mega thread on this issue(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6yvj5c/megathread_equifax_security_breach/) if you want to focus on legal options. the tl;dr of that thread is wait to join a class action and do not sue in small claims court.

**summary:**

* ""equifax inc. said its systems were struck by a cyberattack that may have affected about 143 million u.s. customers of the credit reporting agency...some u.k. and canadian residents were also affected."" canadian thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinancecanada/comments/6yq9gu/equifax_hacked_canadian_consumers_might_be/) and uk thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/comments/6yvunm/misc_uk_details_in_equifax_data_breach/)

* ""intruders accessed names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver's license numbers...credit card numbers for about 209,000 consumers were also accessed.""

* ""criminals took advantage of a ""u.s. website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files"" from mid-may through july of this year...the intruders also accessed dispute documents with personal identifying information for about 182,000 consumers.""

* ""the company set up a website, www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, that consumers can use to determine whether their information was compromised. it's also offering free credit-file monitoring and identify-theft protection.""

* the purpose of this sub is not to provide legal advice. however, per https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/frequently-asked-questions/
""the arbitration clause and class action wavier included in the trustedid premier terms of use applies to the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products, and not the cybersecurity incident.""

* **identity theft wiki** - please see the identity theft wiki(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) for steps to take if your identity has been stolen. you may wish to freeze your credit with the different reporting agencies. note that their websites are currently under a heavy load and may be unresponsive. for more information on what freezing your credit means, see the ftc's explanation(https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs#score)

equifax also recently announced(https://twitter.com/equifax/status/907596989260496896) that they are waiving fees for freezing your credit with them. it is unclear if they plan to offer refunds to those that paid to do so before today.

**using www.equifaxsecurity2017.com:**

* a helpful discussion adapted from u/likeasomebodie on using www.equifaxsecurity2017.com:

* check to see if you are effected using this link(https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/)

* either of the following messages from equifax mean your information was stolen:

thank you -- based on the information provided, we believe that your personal information may have been impacted by this incident...

thank you -- your enrollment date for trustedid premier is: xxxxxx please be sure to mark your calendar...

* either of these messages mean that your ssn, dob, full address, and potentially dl number have been stolen. assume that information is now public data, because if it's not out there already someone's indexing it right now.

* please note that some media outliets are reporting that these messages are not completely reliable(https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/psa-no-matter-what-you-write-equifax-may-tell-you-youve-been-impacted-by-the-hack/) however, it still appears that using this site provides at least some information, even if it is not completely accurate.

* see the identity theft guide(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) for additional information on freezing your credit, next steps, etc...

**additional information:**

* your credit card company may offer some form of identity theft protection/credit monitoring. you should review the benefits that your card has to see if this applies to you.

* equifax is making credit freezes free for some customers; it isn't clear if this extends to everyone or only certain individuals. update - it should be free to all - see the announcement here(https://twitter.com/equifax/status/907596989260496896). no word on whether previously paid fees will be refunded, but you can call and ask.

* it appears that, in some cases, the pin you get from equifax when freezing your credit is just a time stamp of when the freeze was initiated(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/your-money/identity-theft/equifax-breach-credit-freeze.html). if this happened to you, consider requesting a new pin by mail.

* some individuals are reporting difficulty obtaining a credit freeze online. you may need to submit documents via mail if this is the case.

* there is now at least 1 class-action lawsuit(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-08/equifax-sued-over-massive-hack-in-multibillion-dollar-lawsuit) on this issue. please keep in mind that per equifax's most recent financials, it has a book value of equity of only about 3 billion dollars on total assets of about 7 billion dollars, so it seems unlikely that 70 billion, even if awarded, could actually be paid.

* u/rholowczak has put together a handy tree of phone options when calling the major credit bureaus here(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6yv4gb/official_mega_thread_recent_equifax_security/dmyg4xe/).

"my new rules for ""lending"" money.... so, when my husband and i first started trying to take our finances seriously, we noticed a particular big leak in our finances.  lending friends and family money.  my husband and i have a lot of friends who have... for lack of a more gracious term... never gotten their shit together.  since we have been making decent money for years, they started getting into the habit of calling us when they got in a financial bind.  $100 here, $20 there, $1000 there.  i realized that we very rarely ever saw any of it back.  i needed to put a stop to this, but i still wanted to be able to help my loved ones when needed.

so i came up with some rules when lending money to loved ones.

1) i never loan money.  if i can't afford to just give it to you, then i can't afford to loan it to you.  it is a gift, and i never expect to see it back.  whether you give it back is completely up to you, and we're still just as good of friends if you don't.  i will never let money come between us.

2) you only get one gift.  if you give it back, then it is no longer a gift, and you are welcome to another gift should you ever need it.  there is no limit to how many gifts you can receive and return, but only one at a time.

3) no, you cannot receive a gift, and then a day/week/month later decide you need to ""add on"" to that gift.  ask for everything you expect to need and then even a little more if you like, but no adding on more later.

4) no means no.  if you try to guilt me or otherwise manipulate me if i refuse to give you money, i will walk away, and we will not be friends or speak again until you understand that you just made me feel used and only valuable to you as a wallet.  i will only forgive this once.  more than once is a pattern that speaks volumes about what i am to you.

so far, this has gone well.  both good friends we have given money to under these rules chose to pay us back over time, and have not requested a second gift yet.  i think being able to repay us on completely their own time, of their own volition, and without any pressure from us made them feel more comfortable and respected.  we've lost some friends over money before we established these rules.  i'm really hoping that this might help plug the financial drain, and preserve friendships at the same time.

if you have any suggestions that could improve this, please feel free to post them. :) 

update: wow. well, i did not expect this to blow up like it has, but that's really cool and i appreciate all the activity, compliments, discussion, and the gold from two lovely people. :) i'm trying to answer any questions directed at me, but on mobile this is a lot to shift through, so feel free to tag me or whatever if you want me to answer or comment on something. thanks everyone for an awesome discussion :)",10
"friendly reminder that there's no harm in asking your credit card company to refund your late fee.. (though it's no excuse of course) i have been rather busy this past month and recently got sick and forgot to pay my chase credit card bill, which meant i ended up with a $25 late fee. i just paid today, which was about 2 days late, and immediately after paying online, i called their customer service number.

funnily enough, i didn't even have to ask for her to refund the late fee, because she knew right away that that was what i was calling for. i remained polite and she refunded it for me. (i also have the fact that i typically pay the bill on time and this was my first time paying late, so if you're a late payer, this is probably not the best policy).

there's no harm in asking!",10

"there's no such thing as a ""1099 employee."" if your employer controls where and how you work and how you get paid, you're probably a w-2 employee and not an independent contractor.. i see quite a few threads on this sub asking about taxes and pay as an ""independent contractor"" or ""1099 employee"" where the op goes on to say they have a set schedule, set work assignments, and get paid at regular intervals. this is not what an independent contractor is, and there's a good chance the worker in question is being misclassified as a contractor when they're in fact an employee.

employers misclassify employees as contractors in order to avoid paying payroll taxes like unemployment insurance premiums and the employer's share of fica (social security and medicare) withholdings. the misclassified workers also don't get the protection of worker's compensation or other employment laws. it's a rampant problem (especially in recent years), and any ""independent contractor"" should take a careful look at their business relationship.

there are laws in most states that distinguish a true contractor from an employee, and the irs has its own set of standards (see https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee(https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee)). in a nutshell, being a contractor or employee comes down to how much control the business paying you has over your work and finances.

* if the business you're working for can tell you when, where, and how to work or has set methods/procedures, you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if your job performance is measured against the business's standards, you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if the business you're working for reimburses your expenses, gives you tools/equipment and materials to do your work, or pays you by the hour, week, month, etc., you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if you only work for one company, provide services to them full-time, and do so continuously (i.e. not project-based work), you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if you can quit or be fired at any time without cause/notice or financial repercussions (i.e. working at-will), you're probably not an independent contractor.

if you think you might actually be an employee based on factors like these, but are getting a 1099-misc instead of a w-2 and are being treated as a ""contractor,"" **please report it** to your state's revenue agency, unemployment agency, and/or labor department. you can also file form ss-8 with the irs, but the irs is very underfunded/understaffed right now, so you may want to reach out to your state's agencies first. your state can probably do an audit and then refer the findings to the irs on its own.

worker misclassification is a huge problem that needs more attention. businesses might save on payroll taxes by passing off employees as ""contractors,"" but the misclassified worker gets all of the tax liability and none of the protections.

tl;dr – employees get misclassified as ""independent contractors"" all the time. know the factors and report it if you think something's amiss.",10
"i'm 25, i hate my corporate desk job, and i have about 30,000 saved up. what can i do investment wise to get out of this while i'm still young?. as the title states i'm getting really unhappy at my current job. i don't have any debt minus my car note (have about $12,000 left which i intend to pay off in 24 months). my monthly expenses come out to about \~$1100 with rent/bills. i'm in a position where my job is draining the life out of me and i'm losing the energy and charisma i used to have. i do intend on speaking with a financial advisor but i would greatly appreciate any help because i'm honestly afraid of slowly becoming too depressed and unmotivated to do anything about it. i also can't deal with interest due to religious constraints so unfortunately i understand that it limits my options somewhat. i truly appreciate any advice that anyone can offer. i'm just in a position in my life where i want to make a change to be happy once more. thank you everyone.

"i have 2 master degrees and haven't been able to find a job for the past 12 months. i don't know what i'm doing wrong.. i have a masters in math and one in finance, both from state schools. finished both with 4.0s. i did my undergrad at a ""public ivy,"" but only got a 2.75 there. i was happy with my scholastic performance turnaround and only applied for competitive jobs at the beginning of my job search. as time has passed, i've been applying to anything and everything. i've been living off of a small inheritance, but that money is almost gone. i've recently applied to be a teller at a bank and at a local target - no interview for either.

"someone walked into a branch pretending to be me and got a debit card replacement. withdrew $1000 immediately. advice needed. this happened in toronto earlier this month. the bank is cibc. 

&#x200b;

yesterday i found out that i could not log into my mobile banking app and called their service number. i was told somebody walked into a branch with a fake id and claimed he lost his debit card. apparently the teller gave him a replacement and added a new contact number to the account. he withdrew 1000 dollar from atm. he then went to money mart and try to get more cash which caused cibc to trigger a fraud alert and locked the card. i have been overseas since august and won't be able to come back until next february. i have my debit card with me the entire time. haven't receive any funny messages or emails. i was told a investigation case has been opened and i should call then back in 10 business days. meanwhile a new debit card would be mailed to my current address (overseas). once i have received it i can access online banking again. i am quite baffled by what happened. i have chequing, visa, mortgage and line  with cibc. without online banking i could not access my accounts or even try to see if any other accounts have been compromised. furthermore i do not know what kind of personal information has been leaked. did the bad guys just know my name and address and then made a false id and tried their luck at different banks? or is there some other things they have got about me that made the teller believe he is the real deal? btw i have an obvious chinese name. which might make impersonating me a possibility. 

&#x200b;

right now this seems surreal and i just have a lot of questions. will i be liable about the $1000? any further steps should i take to minimize other potential losses? should i inform the police or is the bank doing that? can i make a police report while overseas? any advice is deeply appreciated. many thanks.

"if your bank calls you, even if the phone number is legit, don't verify anything, call them back first. this may also get posted in /r/tifu(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu) as well ... 'cause i'm a dummy.

got a call today from my bank (caller id confirmed) saying they'd seen fraud on my atm card (telling me the last 4 digits of my atm card) at a walmart in florida.

i live in colorado. of course that wouldn't be me, and yes i do have the atm card in my possession. they never asked for the full card number.

while they put me on a brief hold to verify something, i did a reverse lookup on the phone number, it did match my bank. they sent me an sms code to verify over the phone, the shortcode of the sending number also matched my bank's sms shortcode.

figured everything was legit, gave them my home address to ship me my new card. they put me back on hold ""to talk to a manager"" to waive an additional fee to expedite sending the card.

but it was not my bank.

while they put me on that second hold they withdrew almost $1,000 in small increments at an atm in california. (again, i live in colorado)

i hung up, \*i\* called my bank, they verified they did not call me, had no record of possible fraud in florida but that the six atm withdrawals in california did flag as fraud.

i happened to record the phone call of the ""bank"" calling me, so i'm sending the phone recordings to my \*actual\* bank.

meanwhile i have to wait 10 days to get the $1,000 back. yay.

thank goodness for things like an emergency fund, so the lack of the cash doesn't hurt, but still a major nuisance.

quick edit: thanks for the incoming messages about this and the genuine support. many have had similar experiences, and i posted this as a reminder to all that you should always call your bank yourself to verify anything, never verify anything on an incoming call.

\---

**edit for clarification from several comment conversations:**

here's what likely happened: they spoofed my bank's phone number, asked me where i wanted the new atm card shipped thus i verified my mailing address. they followed my bank's verification playbook and said they were sending me a verification code via sms, which i then relayed. what was very likely happening on another phone line was they were social-engineering my bank, pretending to be me, verified my mailing address, verified the sms code which i relayed to them, and likely changed my atm card pin so they could withdraw cash. even down to my bank charging a fee for rushing a new card and waiving the fee in case of fraud. this was a very clever social engineering feat.

**also an important note:** there are tons of apps out there which can record phone calls, but the legality of this depends on where you live and the location where the person/business on the other end of the call are located. one comment has a link to a lawsuit where the second party was not in a one-party-consent state, which makes recording a phone call illegal. always tell your caller that you're recording the call. i miss being on google voice that could play a message that you were recording the call etc..

\---

**friendly reminder of the day** (besides drink more water, go out and enjoy some sunshine, and be nice to one another)

if someone calls, claiming to be your bank, never verify any information even if everything like phone numbers and sms seem to match. thank them for the alert, and tell them that you'll call them right back. do not provide any information to them!",10
"you don't always need to buy a new car to get the latest features.. i have a friend with 6 year old civic that's paid off and only has 55k miles. about a month ago, i was surprised to hear him talking about getting a new car again. i asked him why he wanted to get rid of his civic and he said he rented a new car on his trip that had proximity entry, push button start, and android auto/apple carplay built in. i'm not gonna lie, once you try and get used to those, it's hard to go back to a key and regular stereo so i understood where he's coming from.

well, years ago in high school and college, i used to install car audio, alarms, remote starters, all that. i told him he can add all those features to his civic. we added proximity lock/unlock, push button start, 7"" stereo with bluetooth, android auto, and apple carplay, and a backup camera. all that ended up costing him just over $500 but now he has a car that he loves again and doesn't have to drop 20-30k on a new car. i helped him install it but even at a professional shop, that's probably no more than $1000 total.

i know there are multiple reason to buy a new(er) car, but if you like your car and just want newer features, take a look at what products are out there, you might be able to add those features to your car and save a lot of money in the long run.


edit: many people asked, so here's a partial list:

- 2102t directed pke passive keyless entry system. works extremely well, dei makes quality products. most bad reviews i've seen online were from people that didn't understand how to install it. this is a kit for professional installers so dei does not give any tech support for diy installs. 

- the stereo is user preference since there are many to choose from but he got a pioneer avh-2300nex. if you want to go cheaper, i have an atoto sa102 in my car and it doesn't have any issues. but there are probably hundreds of stereos to choose from

- push button was a generic one he found online, i don't have the mode number. just find one with decent reviews on amazon. they come in different styles so that will be user preference as well. you also need an immobilizer bypass module if your key is chipped.

- backup camera was from amazon, they are all pretty much the same so pick whatever style fits your car best.",10

edit#2 first of all: thank you! i am grateful for all the incredible support and good advice. i am currently working on communicating with different institutions for tangible help like for starters, legal. i will need to wait for the death certificate to actually start going places, the top priority is to dwell into ssn as so many of you rightfully pointed me to. i am doing well, i am peaceful i am optimistic. friends of reditt, you are all magnificent.

"i always heard that you can save money switching insurance companies every few years, but never actually shopped around until now. found $1,715 in annual savings!. i stayed with the same insurance company for auto since 2007. i added my wife to the policy when we got married in 2013, and then added a policy for our home in 2014. i noticed that the premiums were always trending up, as though there was no benefit for being a loyal customer. i finally put in the effort to shop around and found better deals for the exact same or better coverage.

i'm not sure if it's against the rules to post the names of the companies or not so i left them out. after finding the potential for savings i posted to local social media asking ""anyone have any good or bad experience with claims from company b?"" and am waiting for some feedback before i move my policies over. that said, i'm sad i didn't look into this sooner, and look forward to getting into this habit every 3-5 years.",10

her income potential is roughly $30k-$40k/yr and will never go up probably

also, we have no savings or 401k. i make 130k/yr and we live paycheck to paycheck because we are retardedly financially irresponsible....and somehow are able to waste that money without buying luxury goods, drugs, or gambling...

"i'm 18 and i will be homeless soon. please help.. i'm an 18 year old guy and soon to be homeless. to preface:
i've been living with my mom who has mental issues and was basically a ticking time bomb. today we had a small argument and she suddenly went absolutely insane. i'm going to spare the details but if you were to listen to the breakdown from outside you'd think someone was being murdered. her breakdown is over but she says ""she's done with everything"" and is leaving the apartment so that the rent will not be paid. we'll likely soon be evicted anyway because of the damage to the apartment.
so that's the situation. i need advice on how to get through this... for reference:

i have no money for at least a week. we have always been extremely poor, living paycheck to paycheck and often that wasn't even enough, etc. my mom (when she was being normal) told me to quit my job last year and focus on school, so i did.

but, i did get a job this week to pay for school transportation, but since i just started i barely have any weekly hours and my paycheck is at least a week away. but i'd like some tips on what to do once i get it.

i'm enrolled in a massage therapy school and i have a student loan taken out for it, so leaving is not an option. but everyone is very nice there so i can probably ask for some help there on monday.

i've seen others like me come here in a crisis. if you know any subreddits i should x-post this to please let me know, i'll be checking my notifications as i pack my stuff.

i typed this up fast so i'm sorry if some things aren't clear, i'll reorganize this later. thank you for reading.

edit 1: thanks to everyone who has advised me so far. unless there's a better idea or a reason not to, it's looking like joining the military is the best choice for me. i've got no family, and my friends don't even live on their own yet. my new job is not giving me nearly enough work hours to live off of. i don't have much wiggle room, unless i can convince my boss to give a brand new guy full time hours. if there's any advice about this choice you can offer, please do.

edit 2: wow, a ton of people are dropping advice. thank you so much. please give me some time to respond to the comments and messages. bless you all

edit 3: i spoke to my landlord and he's giving me some time to get on my feet. he told me he'd call in 6 weeks to see what my plan is. so i have a little time.

additionally i've formally decided to join the air force (and quit massage school). i took the practice asvab and got a great score so to all the people pming me worried about me dying in the military --  don't worry, i will probably have more flexibility in my placement than you think. i'll make a final update when i have my start date, so again thank you to everyone in this thread who provided advice.",10
"ordered something online, ups delivered to wrong address, package was refused, company wont refund me even though it wasn't my fault and it's being returned within their time frame of allowing returns. can i refute the charge on my card?. i live in the us, ordered a moderately expensive item from a company in china and it was delivered to the wrong address and refused. after talking to ups they said it was the company's fault because they put the address on the label weird and ups cant do anything about turning the package back around and getting it to me.

i have contacted the company multiple times and they haven't done anything but tell me to contact ups and have ignored my requests for a refund. can i just refute the charge on my credit card and get my refund that way since i will have never actually gotten the product?

"old bastard here. the biggest 'out of left field' change i have witnessed is i have to negotiate a better price every year for household bills like electricity and car insurance. 30 years ago i would just pay them without question.. car insurance came in. they dropped the renewal by 15% just because i said i wanted to look elsewhere.  

it is a freaken game. the whole 'i need to see the manager' bull for authorisation to lower the quote.  

years ago i would have felt bad. now it is routine to ask for a better price.

edit 3 hours in. thanks for the great replies everyone. i'll do my best to get some upvotes back at you.

"for years i paid interest on maxed out ccs. after paying them off, i challenged myself to make the money back from the banks. this year i earned $2000 worth of cc rewards while raising my credit score from 590 to 715.. i understand cc rewards and credit scores are not the cornerstones of personal finance. but this one is personal: 

as a freshman in college, i found out my parents took out credit cards in my name and maxed them out. it was a shit show. however, while they did something terrible i understand their reasons (survival -- they were hopeless). this left me with $3,000 dollars of credit card debt. during undergrad and grad school, i could never pay these off and kept sending $50 to the banks each month just to keep them from going delinquent. sometimes, i missed payments.

in another post, i explained how after grad school i was able to pay off all my debt and raise my score from 590 to 705 in half a year(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/54qsmw/this_summer_i_paid_off_all_my_cc_debt_raised_my/). hallelujah! 

so i started doing what i always wanted to do: use credit cards responsibly. moreover, **i was on a mission to earn the money back that i had to pay in interest all those years.** i closed most of my old cards as they also had annual fees and no perks but kept my discover card. i was able to upgrade it to discover it immediately and start earning a percentage back. i was surprised only a couple months later when i got a pre-selected letter for the citi double cash back card. i signed on. i also became an avid fan of nerdwallet(https://www.nerdwallet.com) reviews and other blogs about the best rewards cards and how to use them wisely.

here's the breakdown of my crusade:
-----------

discover it(https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/discover-it) ------------------------- $147 -- % back.

chase freedom(https://thepointsguy.com/2016/04/chase-sapphire-freedom-unlimited-power-duo/)	--------------------$313 -- worth in points. signup bonus + % back.

chase saphire prefered(https://thepointsguy.com/2016/04/chase-sapphire-freedom-unlimited-power-duo/) ------------$600 -- worth in points. signup bonus + % back.

citi double cash(https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/citibank-double-cash-card) --------------------$350 -- 2% back on everything. this is my catch-all card.

hilton honors(https://www.valuepenguin.com/hilton-hhonors-credit-card) -----------------------$400 -- value of 80k points(https://thepointsguy.com/2017/06/june-2017-monthly-valuations/). signup bonus.

bank of amer cash rewards(https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/bank-of-america-bankamericard-cash-rewards-visa-signature) ------ $150 -- signup bonus after spending $500. 

amazon store card ------------------$40 -- signup bonus. i wanted to pre-order destiny 2, sue me. 

chase banking account -------------$200 -- this wasn't a cc but i got $200 for moving to a chase account. 

-------------

so that's where i stand right now. it's important to note that i always pay my credit cards in full each month. and while i know my credit score could be higher if i was letting my average credit history grow, i'm happy with it in the 700s at the moment. i imagine soon i'll end this crusade and cancel the sign-up bonus cards. at that time, i'll cozy up to my double cash card and spend a life together.

-------------

**edit**

1. i've gotten some messages that i'm likely just letting my spending creep up to meet these goals. this is *absolutely* something people should try to avoid. personally, i track my monthly spending for each category and set goals of what i want to spend in each per month before looking for ccs. this helps me avoid spending more just to make a reward bonus.

2. bank bonuses! i forgot to mention i switched to a new bank for a $200 credit. haven't spent a dime there either, just needed to set up a direct deposit with chase.

**tl;dr** i spent years in cc debt due to my parent's fuck up. i paid them all off finally a year ago and have comitted to being a wise cc user. without increasing my spending, i started taking advantage of every cc signup bonus, cc % back, or checking account signup bonuses i could to get that money back.

"credit employee at mattress firm offered to check our credit, got our info and signed us up for a credit card without our permission. currently fighting the bank to fix. went shopping for mattresses, and the employee offered to check and see what we would be approved for if we decided to finance.  we agreed, and the employee took down a lot of information (ssn, address, dob, income, etc).  he came back and said we were approved for something around $7800 in financing.

we ended up leaving and going to a different store.  a few weeks later, credit karma reports a 50 point hit on our credit.  then a day or two after that we get a letter from synchrony bank giving us our two new credit cards.  that we never signed for or agreed to.

i called the bank immediately, cancelled the account, and explained multiple times that we did not sign up for this account, and that we were misled.  we only agreed to checking to see what we could get approved for, not for actually getting a card.  the rep on the phone was helpful, and got the request submitted.

fast-forward to a month later, and i get this letter:

"if you use alexa, make sure ""she"" didn't subscribe you to amazonmusic unlimited without your knowledge!. i noticed i had a charge on my card for amazonmusic unlimited. i reached out to amazon and they said the subscription was activated by my alexa enabled device in the kitchen - no one in my house would have done this since we have a family pandora premium plan. the amazon rep told me if you request a song thats part of unlimited, it may subscribe you. this is crazy - check your accounts just in case. also, you can change the default music service for alexa i just found out - so that's my next step. 
they gave me a full refund and cancelled the subscription by the way.

edit: hi all! i haven't had time to read through all the comments, however there may be some questions about small children activating it etc.
it's just me and my wife in my household, no small children or any other guests within the last month when it was activated. my wife and i definitely didn't knowingly accept or ask for it, but we may have accidentally done it??

edit 2: ok a couple more updates for all the questions and such. mystery solved! i listened to the recording (all my alexa interactions are recorded apparently) and it was my wife's sarcastic ""ok"" that did it. no i didn't call and ""chew"" out anyone at amazon - i've worked my share at call centers so i'm not that guy - they knew i didn't want the subscription and refunded it right away - this was more of a psa for people who weren't aware - but most of you are; good! 
what did i learn: turn off voice purchasing!! thanks everyone for the tips and help.",10
"another lesson in ""do not sign till you sleep on it."". my 2001 subaru forester that i love dearly just had the clutch replaced last month. driving home from the mall on sunday, i was passing a big new and used car lot and i heard ""pop!"" from my motor and lost all power. i coasted the subaru into a parking spot at the car lot, and called the partner to come get me. 

while i'm waiting, i was approached by a salesman who reminded me that a 2001 car is 16 years old. he showed me a kia that was similar in shape and size to my subaru. the price on the windshield was just over $10,000. 

the husband showed up, diagnosed the subaru as a busted timing belt, and got into the conversation with the salesman on the kia. i hemmed and hawed, we did the math, yes i could afford it, but going $10,000 in debt was not what i had planned for a sunday afternoon. my down payment was going to have to wait for my bank to open on monday anyway. i got the guy's card, took pics of the vin # on the kia, and headed to the husband's car.

at the last minute, the credit manager runs out the door and puts a piece of paper in front of me. he says ""60 months at $178 and you drive away in this kia tonight."" i said ""why would i sign something without having slept on it? i'll be back tomorrow with my down payment."" 

i went home and did the math on his offer and discovered that he didn't calculate my down payment. i was not happy about the offer at all. i read some low reviews on that make and model of kia. then i read some shitty history on the vin search about that particular car. still, however, i had no car to drive, and i need to commute from the 'burbs to the city every day.

the next morning, before the bank opened, i called my mechanic and asked him ""what do you think about this model kia?"" his response was ""what happened to your subaru?"" i told him that my partner diagnosed the timing belt issue. he said ""that's a $500 fix. the valves don't get bent on that motor. tow it over here."" for another $200 he's going to replace the windshield that picked up a crack recently. plus the tow bill, the whole thing is less than $800. less than the down-payment i was going to pull out of savings. 

so now have my old subaru back, i'm not $10,000 in debt, i don't need full coverage insurance because there's no loan on it, and someone else can buy that pos kia. dodged that bullet.

don't ever sign anything that big without sleeping on it. 

edit: i will trust my mechanic long before i will trust a stranger's advice on the internet, so you can stop telling me how stupid or wrong he is. 
edit 2: i also admit that i left some info out of this post, such as my history in the auto insurance industry, which means i know cars and i know insurance. 
edit 3: the point is not that i kept the subaru; the point is that i did not buy the kia. read for comprehension, not for response. ",10

"received a job offer with the lowest pay option and was told to call back with a counter offer. no idea what i'm doing.. i received a job offer out of college as a system support engineer with a company in my area. the pay scale started at $x and i was offered $x. the scale increases by experience. i have worked in a similar job through college for 1.25 years, and it should qualify as this experience is a main reason the new company hired me.

"friend declined pay raise because he'd ""make less money"".. a friend of mine recently declined a pay raise because he believes that the higher income would somehow result in him making less money due to taxes. i didn't get into too much details with him, but he mentioned this is a result of earned income tax credit. i know the us tax system is based on marginal rates and there's no way you can ""earned less by making more"", but is there any validity to his thinking? is there any way you can loss money by earning more or vice-versa?

edit: thank you all for your thoughts and opinions. all of you were very helpful. i think i may suggest that my friend speak to a tax professional or a cpa. i agree with (most) of you that an increase in income likely won't negatively affect him.

edit2: okay here's what i learned today, and i hope some of you don't have the same thoughts as my friend; 

1. you can't lose money from taxes by making more (marginal tax system). 

2. you can't lose money from earned income credits by making more. the system decreases from a max at a rate of $0.07 per $1.00 earned. 


3. you don't lose money by working ot. ot is taxed at the same as regular wages.your company is probably calculating your tax withholding wrong. 

4. it takes a very unique situation that is heavily dependent on government benefits to ""lose money by making more"". if you think this is happening you should consult a tax expert.",10
"if you or a loved one is harmed or killed by someone's negligence, don't donate money to insurance companies by foregoing your claim.. i work in insurance defense and i rub shoulders with many insurance adjusters. i am shocked by how many people tell the insurance company they do not plan to make a claim after a loved one has been killed by a negligent driver or property owner.

before deciding not to make a claim against someone, understand that you are literally just donating money to an insurance company. if you are understandably uncomfortable with receiving money because of a loved one's death, make the claim and donate the money to a cause your loved one cared about. 

edit: i also want to point out that if you are partially at fault, we take that into account before making you an offer. so don't think, ""well, i was partially at fault too so i'll just swallow up all the costs."" if you are partially at fault, we will only offer you an amount proportional to the insured's fault. and in the extremely unlikely event it goes to trial, the jury will be instructed to do the same.",10

"changing companies is worthwhile even while in a low level position.. i'm basically just a stock boy. but i've been doing it for three years now. my old job was cutting my hours and i really couldn't afford to just stay there. 


i spent over a month trying to find a second part time job with little success. until i decided to apply for a new full time job with some competitors. it meant giving up on having two jobs and getting more than 40hrs a week, but no one wanted to give me a part time job with the odd hours stockers have to work. 


i got a call from one store within an hour of applying. and took a job from a different store that did the entire hiring process over the phone in one day because they didn't want to wait and have someone else make an offer before i could come in for an in person interview. 


now i'm making about 20% more, getting full time hours, and possibly most important of all will have health insurance (something my old job didn't provide).


i was surprised how in demand someone with experience can be, even in a low level position. although if your job is anything like mine you've had to put up with an endless stream of shitty new hires who couldn't do a job even as easy as stocking. so it makes sense why managers and hr are excited to see what should be a sure thing applying. 


this subreddit is full of information that has no use in my current financial situation. but i encourage everyone to look around at your other options. even if you don't have a degree or certification or a real carrier. companies are always hiring for low level positions, and some of them are willing to pay more to not have to train someone or worry about them not being capable of the job. 



tldr: if a stocker can get a 20% raise by changing companies you should at least give it a shot. 



also i'm on mobile and i always see people apologize for that with formatting so hopefully this doesn't look crappy. 
and i don't think i'm breaking the rules by posting a success story. the details of my own experiences are just there to help anyone else in a similar position realize this applies to them as well. i've seen plenty of posts about changing companies that i didn't feel like applied to me, so i tried to make a post that would've gotten me to explore my own options sooner.

"i love ally. they helped me out managing my shutdown finances.. i'm scrambling to deal with unexpected loss of income during the shutdown. i had $25k in an ally cd as my emergency fund . . .  i'd gambled last year that i wouldn't need the funds soon and locked them up in a 12-month cd, thinking that i could break it open and take the 60-day interest penalty if an emergency came up. 

enter the shutdown. usually i'd be ok for awhile, but i'd just made a large purchase in november that needed some belt tightening and budgeting. i hadn't budgeted for a complete loss of income. it wasn't dire, but i needed to pull the first parachute cord and liquidate the cd.

i called ally and got david from the arizona call center on the phone and asked about the penalty and told him about my shutdown situation. he said ""wait on hold a minute if you would"" and he took the situation up to his supervisor who waived the penalty and also refunded a couple of overdraft fees i'd incurred in this mess.

i've read your stories about wf being cold as shit to people impacted by the shutdown. i'm super grateful to ally for their help during a stressful time. david, if you read this, thanks a bunch! a really professional and kind operation.

throughout the rest of the night, this debit card made an alarming number of purchases to the point where i filed identity theft complaints and froze my credit (per the instructions on this sub), and transferred all of the money out of my checking account. spoke with folks at the bank again, they told me, again, that it was clear that my identity was stolen and that they'd have a specialist call me during business hours. 

spoke with specialist today and, apparently, someone else with my exact name asked for a new debit card on their account and they were given a debit card to my account. the bank person gave someone access to my account because of a ""human error."" 

received an apology email from the branch manager today saying that this never happens and that they had closed the other debit card and returned all of my money. they would also use this experience as a training exercise for future employees. 

this seems crazy to me. is there anything else that i should be doing? should i just accept the apology?

tl;dr person with same name gets debit card to my account. ",10
"experian site can give anyone your credit freeze pin. https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/experian-site-can-give-anyone-your-credit-freeze-pin/

two days i posted how effective are credit freezes in actually preventing identity theft?(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/70wt2j/how_effective_are_credit_freezes_in_actually/). it got virtually no attention, and i was disappointed, because it's an important question.

a credit freeze will not 100% prevent identity theft. pin's, like ssns, can only be so secure. this discovery on the experian site is proof of it.

while a freeze will certainly will make things more difficult for hackers, it is not 100% a guarantee of protection.",10
"always, always check that your employer is actually paying you what they said they would.. this may seem like common sense to most, but i'm posting in case it helps even one person not make the mistake i did.

in august of last year, i was offered a promotion, full time, and a 3$/hr raise at my current job (a small b2b software company). i'm a new graduate so this was my first ""grown up"" job with benefits. i accepted and just assumed the pay raise would be reflected september 1st since my boss, his boss, and hr had all signed off on paperwork saying it would be. full time hours did hit and there was more money in my account...my timecard only shows hours, not rate, so i just assumed all was well. 


well, my fiance and i were combining budgets, and his hourly rate is the same as mine should be...but somehow, he was making a lot more? i checked with hr and it turns out, due to a paperwork error they never increased my pay. i've been receiving my old rate the past 7 months. i feel like an idiot! but, i'm going to get back pay to the tune of $3,000+ plus the incentive i was offered on start up and never actually received. 

so, don't be me. check that your company is actually paying you what they said they would, and never, ever assume when it comes to your paycheck. :)

"lyft charged me $100 for vomiting in the car. as shaggy famously said ""it wasn't me"". saturday i was out with buddies, went bar hopping. one of the lyft drivers filed a cleaning fee for $100 for vomiting in their car. don't get me wrong we were all drunk but we can all remember that ride and no one threw up. i filed a dispute, they responded back saying too bad driver provided proof (picture of the side of the car). now, im not sure if i should let my cc company deal with it or respond by saying ""i'm not arguing that there is throw up on her car, i'm arguing it wasn't us"". how should i handle this situation? i'm not trying to pull a fast one on the driver, if one of us threw up i would totally pay but it wasnt me.

update : 

i found the pictures.. can seem to upload them to the post.. help lol is it to late to post a picture with my post?

update 2:

 i tried to look at the data, i can't seem to find any useful information. any wizards out there willing to help? these are the images lyft sent me via email. 


update 3:

they responded saying they reviewed the evidence again and they won't be issuing a refund. (i wrote back before posting to reddit)

this time i was less friendly and asked what evidence they reviewed, for the original pictures, picture of the car before the damages, location and time of pictures. i mentioned other news articles of scams like this. i told them if i was not refunded  i would reach out to my cc (so i will get money anyways) (i have capital one btw cause idk if this is true lol) , post on all social media about their ""investigations"". i also asked for an invoice of the cleaning service. any thoughts? something i forgot to add? 

i will update once i have a response.

"don't ever feel pressured (young people especially) to spend more then you have to or want.. i'm 23 and graduated last year and was offered a full time position making decent money out of school. i've come to notice that ever since taking the job a lot of my peers constantly hint that i should be spending every dime i make on a new car, clothes, going out every weekend etc. at first i was pretty bad since i live alone am lucky enough to debt free and don't have any obligations outside of monthly bills which leaves me with decent amount of wiggle room. i'm usually left with around 500$ every month and instead of investing/saving i would spend most of that 500$ for the first while.  i've come to realize there's better places to put my money.

i've noticed that a lot of people my age have very short sighted goals when it comes to money. instead of taking that extra cash every month and investing in retirement, emergency fund etc. we tend to blow it on useless crap that we think will get us notoriety among our peers. there's probably a lot to blame for this mind set (social media etc etc.) that i won't get in to. not saying every millennial does this but it's something i've noticed through my friends, and just in general.

i'm definitely not saying don't treat yourself every once and while but 100$ a month spent on stuff you probably don't need versus 100$ a month in a savings or retirement account can go a long way. don't let peer pressure make you look back and wish you saved more!

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of great replies. i just want to stress that this isn't some attempt to make people feel bad for spending or try and say every young person has it the same. i am also not trying to demonize anyone i'm just talking from my perspective and my experiences for people who may be in the same boat or find themselves in a similar situation. especially in today's world where materialism is more and more prominent with social media you'd be crazy to not think that ""peer pressure"" i talk about isn't there even if its not directly stated by people around you.

"a tip for those of us that eat takeout on consistent basis.. a couple of months ago i was looking at my bank statements and each month i was spending about $200 on eating out. the first piece of advice i see when someone wants to pay off their debt is to cut back on expenses. eating out seems to be the main offender. 

i decided to take a different approach. every time i wanted to order take out, i took the amount of what my order would be and placed it into my savings. in the past couple of months i've saved a little under $200. this included everything from fancy burger places to dollar pizza. even little things like going to the store across the street to buy a can of soda. watching my savings grow has been really motivating me to cook at home more and stay away from junk food. i used to eat takeout at least twice a week and now i'm down to once or twice a month because of it.

---

edit: so i'm getting a lot of mixed feedback here and some are very valid. note that this is not something that works for everyone as everyone is under different circumstances but i do find that this works for a lot of people. this isn't a catch all by any means. for those of you calling it stupid, while thats your personal opinion, remember that different techniques work for different people. if eating takeout is more beneficial to you then that's great. this post is for those that want to save money but eat out regularly. personally, i think its helpful to see things on paper.

additionally i never said to stop eating out entirely. i understand the necessities of enjoying one's self for their mental and emotional well being. i will eat out every now and then especially if it's a special occasion. i'm talking about those of us who eat out multiple times a week. 

there are benefits to each, its just a matter of picking what's most important and sensible for you. 

to those that are saying that they don't want to eat boring/bland food learn how to use spices and herbs properly. ",10
"don't buy textbooks at college/university. after completing my 4 year degree, i purchased 4 books in semester one. i realised throughout the semester that i'd used the books maybe 3-4 times (typical student). the cost of the books, $300, didn't seem feasible. 
i looked into other avenues and found that the library has most books available for short (3-7 day loan). you can also scan a certain number of pages (i think it could be 10% - i'm in australia - check this to ensure you aren't doing it illegally) and just scan the select few you need at the time. i did this successfully throughout my degree and found it rather easy and no major effort at all!

by doing this, i spent approximately $50-100 for my remaining 7 semesters. in comparison, my colleagues spent $2500-3000 for the same educative experience.

for those books that you absolutely need, either borrow from a friend, or buy second hand. you can save hundreds, if not thousands this way also!

tl;dr - books expensive. borrow from library. paid $300 buying books sem 1. spent $50-100 for remaining 7 semesters through borrowing/scanning pages i needed (see above for legal issues - unsure if countries have different laws). colleagues spent $2500-3000 over the four years in comparison.",10
"the atlantic: two major credit ratings agencies have been lying to consumers. *a cfpb investigation concluded that transunion and equifax deceived americans about the reports they provided and the fees they charged.*  

*in their investigation, the bureau found that the two agencies had been misrepresenting the scores provided to consumers, telling them that the score reports they received were the same reports that lenders and businesses received, when, in fact, they were not. the investigation also found problems with the way the agencies advertised their products, using promotions that suggested that their credit reports were either free or cost only $1. according to the cfpb the agencies did not properly disclose that after a trial of seven to 30 days, individuals would be enrolled in a full-price subscription, which could total $16 or more per month. the bureau also found equifax to be in violation of the fair credit reporting act, which states that the agencies must provide one free report every 12 months made available at a central site. before viewing their free report, consumers were forced to view advertisements for equifax, which is prohibited by law.*

"i am being charged $400 for a person i don't know who claimed me as her guarantor.. so a few months back, my sister asked me to be her guarantor. i agreed. when i logged into the portal to sign the contract, i noticed she had also added me as the guarantor for one of her random ass friends she wanted to room with. after explaining to her how incredibly fucking stupid and unacceptable that was, i emphatically refused to sign her friend's contract. later, the apartments called me about the missing signature and i explained the situation and again refused to sign. 




fast forward to a few weeks ago, i get a bill in the mail from a debt collection agency. this is where i fucked up: i assumed i'd never hear from the other girl again, so i thought my sister was behind on her rent. she showed me proof that she wasn't so i figured they had sent this earlier, but that my sister had since paid. 



turns out the girl was being charged for a no show on her contract and they are treating me as the guarantor. neither the debt collection agency nor the apartments can show me documentation proving that anything was signed by me. but the debt collectors want an email from the apartments to clear me from the account. the apartments swear up and down that i signed, but somehow can't provide me with any proof.




according to the debt collector, it's been over 30 days, so if they don't get an email from the apartments within 48 hours, it'll affect my credit. i have zero expectation that the girl would pay it even if i could get in touch with her.



what can i do? how can i put pressure on the apartments to send that email? ",10
"$450,000 in debt. medical school grad with no job.. hello everyone. throwaway account here, hoping i can get some valuable advice regarding the situation i'm in...

i'm 29 y/o, recently graduated from medical school 2 years ago with $450,000 in student loans from both undergrad college and med school. 

now the way becoming a ""working"" physician in the us works is you apply once a year during september, interview for a couple months, then find out whether or not you got any job the following march. this is called being ""matched"" into a job called medical residency where you work as a junior doctor physician for 3 years inside a hospital and then you get to apply for a real doctor job thereafter. 

unfortunately for me, i did not match into residency twice in a row. i am honestly a below average student (low grades). upon requesting feedback from the people and directors that interviewed me, they said i was qualified, interviewed well, but my initial board scores although passing was just below average compared to everyone else. 

i decided to reapply for the next year's cycle.. during that time, i worked as an er scribe for minimum wage and unfortunately could not save up as i was living paycheck to paycheck while paying application fees, interview costs (flights, hotel, car rentals), etc. in regard to my student loans, i applied for repaye and qualified for $0/month on my loans, but am still accruing an insane amount of interest each day. 

fast forward a year, i ended up again not ""matching"" into a residency job again. at this point, i've almost completely given up and am seeking alternative career paths, but my parents convinced me to apply one last time. i moved back home (different state) to save on rent, sold pretty much most of my belongings, and am now unemployed. at this time i am studying for another medical board exam test that if i pass will hopefully show these hospitals that i may be qualified for their program. most of my friends and family say that with the half million dollar debt i am in, i have no choice but to work as a physician and keep trying to land a residency job as a junior doctor... with that said, i really don't know what to do now, financially speaking. i can keep reapplying year after year but then my loans would just keep increasing. to even make a dent on them, i would have to pay over $900 a month just to cover interest costs before even scratching the actual loan borrowed. i don't even have the money to pay for the application fees and another years worth of travel expenses so much of the costs will be unfortunately covered by my parents. i feel like a huge financial burden to them and even with their help, i am not sure how i will pay for the other expenses for this year's cycle while trying to pay back the interest on my loans.

the application season starts this september. my exam is next month in august. i will try to find a local clinical job nearby after to acquire any income, but i'm further concerned that i will never really get out of this debt and/or never become a working licensed physician. thank you for reading, i know i probably went all over the place so if i can clarify anything, let me know.

tl;dr $450,000 student loan debt. medical doctor degree with no job. living with parents.

update 1: oh wow, thanks for all the advice folks, i really appreciate your time. so a bit more info, i applied internal medicine during the first cycle, then family and internal med during second cycle. i graduated from a foreign medical school which i don't think i can disclose at this time. i think that the military route isn't open for foreign medical graduates even though i'm a us citizen. based on these replies, if the 3rd match cycle doesn't work out, i'll attempt to transition into a government job with pslf since that really is my only other option. with that said, i hope i didn't dissuade anyone from wanting to enter the medical field based on the situation i'm in. the majority of us-medical students match into a residency and have no problem so i believe they will be okay.

update 3/11/19: by the graces of god, i matched into residency. thanks for all of your support.

"if you can afford it, pay a little bit extra to get a lot of extra protection regarding car insurance.. my husband was rear ended in a car accident this week. at the scene, the at-fault driver presented an insurance card showing coverage through may. we thought everything would work out fine. 

as the week progressed, however, our insurance agent updated us on the truth behind the other driver. as it turns out, he was arrested after we left the scene. he had a warrant out for his arrest regarding a previous hit and run, he was driving on a suspended license, and the car wasn't his. the car belonged to his girlfriend, who had let the insurance lapse. we had been hit by an uninsured motorist. our car was totaled and my husband was accruing medical bills. for a few anxious moments, we thought we were looking at huge out of pocket expenses with little chance for reimbursement, given the character of the other driver and the fact that he was currently in jail. 

thankfully, we pay an extra $11.10 every 6 months as part of our insurance premium for uninsured motorist coverage. by opting into this additional coverage, we saved ourselves from the stress and impossibility of suing the other driver personally to be reimbursed for our damages. instead, our insurance will write us a check for our totaled car and pay our medical bills, and they will be the ones suing the other driver, not us. 

all for an extra $23 a year. 

edit: i'm being told that this reads like an ad, but i guarantee it isn't. i am a writer by profession, which might explain the tone of my narrative. plus, this happened on tuesday so it is all still very emotional and fresh in my mind. i'm very happy that this post has motivated people to learn more about their own policies and insurance coverage. 

edit 2: our cars are insured in oregon, so those are the state laws / minimums that apply to our situation. 

edit 3: also make sure your car seats are properly installed, and if a car seat is in the car when you're in an accident, know that you most likely need to replace it! car seats lose their effectiveness after a collision. we included our car seat in our claim and we will be reimbursed for a new one.

i called and spoke to a cs rep for the hospital and simply asked to work out a payment plan. she said i could pay a monthly amount for a year or pay in full right now and get a 20% discount! i was ready to leap out of my chair but thankfully composed myself and said, while i appreciate that offer is it possible you could do more. she said that is the most she could offer without manager approval. i asked if she would ask her manager. after a minute hold she came back with 30%!!!

i've been most successful the couple of times when i was able to lead crews or manage people but i either had to move for personal reasons or quit the job because they wanted me to move around too much. my current employer has made it very clear that once hired here i'm my department (industrial mechanic) there is no room for growth. that the only potential i have here is to be the best mechanic i can be. i'm not ok with that.

i really want to get away from manual labor and start anywhere really i just want the potential for a well payed position to be available to me provided i work hard and make intelligent decisions along the way. i see all the guys i work with now and they're beaten down, stressed and you can tell the years of this have been rough on them. i don't want to be that guy. i also workout a lot in my free time it's kind of my passion  and these physically demanding jobs really take away from that. i guess what i'm looking for is suggestions on where to start looking. i'm currently taking home $2,800 usd a month after taxes, 401k, insurance and all the other deductions. it's not a lot by any means but i've gotten comfortable with it. my previous jobs were closer to $2000 so i like making that little extra. 

ideally i'd like to be taking home 4k a month within the next 5 years but i can't do that here and i don't think i can within this industry. i would appreciate some advice on where i could start looking.

however, when we broached salary she stated there would be a ""adjustment,"" but wouldn't give specifics. i'm pretty certain she wanted me to commit to it before i even knew the salary. 

i told her i felt like i was worth high $60s, which is approximately 10% less than than the person in that role (which i quietly found out beforehand). i mentioned that i had a similar job offer from another company for around $60k that i turned down. and we'd be saving $13k on my replacement. so all in all should be at least $10k savings. but she wants to base it on a % bump from my current much lower salary, rather than what the job actually should pay. 

she instantly quit talking, almost like she felt betrayed by even asking for a higher salary. it's been awkward around the office for the 48 hours since.

"amazon seller fraudulently used my husband's ssn and now the irs wants us to pay taxes on income they generated selling.. we got a letter from the irs stating they had adjusted a previous year's tax return to reflect an amount of adjusted income reported and we now owed a huge amount of taxes and penalties.  this shocked us as we each have a single job and certainly no additional income on the side, much less enough to generate a tax burden in the tens of thousands. a couple phone calls revealed that my husband's ssn was fraudulently used in association with an amazon seller account that generated enough income to require tens of thousands in income tax owed.  we never sold a thing on amazon so this is an obvious case of identity theft / fraud.  so far the irs and amazon have not been exceedingly helpful and it seems the onus is all ours.  we'll take the obvious steps one should take when a victim of identity theft, but im curious if anyone has dealt with this before.  amazon is so prolific i can't imagine this hasn't happened before.

"$65k+, hate my life vs. $45k, happier. currently work in an exceptionally high pressure field as a manager and frontline customer service personal. very time sensitive and strict line of work with many different and demanding ""bosses""(customers, insurance partners, actual bosses) to appease. 

my workplace is a 70km round trip commute(which i loathe). i am essential personal and expected to man my post regardless of weather conditions or conflicts/complications in my personal life. in 10 years i have missed less than 10 days of work. 

monday to friday i leave my house at 6:30am and do not return until 6:30pm or later. frequently i am working beyond that, 12-14hrs a day if the work volume so demands. i often remote connect to my work conputer from home on the weekends and evenings. the workload is overwhealming as i am the only person in my workplace who handles the type of work i do. every customer, and every phonecall is more piled on to an already overflowing plate. 

generally speaking, i have a strong distain for my workplace, customers and employer. i feel totally burned out and complacent.

that being said, i have a salary of $65k+ with benefits, which from my limited perspective is pretty good.

i have an offer to move to a large multinational insurance company. the office is a 4km commute from my home, the hours are 8-4 and the workload would be a fraction of whats currently demanded of me. the only hang up im having is the $20k+ pay decrease i would face.

base salary for the position would be $42.5k with an increase to $45k(plus pension and benefits) after 6 months.

i know for my mental health the change would be a good thing, but i am so hung up about the salary disparity. 

i truely feel like a wage slave.

could anyone ring in with an outside perspective to aid in clearing my mind?

thanks pf community.

"some helpful information regarding medical insurance - based on 25 years experience. i worked for a blue cross affiliate for nearly three decades and frequently see questions here about medical insurance. i wanted to share some helpful tips about some common roadblocks people run into.

firstly, medical insurance has many,  many policies in place, but you have to ask for them.

* you visit the er and are seen  by an out of network doctor. you are shocked when the statement comes in and you have to pay much more than you expect. similarly, you have surgery with an in-network surgeon, but surprise surprise, the anesthesia doctor is out of network and the claim gets applied to your much larger, out of network deductible. this is known by many names - surprise billing, raps (radiologist/anesthesiologist/pathologists). if this happens do you, don't panic. call the number on your insurance card and explain to the rep that this particular scenario was out of your control and you are requesting that they process the claim under your in-network benefits. 99/100 times, they will agree and your share will hopefully be reduced significantly

* an offshoot of the above - if you are treated by a ""surprise"" provider, and your insurance does process the claim under your in-network benefits, you may find that the doctor bills you more than expected. for example - radiologist bills cigna $1000. they ""approve"" $500, pay 80% of that $500, and state that you share is 20% of that $500 ($100). but the bill comes and they are billing you your $100 share, plus the other $500 that the insurance ""ignored'. this is called ""balance bill"". and again, if you call your insurance and explain that this was out of your control ,and the doctor is not kind enough to accept the reduced rate that insurance calculated, 99/100 times they will recalculate the claim to approve the full $1000, and then assign the 20% as your share (or whatever your benefits happen to be).

* a big complaint around here is having some test, service or procedure that ends up not being covered by the plan. it could be because the plan simply does not cover it (cosmetic procedure), or perhaps they deem it experimental. so how are you supposed to know? every single blood test, scan, surgery, poke, and prod is assigned a unique five digit code known as a cpt code. they bill that code, along with other codes that describe your medical state. those are known as diagnosis codes. 99/100 times, a decide to either pay or deny a claim is based on a policy that involves looking at the combination of cpt and diagnosis code to determine if that is a covered service. that means that before you have anything done, you can ask the provider for those codes, then contact your insurance by email to get confirmation that those codes, when billed together, are covered. i say by email, so that you have it in writing if there is a problem down the road. there are *some* cpt codes that have very rare coverage, so even with a diagnosis code, they may not be able to definitively say yes or  no. in those cases, the doctor can send them your full medical records and ask for a pre-determination. basically saying, if we were to bill you a claim with these codes, and this medical history, would you pay or deny. they will send a response letter letting you know.

* pricing is all over the place. if you are lucky to have a plan that just charges copays for everything, this does not really apply to you. but if you are like most people and have a large deductible, the negotiated rate for a specific service can make a huge difference. if you need an mri, there could be 5 in-network facilities in your area and the range of negotiated rates can run from $450 for a private, mri facility, to $4500 for large university hospital. you can call your insurance with the cpt code for the test you are having and ask them to supply you with the negotiated rates for a few facilities in your area. many insurers now offer this pricing tool when you log into your insurers website.

* many insurers are recognizing that keeping customers happy is good for business. they are starting to create programs to erase the old image that insurance companies just want to deny everything. for example, aetna has a program that (**if** you ask,) will reprocess a claim to an out of network provider, to your in-network benefits, once per year. see this link for a full description of the program: https://www.crnstone.com/news/service-without-borders/

* you have appeal rights. depending on your plan, you can have 2-3 attempts to appeal, so even if you are not lucky the first time around, you can try again. after you have used up all attempts, many plans let you ask for an external review, where a 3rd party reviews everything and makes a non biased decision. by the way, since you have a fixed number of appeal rights, usually 1-3, make sure each one counts. don't call up cigna and say ""i dont agree with this copay, i want to appeal"". you just wasted an appeal because what exactly did you give them to review other than your dissatisfaction?

i will try  to answer any other questions that pop up regarding medical insurance so feel free to post here. 


**edit** - i am so glad this has gotten popular. i really hope this advice can help someone. a few more tips:

* i cannot say enough good things about goodrx. run your prescriptions and compare prices. firstly, you will see that there can be a huge range of prices between cvs, walgreens, walmart etc. also, you may find a price that is even lower than your insurance company's negotiated rate. if the difference is large enough, it may make sense to just use the coupon, instead of your insurance. the only downside is that you won't get credit towards your deductible. but saving a large amount of money may be worth it.

* always, always check with your insurance to make sure a particular doctor is in-network *at the particular location, with the particular tax id#*. i cannot count how many times someone got screwed over because a doctor was in-network but they saw him at a location that was not. and never rely on the doctor's office to know the details about *your* plan. they manage 3,000 patients accross 25 different plans. and doctor's office are more than glad to tell you ""we take your insurance*. what that can often mean is ""sure, we will physically **take** your insurance card and bill them, but are we in-network? absolutely not!""",10
"my husband and i are idiots. we've been bamboozled by a financial advisor.. ugh i'm so frustrated. i thought we were doing a good thing for ourselves but now i think we are trapped.

full backstory: a friend recommended their ""financial advisor"" to us. we thought ""great! we've been meaning to meet with someone... we have a kid on the way and husband isn't putting away anything towards retirement since starting his new job in august"". 

so we set up phone meeting with his friend from northwestern mutual. she gives us a call, and we end up speaking with her for over an hour. she asks us lots of questions- what we are looking for (we tell her we want to set up retirement stuff for husband and explore maybe putting some of our 17k in savings into cd's or mutual funds). she asks us questions about when we see ourselves retiring, how ""aggressive"" we are, etc. all good stuff. we hang up and agree to talk again in a week when she will give us a plan.

cut to a week later, we are having a phone meeting with her and she emails me the plan. it's many many pages basically explaining what we have vs. what we will need if we want to retire.  but she mostly just talks about how we need more life insurance. ""sure"" we think. maybe we do need more life insurance. she explains that husband needs at least $1mill in life insurance and i need $500k (we both already have $150k policies through work on ourselves). this is news to us but we hear her out. she also spends a ton of time explaining how we need to have disability insurance. again, we think ""maybe we do"". so we spend the greater part of an hour and a half talking about life insurance and long term disability insurance. she briefly mentions we should be maxing out my roth ira and we could perhaps start one for husband. so we hang up, with plans to talk again in a week and sign some paperwork.

over the next week, husband and i really realize that we don't want disability insurance (she quoted us paying like $170/month) and we didn't really feel we needed more life insurance at this time (she had us paying $340/month in permanent and $125/month in term). but we were ok maxing out my roth at $450/month. we also wanted to explore stocks/bonds/cd's/mutual funds more (like we initially told her). so i sent this all to her in an email before our next meeting. she sends back ""ok, great! sounds good.. talk soon"".

cut to another phone meeting, where she would talk with us about our updated plan. she emails us the new plan while we are on the phone. literally nothing is changed. she proceeds to spend the next hour convincing us why we need life insurance and disability insurance. husband and i are both pushovers and listen to the whole schpeel again. every time we bring up a reason why we don't feel like we need it, she tells us how we are wrong. i mean, she's the professional, we thought. i still expressed my disinterest in disability insurance but wasn't completely closing the door on life insurance. she kept giving me the guilt trip on ""what will your kids have if one of you dies!"". by the end of the conversation, i hadn't agreed to anything except to roll over my roth to northwestern. she had me give her my bank routing info to get ""the paperwork started"". she also said she was going to be sending me a bunch of stuff to sign in the next few weeks, but it was just to apply for things... nothing was set in stone. we could just see what the insurance company was going to quote us at, and we still aren't committed to anything. ""ugh fine"" i think. she says a small amount might be taken out of my checking, but its just to make sure ""the charges are able to go through when we start moving more money to my roth"".

so a week or two goes by. and i see a ~$30 charge go through for ""disability insurance"". which i told her i didn't want!! and i just realize... this doesn't feel good. it doesn't seem right. she's not listening to what we want. she still hasn't addressed out interest in cd/mutual funds/stocks that we initially came to her for. i spend the weekend doing my due diligence- spending a few hours on r/personalfinance, nerdwallet, just googling in general about what husband and i should really be doing. i decide to call the whole thing off with northwestern.

it's been a nightmare trying to cut off ties with her. i was kind and courteous through the first couple emails and subsequent texts ""we really appreciate your time but have decided to pull out. again, thank you"". 

she is being evasive and manipulative. telling us we are completely wrong and we still need to work with her. at this point i have just ignored any further communication. it has just been a really bad experience. 


but the real reason i still feel like i can't completely ignore her, is that i asked her several times when i should expect to see a refund for the disability insurance that i did not want and did not agree to. she just dances around the question. i'm also worried because i have gotten a ""bill"" (no charges yet) in the mail for the $340/month in permanent and $125/month in term and $170 in short term disability. 

is there anything i can do to make sure i don't get charged this? if i communicate with her any farther, she just tries to talk to us about why we need to invest with her, etc. 

what do we do. she is being shady af.  ",10
"over a year after it was disclosed, the experian site will still give your credit freeze pin to anyone that knows your ssn and dob. i froze my credit after the equifax breach, but have had to lift it a few times since then.  when freezes became free i wanted to confirm that my credit was frozen with each bureau.  when i got to the experian site, i went through the process of adding a new freeze, and when it asked for a pin i put in the existing pin i had.  the confirmation page said something along the lines of ""you already have a freeze, and the pin is 123456"".

i was slightly worried and so repeated the process in a new incognito browser window and when it asked if i wanted to enter a pin or have them generate one i let them generate it.  i got the same confirmation/error page with my current pin displayed.  to be clear, the second time i did this, all i provided was name, address, ssn, and dob.  i did not provide the pin.  i did have to answer some of those security questions you tend to have to answer when confirming your identity online (eg, ""what bank is your home mortgage with?""), but the entire point of the credit freeze is to prevent people who may have that type of information from opening new credit.

i wanted to warn people, that while the credit freeze is a still a good idea, it's not iron clad.  it would also be nice if there was some pressure on experian to change this.  i googled to see if this was already documented, and was shocked to see this article from over a year ago outlining the exact same process working the same way.

"you will never get paid what your work is valued at unless you ask (i'm a business owner). i have read many posts on here about people complaining that they're aren't paid enough, just found out they aren't paid as well as others at their company, or are verbally told they are getting a raise but never get it in writing.

i own a business and employ over 50 people. i can tell you straight up that payroll is my biggest controllable expense and if i can pay someone less and stay in business, i am going to try that. i also know that if i don't pay enough, i will lose high quality staff. it's a juggling act. how much can i pay so they feel like i'm paying them well while trying to hold back enough money to pay the bills and save some money for a rainy day? it's different with every hire. if someone asks for a raise, they better show me why they deserve it. i'll also weigh that decision with the marketplace and how easily i can replace them. some jobs aren't meant to make much, others should make more. 

i pay my staff well enough that i experience low turnover. i have competitors who don't. i chose this as part of my business model. it works for me but not everyone.

if you want a raise, ask for it, but realize you're taking a risk of being told no. give clear reasons why. have a back up plan in place if you don't get what you want. get it in writing.

and if you think you should be making more then interview and take that new job, because odds are, you won't get the kind of pay increase you're looking for unless you leave.",10
"another driver hit my car. their insurance won't pay or return my calls.. as the title states, my parked car was hit by a guy backing out of his driveway at the end of september. right after the accident, i called the police, got an accident report, and the other driver admitted fault. i submitted a claim with his insurance, got a letter stating my claim was in process...and i haven't been able to get anything else from them since. i have spoken to their higher ups, left hundreds of messages, and nothing happens. no updates, no one who answers will give me any information, nothing.

i think i am at the point where i need to file with my insurance to get my car fixed, but i wanted to see if there are any other steps i can or should take. is getting money from the other driver's shitty insurance company a lost cause? will my insurance go after them? do i get a lawyer involved?

thanks in advance everyone.

update: thanks for taking the time to give me advice everyone. i just filed with my insurance company to get this going.

update: great feedback, reddit. thanks for all taking time to reply. this was my first accident and i feel like i am now much more prepared to handle this. for others like me, go ahead and file with your own insurance, especially if the offending party's insurance is unresponsive. there is no good faith with these people, even with a straight forward accident with a police report. this should be illegal, but it isn't. my insurance has already scheduled repairs at the body shop of my choice and is going after the other party/company. i will check my rates but have been assured they won't go up as i wasn't at fault or even in the vehicle. again, thanks everyone. you people are great.",10
"i just got fired: the importance of savings. hey guys.

i was literally fired less than hour ago, and this subreddit is the first ""person"" i'm telling.

i just want to point out how incredibly important savings are. i am 24, and this was my first real job. i am fortunate to have saved $5,000 in savings (enough for about 4 to 5 months expenses) and that isnt even considering unemployment and my last check. 

this is a huge reason why i didn't cry when i was fired lol. it didn't feel like my livlihood was gone.

"never hurts to ask. put in my notice, got a 10k raise.. so brother in law has brain cancer and has about 2-5 yrs to live but won't be able to work.  his motor skills havr taken a step back.  my sister is in mri tech school full time and they have 3 kids.  the family is stepping up to help, but the hospital bills, and daycare, etc. is mounting.
i am helping her out, but i began looking for a better paying job to help out even more.  i want the kids to have food, clothes, bithdays, and be as normal as possible.  
had some interviews and got an offer for 10k more than my current job.  i accepted.  
the company i work for is doing so so and budget is tight, so i never even thought of asking for more money.
went to turn in my notice and the director asked if he matched would i stay.  i was baffled, but of course i would.
he got the match, i will be able to send more to my sister, and i don't have to start a new job with a weird shift.
he also had many words of praise about my work and said although budget is tight they want to keep the good people.
made my day, weekend, month.
lesson learned on asking for a raise.  it never hurts to try.

edit:  wow!  a ton of great stories, encouragment, and opinions.  thank you all?
a little more background.  i did get an offer letter for the raise.
the cio brought me in to her office and said she normally never saves people from leaving for the very reasons many of you have expressed (if more money comes they will leave eventually anyways), but they love work and my attitude and it was a no-brainer for her.  
some of you may say she is just saying that, and you could be right, but we had a heart to heart and talked about people we had lost and people we know who currently have a terminal illness.
will i retire from here?  no.  i am a gen xer(35) and like to move jobs every 2-3 years to keep things fresh.
does their gesture make me want to more for them? yes.
i am in it, and live in mn.  it jobs are everywhere and pay well.  they know this yet gave the raise anyways.

edit 2:  
thanks for all the support.  lots of good conversation from those in the same boat.  some have been burned, others had it worked out for them.  i hope to be in the latter group and feel that i am.  time will tell.
as for my brother in law and sister, it's a long road ahead.  the guy is so young (39). embrace every moment folks. tell everyone you care about that you care about them.  go on adventures.  live life.  become a vikings fan!

"$0.00 bill sent to collections, they added $15 ""interest"". this is a follow-up of sorts to my previous post where i thought everything had been resolved(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7hqaen/employer_recently_changed_providers_and_i/).

in yesterday's mail i received a collection notice from grant mercantile agency (is id'ing them by name okay? i'll remove their name if mods disapprove) showing a principal amount of $0.00, because i'd paid the bill in full in june, but with interest of $15.38. so the collection agency is claiming i ***currently*** owe them $15.38. (""because of interest and other charges that may vary from day to day, the amount due on the day you pay may be greater."")

i immediately called the radiology center where i'd paid the bill in june but their a/r people had already left for the day, so i got a/r's direct number and am planning to call them this morning.

i'm hoping a/r will call the collection agency (ca) and tell them to knock it off.

but it's also entirely possible that this is something i may need to do myself.

so, that's the question.

if i do have to call the ca myself and **if** they're ***not*** willing to acknowledge that this is clearly a computer error and just zero out the account, how do i fight this? what do i tell them? *other* than ""fuck off, you shady cunts"". because that would not only *not* be polite but counterproductive as well.

and i'm certainly **not** paying interest on a bill that i've already paid in full.

***update:***  i just spoke to a/r, told them the ca was charging me $15 interest on a $0.00 bill, and they agreed that that's not right. they're going to send me a $0.00 statement, and said they will also contact the ca to let them know the account has been settled. i guess i'll have to wait to see if the ca is willing to play ball, or if they'll still try to get a slice of my pie.

***2nd update:*** a couple of hours have passed and i decided to call the ca myself. with all the bad rep cas get, the lady i spoke to was very polite, friendly, nice, etc. she looked up my account, told me it had been zeroed out, and that i did not owe them a penny. she also assured me that the debt had ***not*** been reported to the credit reporting agencies, then reassured me a second time that it would not be. yes, she actually said it twice, that it ***has not*** been reported and ***will not*** be reported to them.

due to the security snafu with experian we have their ""pro"" service for a year (or however long it is) so when i get home tonight i should be able to pull my credit report with them for free, regardless of the ""one free report per year"" caveat.",10
"hr pulled me to demand proof of a degree i never claimed to have, (they knew i only had a hs diploma) and now they want to cut my pay.. my hr at the company i work for contacted me telling me they did an internal audit and found i have no proof of degree on file for my position that 'requires a degree'. that's true because i never got my degree and said as much on my application and in my interview, in fact during my orientation they asked if i could provide a copy of my degree to which i said i have none just a hs diploma and they said that would suffice. all has been good for 3 years.

well now they're changing tune and want to reduce my pay by $5/hr. the kicker is, there are others within my dept that don't have degrees and they didn't get audited so their pay remains unchanged.

i know an employer can reduce pay whenever and for whatever reason they want. my question is can they do it using a reason such as not having a degree but applying that condition selectively and allowing others to be untouched, and can they fire me with cause if i don't accept the pay cut that happens to only target me?

any help would greatly be appreciated as i've scoured google to not much avail.

"update my mom didn't pay taxes. the state is going to take money from the joint account she opened for me when i was a minor that only i use. can i do anything?. my original post is here!(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4k66ag/my_mom_didnt_pay_taxes_the_state_is_going_to_take/).

as a reminder, unbeknownst to me, my mom didn't pay her taxes so the bank sent me a notice that the tax board was about to take money from our joint account, which is really my account that she never ever uses, and her name is only on it because it was opened when i was a minor (although i no longer am a minor).

good news!  i ended up calling the tax board several times, and they were actually extremely helpful once i got a hold of a real live person.  in the end, they had me fax them my information, a pay stub, and 3 bank statements from the last three months, proving that i was the only one who used the account.  afterwards,  they removed the order to levy my account.

i have since withdrawn the money from that account and put it into my own account.  problem solved. 

thank you for everyone's help and advice on this.  

edit: for those who are wondering, my mom will be ok.  i talked to her and convinced her to face her taxes rather than continue to put it off.  she was very very sorry.  she started a payment plan june 1 with the tax board.  whether she follows it and stays with it is up to her. ",10
"verizon applied neighbor's significantly past due debts to my account. my current 2 year contract was about to expire so i called verizon to change it.  i was told i could not change a thing because there was a credit hold on my account.  i am a 30 year customer with a perfect payment record so i was shocked when i was told i owe verizon more than $2,000.  it took a 2+ hour phone call, multiple transfers and several 3 way conversations, until one customer service rep took charge and refused to give up.  this customer service rep, after multiple tries, finally found  someone in the verizon credit department who was willing to listen to common sense and correct my account.  my townhouse community's addresses are similar to apartment buildings,  one overall street address per court then each townhome is assigned a unique unit number.  my neighbor has the same ""common"" first name as me and the first 3 letters of our last names match (only 3 out of 9 for me).  the credit department rep told me that verizon's fraud monitoring system used this minor name similarity to automatically assign my neighbor's outstanding accounts to me.  it did not matter that my neighbor's outstanding accounts had different full last names, account numbers, unit numbers, phone numbers, ssn, etc. my fear is at the end of the conversation the credit department rep. said this could easily happen again because a ""computer"" did the initial assignment.  my questions are.  is this even legal?  is there anything i can do and/or anyone i can contact to prevent this from happening again?

&#x200b;

**update:**   to answer some questions i am receiving and what suggestions i took so far

i did check my credit report while on hold and it was ok.  i plan to keep a good eye on it now.

verizon used to be bell atlantic which provided copper wire phone service so that is why i have been a customer for 30 years.

i was lucking that ssn's were required because the credit representative asked for my last four numbers as final proof that the other accounts were not mine.  they had a different ssn.

thanks to a link provided in the comments i emailed what happened to two senior executives.  i got an auto reply from one saying they just retired and use this link for making contact.  i went to that page and filled out an on-line form sending it to another senior executive.  i doubt i will get a response but will update this post if i do.

in both the email and online form i highly commended the csr who was determined to get my account fixed.

&#x200b;

**update 2**:  i'm shocked,  a person from verizon's executive relations office called me and left me a message saying they are so sorry for what happened to me.  they were happy a csr did finally help me and they will be notifying their manager about my positive feedback and compensation.  finally they left a phone number and asked me to call them back tomorrow so they can talk to me about my experience.  i will update this post again after this phone call.  personally,  i give verizon credit for responding to my email so quickly.

&#x200b;

**update 3**,  before i report on my conversation with the ""executive csr"", i wanted to add more detail on what happened, i think it is relevant now.

i called verizon support to update my plan that was about to expire.  the initial csr began to make the changes i wanted then told me they could not because i had a credit hold on my account.  i asked why, i always paid my bills but the csr had no idea.    this csr then contacted the credit department and we had a 3 way conference call.  the credit rep. was no help at all, she said i could not change anything on my account and i could have my services cut because of the amount of money i owe.   i told her that i have never seen these charges on my account, on-line and never received a bill for them.  she did not care.   then whenever i tried to ask a question  she kept repeating i had only 3 choices, pay the money, contact the billing office or something else (i forgot what this was).  i kept asking her where did these charges come from but she would only respond with those 3 choices.  i asked her to review my account and i kept getting the same response.  then she accused me of not listening to her and interrupting her.  finally i got so frustrated i had the csr forward me to the billing department.  while on hold with the billing department i got cut off.  i called back and finally got someone from the billing department.  this person could not help me but then conferenced in a gentleman from some department who would at least answer my questions on what the charges were.  he gave me the account numbers, the amounts, the years (2003 and 2012) and the address associated with the accounts.  but neither the billing rep. or this gentleman could remove my credit hold.  i was then transferred to the fraud department.  the fraud department asked if i had my identity stolen and if i thought my neighbor did this to me and i said no.  then they said they could not help me because it was not fraud.  i was again transferred back to billing who could still not help me so i was transferred back to a new csr.  this csr listened to me,  looked up all the accounts, and immediately said it was common sense that i was not responsible for these charges.  he said he could clear this up quickly but was unfortunately over optimistic.  he then called the credit department and got the same credit rep. i originally talked to, she gave him the same answers she gave me previously and refused to help.    then the csr got his supervisor involved and that did not help,  then i think he even went higher up the management chain trying to figure out how to help me.  the csr kept assuring me he will get this solved but was obviously getting frustrated.  then he and his managers decided to call the credit department back hoping they would get someone else other then the rep. we previously dealt with.  luckily he did and again i was involved in a 3 way conference call.  this credit rep asked me a few questions and the final one was, what is the last four of my ssn.  once i said it i was finally believed and the credit hold was removed.  but that is when i was told this could happened again and the first credit rep was just following company policies and procedures.

&#x200b;

**my conversation with the executive customer service representative:**

i got another apology and was again told that the csr's manager was notified about my compliments.    my case will be sent to the fraud department for review but she could not assure me that this would not happen again.  she said  that what happened to me was very rare.  i did not agree with this but i said what really bothered me about this whole situation was i was treated like i was automatically guilty of fraud and if the initial credit rep. just looked at the accounts and used common sense this could of been cleared up quickly.   i was told they have standard policies and procedures that must be followed.

i then explained in detail everything that occurred, which i explained above.  none of this seemed to matter.

i then asked if this hold could affect my credit reports and was told no because they only report to credit bureaus when accounts are closed,  this reporting is done by ssn, and the outstanding accounts had different ssns.

i then asked if what happened could be added to my account and was told it could not be added directly to my main account but was added to my credit account,  but i said since the credit department was the department that was the least helpful and they found me guilty immediately, i do not have any confidence they would help me in the future if this happened again.  i then got the standard answer they have policies and procedures they have to follow.

i then asked her to send me an email documenting everything she said and asked if i could contact her directly if this happened again and i was told no for both requests. i would have to follow verizon's standard policies and procedures and call the normal customer service line initially.  and at one point during the conversation she began to imply that the csr who finally helped me could of done better if they followed their standard policies and procedures.  in no way did i believe this and i did not want to get this csr in any trouble so that is when i moved to end this conversation.  basically, this conversation only made me more angry.

**my next step**:  i really like verizon's services, i previously had both direct tv and comcast and i never want to go back to them.  this was the first time in 30 years i ever had any issue with verizon, even though i was not very unhappy with what happened,  i plan to stay with verizon for now but keep all my documentation, emails and continue to check my credit reports periodically.

**finally**:  i was shocked this went viral, sorry for the length of this update, and i want to thank everyone for your assistance.

&#x200b;

**wait....the executive customer service representative just called me back:**  she was just notified that the fraud department has permanently disassociated my account with 3 other outstanding accounts.  it looks like there was even another account on top of the two i knew about.  i asked for an email documenting this and was told yes.  i did get the email

"near the limit on your credit card? if you can afford the minimum payment this month, make the same payment next month, not the new minimum payment.. **just as an example, if you have:** 

- a $5,000 balance on a credit card 

- with a 20% interest rate, then

- paying just the minimum (let's say 3% of the balance, which is $150 for the first payment), 

- **it would take 183 months (that's 14 years) to pay off the card, and you'd pay $5,601.51 in interest alone.**

*this is because the minimum payment goes downs as the balance goes down.*  this is what the banks are hoping you will do!!

so after making the first payment of $150, your next minimum payment is $148, then $146 in month 3, etc.

**but, if you just keep a constant payment of $150, you'll pay off the card in 48 months and spend $2,164 in interest.**

**this will shave over 11 years off the time it takes to repay the card, and save you $3,437.51 in interest.**

*paying even a small amount over the minimum payment each month goes a long way.*

more examples:

paying $175/month ($25 extra) cuts your payments down to 39 months and saves you $3,914.51 in interest.

paying $200/month ($50 extra) cuts your payments down to 32 months and saves you $4,226.51 in interest.

**i know you hear this time and again here in pf, but paying the minimum payments is a lifetime debt sentence.**

*and paying extra each month gives you an emotional ""win"" that will help you keep moving forward.*

**of course, in a perfect world, no one would carry a balance on their credit cards, and would only use them to get cash back rewards and travel points and airline miles and a date with olivia munn**, but this post is geared towards people who are facing high balances already, and to show them that you can make serious progress by implementing one or two good strategies.

thanks to everyone who upvoted, and especially to those who responded.  someone sent me a screenshot that this was on the reddit front page last night, which i definitely didn't see coming since there isn't a video of a cat singing ""you've got a friend in me"" to a baby sloth anywhere in this thread. but seriously, this will brighten your day(https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5pv7tj/dad_and_4yearold_daughter_duet_youve_got_a_friend/).

**i can't emphasize enough (and i know it's stickied right below this post), how important it is to read 
""how to handle $""(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)**

**95% of what the average person needs to know is right there on that page.**
and while a lot of it seems like common knowledge (as dozens of you have pointed out), for some people who were never guided properly in how to handle their financial life - it just isn't.
in my opinion, just like personal relationships, personal finance is a very complex issue that often has rather simple solutions - you just have to see them, and then make the effort.
*let's try to keep supporting each other - and reserve judgment whenever we can*.  ***you don't know what other people are going through***, and comments like, ""u r all dumb i pay my cards every month and if u don't u need a brain transplant"" aren't helping anyone.

this is only one of many strategies that can be used to tackle debt, and it is only an example.  in order to draw up the example, i had to pick some numbers, such as the balance, the apr, and the minimum payment %.  this example is actually not nearly as heinous as many credit cards out there, which have minimum payments that are much lower than 3%, and all but trap you in a cycle of paying *just enough* to keep you card right near the limit.

in those examples 14 years looks like no time at all.

here are the online calculators i used to find these numbers:

minimum payment calculator(http://www.creditcards.com/calculators/minimum-payment.php)

snowball calculator(http://www.whatsthecost.com/snowball.aspx)

i encourage you to plug in your numbers and see how they change based on different payments.",10
"just discovered my credit card's ""cash back"" program. is it really just free money? i find it too good to be true.. i was paying my credit card bill online and i found a link on the bank of america website said i had unredeemed cash rewards, several hundred dollars. i had never noticed this before. it gave me a few options for how to redeem it, it said they could send me a personal check in the mail or i could deposit this money directly into my savings account with the bank. it says i get 1% cash back for every purchase i make, and 2-3% for certain purchases.

is this really how it works? i get paid a small bonus every time i spend money using my credit card? and it's just free money no strings attached? 

i was always taught if it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true. i suppose it's not that much money, because i think these hundreds of dollars were earned over like five years since i first got this credit card. still, what's the angle here?

"psa: your doctor does not know what is not covered. do not rely on them for billing questions.. i work for a medical group and we see this quite a bit.  the physician will say one thing and then the patient finds out that it isn't covered and health insurance nightmares quickly ensue. 

your physician is not familiar with your insurance plan and what they may or may not cover.  they have a pretty good idea but when it comes down to healthcare and non-price transparent services please always use caution.  you will be the one paying not them.

there are several ways to go about this.  #1, which your physicians office sometimes will do, is get a pre-certification or a pre-authorization.  this is basically them calling the insurance and saying we're going to do x and we want to know it's covered.  insurance will give them some sort of documentation and then you can generally expect that service to be covered.  

 #2 you can call your insurance company and inquire.  please be advised this is not full proof and they will not hold their people responsible for telling you the wrong thing.  please default to #1 above if in doubt.

for our medicare patients; if you ever get an abn or advanced beneficiary notice they are telling you that whatever you are doing or having done is not covered.  please be aware of this.

"am i insane for thinking about taking 3-4 unpaid months off to travel?. background: 25 years old, living in the northeast us. recently paid off $50k in student loans and now completely debt free. around $75k saved for retirement and $10k liquid.

i'm thinking about leaving my current stressful but well-paid job at a tech company in a few months and finding an opportunity abroad on workaway or helpx. the plan would be to work on a farm or in a hostel abroad (europe or south america) for a couple months then returning to the states to dive back in with another company. 

my expenses would be around $1000/mo during this period but i wouldn't be able to save as aggressively as i have been doing. still, i think it would be an extremely fulfilling experience. i currently rent so i'd do this at the end of my lease, don't have a car to unload, and have been trimming down on possessions so i could easily keep my belongings with family while i'm away. i'm also a dual citizen (us/nl) and could legally work in europe for this period.

is this something that's worth pursuing or just reckless? has anyone here has experience doing something similar?

"almost got duped by a crafty scam, wanted to share to prevent others from falling for it.. i was in las vegas this past weekend and stayed at a no-name hotel slightly off the strip to save some cash.  it had good reviews and was basic, but was clean and got the job done.

sunday morning at 10:30 my hotel phone rings and it's the manager letting me know their computer system is down at the moment.  check out is at 11am so we were already packing and getting ready to leave despite our hangovers.

he let's me know that because the system is down they're a few hours behind on recovering data.  he confirmed my room number and offered me an extended checkout (which sounded great from the hangover) and also offered to comp our least expensive night's stay for the inconvenience.

he mentioned there were 30+ people in the checkout line and offered to check me out via the phone and said i could leave my keys as i left.  he asked me to confirm my credit card number and i got a little hesitant and said i would feel more comfortable providing that in person.

he got a little defensive and reiterated who he was and why he was trying to save time.  i still declined and went down to the front desk.  turns out, it was a scam and they were randomly dialing hotel rooms to get cc numbers and personal info.

they were super accommodating with their offer and because my hotel phone didn't have a caller id, it was very convincing.  stay safe out there and never be afraid to say no until you know who you're sharing you're information with!

tl:dr - someone called my hotel room pretending to be the manager and said their system was down and wanted my info including credit card to confirm and reimburse me for the trouble.  was a total scam and tough to trace, be careful!",10

"in case you have a small car accident and the person at fault refuses all contact. tl;dr it is possible your state's insurance commission can help get things moving with an insurance agency whose client is refusing contact.

a woman bumped into my 1-year-old honda van at a stoplight. the screw head on her front license plate made a neat if disconcerting hexagonal-shaped hole in the plastic bumper, otherwise the resulting scrape might not have been anything to have repaired. but i didn't want a hole in my bumper.

we exchanged information. based on anectdotal evidence from past experience, i didn't call the police for this extremely minor problem. i still think i was right not to bother them with it.

i had the bumper looked at; it was going to cost $500-$800 to take the bumper off, repair the hole, paint the bumper, and put it back on. and i would need to leave the van with them 2-3 days, since paint had to dry, etc.

i told the woman who hit me, and offered to let her pay for it instead of involving the insurance company; i didn't care which way she did this, and believe that her premiums would almost certainly go up at least the amount of the repair. she said she didn't have $800, and that she would get in touch with her insurance company.

i didn't hear anything for a week or so, tried to call her back, got no answer. tried from my home phone (which number she did not have) and she did answer, sounded disconcerted to realize it was me, said she had contacted her insurance company, they would be getting in touch.

waited a few more days; she did not answer calls from either number, and did not return messages.

i called my insurance company; they said my insurance would cover it if i cared to make a claim there, but that i could also just open a claim with her insurance company. so i called and did that; the person i talked with said they had no record of the accident, took the information, and said they would contact her and get back in touch.

another week; the insurance company says they have not been able to get in touch with the insured.

another week and a half, same thing. either something catastrophic has happened to her or she's avoiding talking with both the insurance company and me. i asked the insurance company what they intended to do about it, they said they have to talk to their insured before they can do anything. how convenient.

my wife suggests i talk to the state insurance commission; in nc, where we are, this is a state agency that regulates the insurance companies here. so i called and explained what was going on; they said they couldn't help much in terms of getting things moving unless 30 days passed from the time i opened the claim without any action on their part. there is a regulation, you see, that they have to respond to the claim in 30 days.

so at 30 days + 1 i call the commission again to let them know the insurance company took my claim over 30 days previous and has not offered any information, let alone resolution, since then. the next morning, the insurance company called (was it my imagination they were being much more solicitous?) and said they were accepting responsibility, let's set up an appointment with one of our adjusters, etc. appointment was made and kept, damage assessed, check cut, all within a few days. i could have gotten a rental as well, but had access to a car to borrow and decided against it.

i'm sorry for this woman who drifted into my car and doesn't have $800; i could have been much more accomodating if she had just worked with me. but i wanted pf to know that state agencies can be a help when it seems the normal commercial methods of things break down.

edit/addendum: why i didn't file with my own insurance. in my experience (i've lived in nc almost all my life), any claim made through your insurance company allows them to raise your rates. it doesn't have to make sense, it doesn't have to be your fault, it doesn't have to be substantial. i did call my insurance company for advice (after being told i couldn't talk to my agent, this company wants people to talk with them directly), and was told that of course i could file a claim, they would take care of everything and then contact the other insurance company to get reimbursed. but when i asked whether this would raise my rates, they couldn't tell me. it is, according to them, not *possible* to inform me whether this or any other action will raise my rates. this fact alone made me disinclined to deal with them over something this minor, since it leaves it entirely up to them whether to raise my rates, and there will likely be nothing i can do about it.

edit/addendum: why i had it repaired. there is certainly a little vanity involved. we buy cars new and drive them until the costs of their repairs makes it economical to buy another. so our other car is a 2003 camry with over 200k, and i hope to drive it a while longer yet. yes, the hole in the bumper is a small thing, but it is a thing, i don't know whether rainwater would get in it or what it would do if it did, i didn't cause the damn hole, i wanted it fixed. i don't think this has anything to do with high insurance rates, except to the extent that it costs so much to fix, which is not my fault. insurance companies don't charge based on what things cost them, they charge based on what they can get away with. that's why they're so rich.

edit/addendum: why i didn't call the police. i thought at the time that there was a minimum amount for which one is required to call the police; i personally think that, if you aren't required to and there's no other reason to, that they have more important things to do. i've looked up that info since, and there seems to be a requirement to call if the damage is more than $1000. i don't know how lay people are supposed to judge that, given that this repair was estimated at $500-$800 and actually came in for about $500.",10
"couple of tips that went a long way for me, financially.. so i was in the shower, pondering life's mysteries and throwing out some comebacks to my school bullies 4 years too late, when i began to start thinking about the positive changes i've made financially. they saved my ass a couple of times, and so i wanted to share. 

i. the saving accounts. 

- get a saving account with interest. period. i use discover for a cashback debit and a savings account. shop around for one that best suits you.

- some people still don't know you can have more than one dedicated savings account. if you don't know, now you know. you can get creative with these hoes, too. i had one dedicated to 3x rent, utilities, and groceries. 
i say have a minimum of 2x, but if you can add more, add more. 

- i had another one dedicated to emergencies. i have $4.5k in there. this covers car problems, anything my insurance doesn't cover, hotels, food... you get the idea. much like everything else, your goal will and should depend on your financial situation. again, add more if you can. always. 

- if you can, have a ""fun times"" account. 
i, at my core, am a materialistic motherfucker. i love watches, cars, clothes...everything. but, i refrain from living like one, because i've developed discipline over the years. however, i'm also in a position where i can throw in money into a more ""flexible"" account like this, so i do. this gets last priority. if i have any money left after r/u/g and my emergency account, then i'll throw it in this guy. 

ii. the talk. 

*you* know *you.* and sometimes, you just have to get real with yourself. 

when i see that lego set, i'm telling myself ""you lazy motherfucker, you're not going to spend your time building that."" 

and when i see that beautiful solar g shock that can be submerged for 17 years at 50000 meters, i think ""but when's the last time you actually went outside?"" 

think things over. find reviews. imagine yourself using it. then repeat the process. i sit on purchases for months sometimes before actually going through with the purchase. sometimes, by the time i'm ready to buy whatever it is, there's a nice discount on it. other times, they raise the price and i just repeat the process again. it happens. 

iii. eating out is your enemy. 

as i grow older, i find that most of that ""fun time"" money is going towards eating out. the money is fair game, so financially, it's fine. but mentally? imagine the toll. postmates and grubhub are cancer. it's convienent. too convienent. and the additional fees are outrageous. 

do yourself a favour. go to the grocery store more often. buy shit you'll actually want to eat. buy what you crave. live a little.  remember, it's fun money. not grocery money. 
$20 of food from the store would have satisfied me more than  $20 of delivery fees from postmates.

and that's it. budgeting can suck at first and can be hard depending on what your situation is. i just wanted to share some points and tips that might help the average guy out. 



edit: firstly, thank you for the gold, stranger. 

secondly, i wasn't expecting this to blow up, but i'm glad i was able to make some points that resonated with people! 

also wanted to note that i'm an amateur when it comes to saving and budgeting. this post wasn't intended to go into the realm of investing, 401k, etc. not to say you shouldn't! there's plenty of people that have recommended investing, and that have also given some tips on where to start. 

thanks, y'all. ",10
"crypto-currency: a guide to common tax situations. status: majority of questions have been answered. if yours got missed, please feel free to post it again.

**introduction**

all,

based on the rapid increase in popularity and price of bitcoin and other crypto currencies (particularly over the past year), i expect that lots of people have questions about how crypto currency will impact their taxes. this thread attempts to address several common issues. i'm posting similar versions of it here, in several major crypto subs, and eventually in the weekly ""tax help"" threads r/personalfinance runs.

i'd like to thank the /r/personalfinance mod team and the /r/tax community for their help with this thread and especially for reading earlier versions and offering several valuable suggestions/corrections.

**this thread is not an endorsement of crypto currency as an investing strategy**. there is a time and a place to debate the appropriateness of crypto as part of a diversified portfolio - but that time is not now and that place is not here. if you are interested in the general consensus of this sub on investing, i would urge you to consult the wiki(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index#wiki_investing) while keeping in mind the general flowchart(https://i.imgur.com/lsouqr2.png) outlining basic steps to get your finances in order.

finally, please note that this thread attempts to provide information about your tax obligations as defined by united states law (and interpreted by the irs under the direction of the treasury department). i understand that a certain portion of the crypto community tends to view crypto as ""tax free"" due to the (actual and perceived) difficulty for the irs to ""know"" about the transactions involved. i **will not** discuss unlawfully concealing crypto gains here nor will i suggest illegal tax avoidance activities.
___
**the basics**

this section is best for people that don't understand much about taxes. it covers some very basic tax principles. it also assumes that all you did during the year was buy/sell a single crypto currency.

fundamentally, the irs treats crypto not as money, but as an asset (investment). while there are a few specific ""twists"" when it comes to crypto, when in doubt replace the word ""crypto"" with the word ""stock"" and you will get a pretty good idea how you should report and pay tax on crypto.

the first thing you should know is that the majority of this discussion applies to the taxes you are currently working on (2017 taxes). the tax bill that just passed applies to 2018 taxes (with a few very tiny exceptions), which most people will file in early 2019.
 
in general, you don't have to report or pay taxes on crypto currency holdings until you ""cash out"" all or part of your holdings. for now, i'm going to assume that you cash out by selling them for usd; however, other forms of cashing out will be covered later.

when you sell crypto, you report the difference between your basis (purchase price) and proceeds (sale price) on schedule d. your purchase price is commonly referred to as your basis; while the two terms don't mean exactly the same thing, they are pretty close to one another (in particular, there are ~~three~~ two ways to calculate your basis - ~~your average cost~~, a first-in, first-out method, and a ""specific identification"" method. see more about these here(https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/cost_basis_methods#changing_methods) and here(https://investor.vanguard.com/taxes/cost-basis/methods)). **edit** - you may not use average cost method with crypto - see here(https://www.irs.gov/publications/p551#en_us_201612_publink1000256905). if you sell at a gain, this gain increases your tax liability; if you sell at a loss, this loss decreases your tax liability (in most cases). if you sell multiple times during the year, *you report each transaction separately* (bad news if you trade often) but get to lump all your gains/losses together when determining how the trades impact your income.

one important thing to remember is that there are two different types of gains/losses from investments - short term gains (if you held an asset for one year or less) and long term gains (over one year; i.e. one year and one day). short term gains are taxed at your marginal income rate (basically, just like if you had earned that money at a job) while long term gains are taxed at lower rates.

for most people, long term capital gains are taxed at 15%. however, if you are in the 10% or 15% tax bracket, congrats - your gains (up to the maximum amount of ""unused space"" in your bracket) are tax free! if you are in the 25%, 28%, 33%, or 35% bracket, long term gains are taxed at 15%. if you are in the 39.6% bracket, long term gains are taxed at 20%. additionally, there is an ""extra"" 3.8% tax that applies to gains for those above $200,000/$250,000 (single/married). the exact computation of this tax is a little complicated, but if you are close to the $200,000 level, just know that it exists.

finally, you should know that i'm assuming that you should treat your crypto gains/losses as investment gains/losses. i'm sure some people will try and argue that they are really ""day traders"" of crypto and trade as a full time job. while this is possible, the vast majority of people don't qualify for this status and you should really think several times before deciding you want to try that approach on the irs.
___
**""cashing out"" - trading crypto for goods/services**

i realize that not everyone that ""cashes out"" of crypto does so by selling it for usd. in fact, i understand that some in the crypto community view the necessity of cashing out itself as a type of myth(https://imgur.com/ge8hdny). in this section, i discuss what happens if you trade your crypto for basically anything that isn't cash (minor sidenote - see next section for a special discussion on trading crypto for crypto; i.e. buying altcoins with crypto).

the irs views trading crypto for something of value as a type of bartering that must be included in income. from the irs's perspective, it doesn't matter if you sold crypto for cash and bought a car with that cash or if you just traded crypto directly for the car - in both cases, the irs views you as having sold your crypto. this approach isn't unique to crypto - it works the same way if you trade stock for something.

this means that if you do trade your crypto for ""stuff"", you have to report every exchange as a sale of your crypto and calculate the gain/loss on that sale, just as if you had sold the crypto for cash.

finally, there is one important exception to this rule. if you give your crypto away to charity (one recognized by the irs; like a 501(c)(3) organization), the irs doesn't make you report/pay any capital gains on the transaction. additionally, you still get to deduct the value of your donation on the date it was made. now, from a ""selfish"" point of view, you will always end up with more money if you sell the crypto, pay the tax, and keep the rest. but, if you are going to make a donation anyway, especially a large one, giving crypto where you have a big unrealized/untaxed gain is a very efficient way of doing so.
___
**""alt coins"" - buying crypto with crypto**

the previous section discusses what happens when you trade crypto for stuff. however, one thing that surprises many people is that trading crypto for crypto is also a taxable event, just like trading crypto for a car. whether you agree with this position or not, it makes a lot of sense once you realize that the irs doesn't view crypto as money, but instead as an asset. so to the irs, trading bitcoin for ripple isn't like trading dollars for euros, but it is instead like trading shares of apple stock for shares of tesla stock.

practically, what this means is that if you trade one crypto for another crypto (say btc for xrp just to illustrate the point), the irs views you as doing the following:

* selling for cash the amount of btc you actually traded for xrp.
* owing capital gains/losses on the btc based on its selling price (the fair market value at the moment of the exchange) and your purchase price (basis).
* buying a new investment (xrp) with a cost basis equal to the amount the btc was worth when you exchanged them.

this means that if you ""time"" your trade wrong and the value of xrp goes down after you make the exchange, you still owe tax on your btc gain even though you subsequently lost money. the one good piece of news in this is that when/if you sell your xrp (or change it back to btc), you will get a capital loss for the value that xrp dropped.

there is one final point worth discussing in this section - the so called ""like kind exchange"" rules (aka section 1031 exchange). at a high level, these rules say that you can ""swap"" property with someone else without having to pay taxes on the exchange as long as you get property in return that is ""like kind"". typically, these rules are used in real estate transactions. however, they can also apply to other types of transactions as well.

while the idea is simple (and makes it sound like crypto for crypto should qualify), the exact rules/details of this exception are very fact specific. most experts (including myself, but certainly not calling myself an expert) believe that a crypto for crypto swap **is not** a like kind exchange. the recently passed tax bill also explicitly clarifies this issue - starting in 2018, only real estate qualifies for like kind exchange treatment. so, basically, the vast majority of evidence suggests that you can't use this ""loophole"" for 2017; however, there is a small minority view/some small amount of belief that this treatment would work for 2017 taxes and it is worth noting that i'm unaware of any court cases directly testing this approach.

**dealing with ""forks""**

perhaps another unpleasant surprise for crypto holders is that ""forks"" to create a new crypto also very likely generate a taxable event. the irs has long (since at least the 1960s) held that ""found"" money is a taxable event. this approach has been litigated in court and courts have consistently upheld this position; it even has its own cool nerdy tax name - the ""treasure trove"" doctrine.

practically, what this means is that if you owned btc and it ""forked"" to create bch, then the fair market value of the bch you received is considered a ""treasure trove"" that must be reported as income (ordinary income - no capital gain rates). this is true whether or not you sold your bch; if you got bch from a fork, that is a taxable event (note - i'll continue using btc forking to bch in this section as an example, but the logic applies to all forks).

while everything i've discussed up to this point is pretty clearly established tax law, forks are really where things get messy with taxes. thus, the remainder of this section contains more speculation than elsewhere in this post - the truth is that while the idea is simple (fork = free money = taxable), the details are messy and other kinds of tax treatment might apply to forks.

one basic practical problem with forks is that the new currency doesn't necessarily start trading immediately. thus, you may have received bch before there was a clear price or market for it. basically, you owe tax on the value of bch when you received it, but it isn't completely clear what that value was. there are several ways you can handle this; i'll list them in order from most accurate to least accurate (but note that this is just my personal view and there is ongoing disagreement on this issue with little/no authoritative guidance).

* use a futures market to determine the value of the bch - if reliable sources published realistic estimates of what bch will trade for in the future once trading begins, use this estimate as the value of your bch. pros/cons - futures markets are, in theory, pretty accurate. however, if they are volatile/subject to manipulation, they may provide an incorrect estimate of the true value of bch. it would suck to use the first futures value published only to have that value plummet shortly thereafter, leaving you to pay ordinary income tax but only have an unrealized capital loss.

* wait until an exchange starts trading bch; use the actual (""spot"" price) as the value. pros/cons - spot prices certainly reflect what you could have sold bch for; however, it is possible that the true value of the coin was higher/lower when you received it as compared to when it started trading on the exchange. thus this method seems less accurate to me than a futures based approach, but it is still certainly fairly reasonable.

* assume that the value is $0. this is my least preferred option, but there is still a case to be made for it. if you receive something that you didn't want, can't access, can't sell, and might fail, does it have any value? i believe the answer is yes (maybe not value it perfectly, but value it somewhat accurately), but if you honestly think the answer is no, then the correct tax answer would be to report $0 in income from the fork. the irs would be most likely to disagree with this approach, especially since it results in the least amount of income reported for the current year (and the most favorable rates going forward). accordingly, if you go this route, make extra sure you understand what it entails.

note, once you've decided what to report as taxable income, this amount also becomes your cost basis in the new crypto (bch). thus, when you ultimately sell your bch (or trade it for something else as described above), you calculate your gain/loss based on what you included in taxable income from the fork.

finally, there is one more approach to dealing with forks worth mentioning. a fork ""feels"" a lot like a dividend - because you held btc, you get bch. in a stock world, if i get a cash dividend because i own the stock, that money **is not** treated as a ""treasure trove"" and subject to ordinary income rates - in most cases, it is a qualified dividend and subject to capital gain rates; in some cases, some types of stock dividends are completely non taxable. this article(https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/08/04/how-to-report-bitcoin-cash-and-avoid-irs-trouble/2/#6af873a0a1d2) discusses this idea in slightly more detail and generally concludes that forks should not be treated as a dividend. still, i would note that i'm unaware of any court cases directly testing this theory.

ultimately, this post is supposed to be practical, so let me make sure to leave you with two key thoughts about the taxation of forks. first, i believe that the majority of evidence suggests that forks should be treated as a ""treasure trove"" and reported as ordinary income based on their value at creation and that this is certainly the ""safest"" option. second, out of everything discussed in this post, i also believe that the correct taxation of forks is the murkiest and most ""up for debate"" area. if you are interested in a more detailed discussion of forks, see this thread(https://np.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/7p1kw6/draft_discussion_of_crypto_currency_and_taxes_for/) for a previous version of this post discussing it at even more length and the comments for a discussion of this with the r/tax community.

**mining crypto**

successfully mining crypto coins is a taxable event. depending on the amount of effort you put into mining, it is either considered a hobby or a self-employment (business) activity. the irs provides the following list of questions to help decide the correct classification:

* the manner in which the taxpayer carries on the activity.
* the expertise of the taxpayer or his advisors. 
* the time and effort expended by the taxpayer in carrying on the activity. 
* expectation that assets used in activity may appreciate in value.
* the success of the taxpayer in carrying on other similar or dissimilar activities.
* the taxpayer's history of income or losses with respect to the activity.
* the amount of occasional profits, if any, which are earned.

if this still sounds complicated, that's because the distinction is subject to some amount of interpretation. as a rule of thumb, randomly mining crypto on an old computer is probably a hobby; mining full time on a custom rig is probably a business.

in either event, you must include in income the fair market value of any coins you successfully mine. these are ordinary income and your basis in these coins is their fair market value on the date they were mined. if your mining is a hobby, they go on line 21 (other income) and any expenses directly associated with mining go on schedule a (miscellaneous subject to 2% of agi limitation). if your mining is a business, income and expenses go on schedule c.

both approaches have pros and cons - hobby income isn't subject to the 15.3% self-employment tax, only normal income tax, but you get fewer deductions against your income and the deductions you get are less valuable. business income has more deductions available, but you have to pay payroll (self-employment) tax of about 15.3% in addition to normal income tax.

**what if i didn't keep good records? do i really have to report every transaction?**

one nice thing about the irs treating crypto as an asset is that we can look at how the irs treats people that ""day trade"" stock and often don't keep great records/have lots of transactions. while you need to be as accurate as possible, it is ok to estimate a little bit if you don't have exact records (especially concerning your cost basis). you need to put in some effort (research historical prices, etc...) and be reasonable, but the irs would much rather you do a little bit of reasonable estimation as opposed to just not reporting anything. sure, they might decide to audit you/disagree with some specifics, but you earn yourself a lot of credit if you can show that you honestly did the best you reasonably could and are making efforts to improve going forward.

however, concerning reporting every transaction - yes, sorry, it is clear that you have to do this, even if you made hundreds or thousands of them. stock traders have had to go through this for many decades, and there is absolutely no reason to believe that the irs would accept anything less from the crypto community. if you have the records or have any reasonable way of obtaining records/estimating them, you must report every transaction.

**what if i don't trust you?**

well, first let me say that i can't believe you made it all the way down here to this section. thanks for giving me an honest hearing. i would strongly encourage you to go read other well-written, honest guides. i'll link to some i like (both more technical irs type guides and more crypto community driven guides). while a certain portion of the crypto community seems to view one of the benefits of crypto as avoiding all government regulation (including taxes), i've been pleasantly surprised to find that many crypto forums contain well reasoned, accurate tax guides. while i may not agree with 100% of their conclusions, that likely reflects true uncertainty around tax law that is fundamentally complex rather than an attempt on either end to help individuals unlawfully avoid taxes.

"housing down payments 101. so you want to buy a house, eh?  here's some information that can help with that pesky down payment(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/down-payment-1.aspx): how much do you need, and where should you get it?  this is for us audiences. and assumes you are buying a personal residence.  note that this is intended as an overview, and doesn't cover every possible option or alternative available, especially locally to you or specific to your situation.  this writeup assumes  you are qualified for a loan in other ways, such as credit history.

**the basics.**  lenders want you to have your own money at risk in a house purchase, thus the down payment, which forms your initial equity.    20% of the price is a popular target; this gives the lender a cushion in the event they need to foreclose, since you will take the first 20% of the loss in foreclosure.  

most conventional(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/conventional-fha-va-mortgage.aspx) (i.e. non-government-backed) mortgages will require private mortgage insurance (pmi)(https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-private-mortgage-insurance-en-122/) if you don't put 20% down; usually you need at least 5%, though.  that's not the end of the world, but it's an added cost to you, so we'll look at that shortly.  note that there are some conventional mortgages with reduced / eliminated pmi, but they are limited to certain lenders or situations.  most people won't have those options.   since 2/3 of mortgages  are conventional, we'll spend more time discussing how down payments and pmi work for these type of loans.  

alternatively,  the government guarantees other mortgage products, including fha, va and usda loans, that have reduced down payment requirements(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/4-mortgages-that-require-little-money-down-1.aspx); the government assumes some of the risk, allowing a reduced down payment, and gets you to pay the rest of it in various ways.   you have to be a veteran for a  va loan, and only certain ruralish locations are eligible for usda loans(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/mortgages/usda-loan/) (and the best deals are for people with low income), but if those work for you, those are good options with 0% (!) down payment.   fha loans(https://www.fha.com/fha_article?id=210) are more of a mixed blessing because you end up paying  their version of pmi, called mip(https://themortgagereports.com/7570/fha-mip-cancel); down payments on fha mortgages start at 3.5%.  

**how much should you put down?**  that's easy, right? 20%?  well, maybe not.    the average down payment(http://realtormag.realtor.org/daily-news/2017/02/15/big-down-payment-myth ) in 2016 was 11% across all types of mortgages, so plenty of conventional mortgages are written with less than 20% down.  you just pay extra through pmi for the privilege of the bank taking on more risk.  

you have three main ways of paying pmi(http://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/options-paying-private-mortgage-insurance/): 

- as an added fee to your monthly payment, usually about .5% to 1% of the house price / year, paid monthly, but it varies based on down payment and credit score;

- as a higher interest rate (perhaps .25% more) for the life of your loan, so-called lender-paid pmi (but you really pay it anyway);

- as a one-time lump sum(https://smartasset.com/mortgage/what-is-single-payment-mortgage-insurance).  you pay something like 3% of the house price up front in lieu of monthly surcharges.  unlike a down payment, this doesn't go towards your equity.

so, you have options.  the monthly surcharge pmi can be eliminated(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/removing-private-mortgage-insurance.aspx) once you pay down the principal of your loan to below 80% of your original purchase price.  that could take a while if you make minimum payments with a small down payment, but if your income grows, you could be in a position to eliminate pmi within a few years.  while paying down a mortgage isn't always the best use of money, paying enough to eliminate pmi is typically more rewarding and worth the effort.  

(some mortgages also allow you to eliminate pmi if your house appreciates enough to make your equity 20%+, but that's not universal and will require you to do some work and pay some fees.)

the exact amount you put down depends on your specific situation; try for 20% if you can do it, since it will give you better financing options.   you will also pay less monthly with a larger down payment.  you probably won't get a better interest rate with a bigger down payment > 20%, so that's not something to plan for.  

**where should you get the money?**  the down payment should be your money, so, ideally, you want to save up for this over time.   a typical nationwide house price might be $250,000, so 20% down would be $50,000; if you saved $1000/month, you could do that in about four years.   (and, yes, in many places houses cost much, much more.  adjust accordingly.)   but, that's a lot of savings, and that's a long time.  so, what else can you do?

**gifts** from relatives are a very popular option, actually.  lenders are used to these and like them.  there is typically no gift tax if your parents  give you $20,000 or even $50,000 as a down payment.  problem solved, for those lucky enough to have this as an option.  note that loans from relatives are not the same and not nearly as cool.  you will usually need to document that money from relatives is a gift and not a stealth loan.  if your relatives sell you their house for less than market value, this is also treated a down payment gift, a so-called gift of equity(https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/for-wiki-how-to-give-equity-as-a-gift.aspx).

**special programs** exist in certain places to give homebuyers, especially first-time buyers for some definition of first-time, some assistance with their down payment.  (sometimes ""first-time"" just means ""didn't own a house recently."") you might not know about the good neighbor next door(https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/hud?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/reo/goodn/gnndabot) program that helps municipal employees in certain cities get a big discount on their homes.   that's an example of program you probably don't qualify for, but there could be something local to you that you do qualify for, e.g. in ohio(http://myohiohome.org/firsttimehomebuyer.aspx) or austin, tx(http://www.austintexas.gov/department/down-payment-assistance) or various other places.  look around at what's available in your state, and in cities near you.  sometimes these are low-cost loans; other times they are grants, especially for low-income households.   not everybody has these, though.  many people don't have any good options here.  

**retirement accounts**  this is an option, but not an ideal one.  most people retire one day, so that's a higher priority than buying a house.  if you are convinced you want to do this, your best options are either a 401k loan(https://themortgagereports.com/18789/should-you-borrow-from-your-401k-to-purchase-a-home-gina-pogol),  or a distribution from an ira.   roth contributions are the best way to do this not-so-good idea.  you can also tap ira gains up to $10,000 without penalty once in a lifetime, but you may owe taxes on the money.

**another loan**  you can borrow part of your downpayment with a so-called piggyback loan(https://mymortgageinsider.com/80-10-10-piggyback-mortgage/).  you still come up with part of the money yourself, but then borrow enough additional in a second mortgage to eliminate pmi.  you then have two loans to pay back.  it's an option, but not usually your best option.

**where to save for your down payment?**  many people coming to this forum want to ""put their money to work"", and especially for a house down payment.  but, sadly, your money is not very ambitious, and won't work very hard for you in typical down-payment-size amounts and timetables.   if you are saving for a house purchase within five years, you don't want to put your money at risk of a 20% stock market correction that will inevitably occur just before you need the money.   your contributions will dominate any interest or earnings over a short timetable, so just use something that pays interest without principal risk.  (unless you really do want to risk your down payment.  most people don't.)

so there is some basic information about down payments.   if you have specific questions, let me know and i will try to answer them and update this.  see also closing costs here: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6tu91h/buyers_closing_costs_101/",10
"uber driving is an awful use of your time, and i crunched the numbers to prove it.. before reading, understand that this is an exercise in averages. many people in the comments have shown how uber driving can work, especially those that mention driving optimal cars and making use of tax deduction. my post explores only the averages of car, distance, and earnings, and is not meant to say that an uber driver is automatically stuck with a sub-minimum wage job - just that they will be if they don't manage themselves properly.

---

tl;dr: at $0.56 a mile to own and operate a vehicle, an uber driver making average hourly wage driving on average the same distance as a taxi driver will be left with $5.60 an hour after driving-related expenses. a driver making $8.40, driving the same distance, would have to put all of that money back into their vehicle to continue driving.

-----

everywhere i look, i see more and more people making uber driving a part of their life, whether they do it on the side or made it their full time job to drive 56 hours every week. from the outset, i imagined the whole thing was not much but a money sink, and with the post on the front page classifying uber drivers as workers in the u.k. (and the discussion within), i looked up the statistics and found that driving for uber doesn't even come close to netting minimum wage in the long term.

my reasoning for this is that, although uber pays on average greater than minimum wage, the cost of maintaining a car while using it as a courier vehicle chips severely into the money you would actually make. before i get any further, here's some relevant numbers and links to back them up.

* average hourly pay: $14/hr(https://www.glassdoor.com/hourly-pay/uber-driver-hourly-pay-e575263_d_ko5,1)
* high end hourly pay: $30$/hr(https://www.glassdoor.com/hourly-pay/uber-driver-hourly-pay-e575263_d_ko5,1)
* cost of owning/operating a car: ~$9000/yr, driving 15,000 miles(http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/16/aaa-car-ownership-costs/2070397/)
* distance a taxi driver drives: 180m/12hrs, or 15m/hr(http://www.ehow.com/info_8446407_many-cab-driver-drive-yearly.html)

because there are so many variables, i'm making the following assumptions. the car being driven is being used only for uber driving (which, when considering how this would play out over years, would even out with how often the car needed replaced). other websites, including uber itself, has attempted to calculate expenses based on toll costs and gasoline usage, but i am going to use the aaa numbers, that also factor in the price of actually buying a car and routine maintenance. all of this is expected if you're using your car long term more than you normally would. lastly, i'm going to assume for now that our uber driver is making the expected $14/hr, though i'll experiment with how these numbers affect other wage levels.

now let's assume our driver is driving the expected 15 miles every hour, 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. in this full time position, they are driving 2496 hours and making $34,944. 

now, we factor in expenses. the aaa numbers put yearly expenses at $9000 for 15,000 miles, but our uber driver is going 37,440 miles (2496hrs*15m/hr). after some math ($9,000x37,440/15,000), expenses come out to $22,464.

yes. that cushy middle of the road salary, after just the expenses of paying for your car's expected maintenance, comes out to $12,480. a full 60% of that $14 wage is taken by your car, leaving you with $5.60 every hour you work. $8.40 is expected to go into car maintenance every hour, or every 15 miles - and there are drivers that might not even make that much. also, if you don't live in the uk, you don't even get employee benefits, so i'd keep that in mind.

the picture is bleak for some, but better for others. in high-paying metro areas like new york, one can net $30 an hour, leaving them with a cushy $21.60 an hour after putting money aside to maintain their livelihood. numbers like these are at least reasonable, but harder to come by and seem to have a casual, positive relationship with the cost of living in the area.

my plea after this wall of math and text - don't expect to keep that giant wad of extra cash from casually driving on the weekends. these costs per mile, no matter how small, stack up and take their toll on the black ink in your balance book. if you think you can make a career out of uber, great - but know that they aren't looking after you when it comes to these long term costs. people can and do make a hefty sum of money driving for uber, but ignoring the toll it takes down the road is dangerous. drive smart and please at least make money.

----

*i tried to base as much reasoning as possible off of distance driven, not hours, since the distance is ultimately what affects how long you can drive your car before you need new oil, new tires, or a new vehicle outright. still, my method wasn't perfect, because i couldn't find how much an uber driver makes on average per trip, along with average trip distance. i trust the aaa numbers, and glassdoor's salary numbers to a lesser degree, but there is great variety both in wages and how much a car costs per year or mile to operate. maximizing wage (working in peak times/peak places) and minimizing expense (getting better fuel economy, purchasing cars that cost less or last longer) will net you much less bleak numbers than i project above.

---

edit: since the aaa numbers were brought into question, i took a closer look. the costs for tires, gas, maintenance, and depreciation are all tied to mileage. however the costs for insurance (a cool ~$2400) is not tied to mileage and can very well be factored into personal expenses, so it might not matter as much. a significant decrease, to be sure, but the costs of driving still cannot be ignored.

as an additional edit, many have been saying that uber covers your insurance, which would chunk off another $1000 of calculated expenses. according to this link(https://newsroom.uber.com/insurance-for-uberx-with-ridesharing/), i come to the understanding that uber provides their insurance to you while you are available, but does not cover you when you are off duty (eg. driving home or off the clock), meaning you would still need personal insurance. if someone can explain to me better how you can disregard insurance costs, i would greatly appreciate it.

edit: i'd like to emphasize that if you do it right, you can make pretty solid profits. here(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/59vutb/uber_driving_is_an_awful_use_of_your_time_and_i/d9chnau/) is an example from a user in the comments below, who manages to be above the curve in pay and below the curve in expenses. itemize your expenses like he does, be aware that uber driving adds expenses to your usual driving, and enjoy the perks that uber does have.

"gf is selling her dress for $100, gets a check for $1,980, scam?. my girlfriend is selling an old prom dress for $100, she got a call from what seemed like a nice older woman, who wanted to buy it, but she needed her to hold it for her until this weekend, in exchange she said she would pay an extra $70. the woman said she would have some relatives coming into town to pick up the dress. so far so good.

then today my gf got a check from the woman for $1,980, much more than the agreed $170. the dress itself was bought new for $400. i wondered if the woman mistakenly added another zero. so we called the woman and sent her a picture of the check asking if the check was correct. the woman said that it was correct and she wanted to give her a little extra for her trouble. we haven't even given her the dress yet.

i think the woman still could have made a mistake and still hasn't noticed. or maybe the check will bounce, but then why did she send the check before she got the dress?

my gf thinks that woman's ""relatives"" could come to kidnap her. 

my mom thinks we should cash the check at a check city so that we can get it in cash without any bank information being involved. 

is this some sort of scam?

edit: we called her back and she said $1,800 is for the movers, aka family members that are picking up the dress.",10

- you can apply for a credit card(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/creditcards) once you have income.  this is different than the debit card your bank will provide with your account. this has pros and cons, but is a reasonable move for many people.  it's the best way to independently establish credit without paying interest. a secured(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/nerdwallets-best-secured-credit-cards/) or student(http://www.creditcards.com/college-students.php) card is probably your best option.  pay the balance in full every month!  if you can't do that, then you are not ready to use a credit card.

- if you need money to continue your education, learn about student loans(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans).  this is a complicated topic with many options.  be careful what you do here, since these loans will be yours(http://blog.credit.com/2015/06/what-happens-if-i-ignore-my-student-loans-84434/) / your parents until they are paid off!  people who find themselves in trouble(http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/08/heaviest-college-debt-burdens-fall-on-3-types-of-students) later usually took  out bigger loans (~$100,000) vs. smaller loans (~$20,000).

- for cost-effective education, it's hard to beat community colleges(http://www.marketwatch.com/story/four-reasons-to-choose-community-college-2013-11-15).  if you're not sure what to do about continuing your education, look into two-year degrees(http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/associate), as well as taking credits that transfer to four-year colleges(http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/professors-guide/2009/09/16/10-tips-for-transferring-from-community-college).  

- you may find yourself working part-time or even full-time.  this is a good time to learn about your rights and responsibilities(http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/employee-rights)  as an employee, including how you are paid(http://money.howstuffworks.com/wage2.htm) and taxed(https://www.irs.com/articles/understanding-payroll-and-withholding-taxes), as well as what your employer can legally do with your hours and even when you can be let go.  fortunately, taxes are low for most young people (if only because their income is low...), and you may even get a refund if you file taxes!  while your lifetime income is the single biggest determinant in your personal finance situation, at this age, your priority is not on current income as much as preparing for the future, thus the focus on education.  

-  this is also the time to start learning about budgeting(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting) if you have significant responsibilities; more on this in future posts. 

- if you want to save money, live with your parents as long as you can.  seriously!   but there comes a time when you want to / have to leave, and you'll need to rent a place.  landlords will want to see that you have income(http://www.myfirstapartment.com/2015/06/how-much-rent-can-i-afford-on-my-income-two-simple-ways-to-estimate/), so try to keep payments below 30% of your takehome pay(http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/how-much-rent-you-can-really-afford-renters-solutions-186462).  you may need a co-signer if you have minimal credit history.   you'll need first month's rent and a security deposit up front, and even utility deposits sometimes.  read your lease before you sign it, and know your rights and responsibilities(https://www.ziprealty.com/buy/renters-rights.jsp) as a tenant, and what organizations can help you if you encounter issues.  

- roommates are a popular way to save money on rent.  be aware of the issues that can come up with roommates though, since circumstances change, and you may be on the hook for their share.  have all roommates on the lease.  you might even want a roommate agreement(http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/renters-rights-book/chapter6-2.html).  perhaps sheldon cooper has it right after all?  alternatively, consider renting a room from someone who owns their own house.

- aside from rent, cars are the biggest expenditure for many young people.  you can save a lot of money(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/total-cost-owning-car/) if you don't need to pay for one!   it's not just the purchase cost.  there's gas, repairs, and especially car insurance(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance), which is  very expensive(http://www.carinsurance.com/articles/cheapest-minimum-liability-insurance.aspx) for young people, typically at least $100/month, and can even be $200/month in some places, or if you have a tickets / accidents. 

-  your best bet if you do need a car is to save up $5000 or so for a reliable used car(http://www.carsdirect.com/used-car-buying/best-5-reliable-used-car-models), then pay cash, so you can avoid finance charges and make your own insurance choices.  if you do need to finance a car, be very careful of financing offers for young people.  double-digit interest rates are a bad thing.  you do not want to ""build credit"" that way! the loan and the car are different things.  you can't give back the car and be done with the loan, since you will typically be ""underwater(http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/being-upside-down.html)"" and owe more than the car is worth.  

- choose your spending wisely.  money spent is unavailable for anything else. make sure it was your highest priority use of that money.

that's all for now.  stay tuned for the next installment, eli22(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tlqsd/eli22_personal_finance_tips_for_older_young/), about more on these topics, as well as retirement accounts, repaying student loans, health insurance, and other such fun things.

"6-24 months until totally disabled, 5-10 years to live. financial planning advice.. i am in my mid-40s and have been diagnosed with an incurable disease. i am already symptomatic and its getting worse week by week. i don't know how much longer i will be able to keep working.  my wife died of breast cancer 7 years ago. my daughter (12) and i live a little over an hour from family. saw the doctor yesterday and they confirmed the bad news they warned me about a couple weeks ago - the disease continues to progress, there is no cure, the treatment to slow it down was only partially successful. i should become unable to care for myself disabled in 6-24 months and just over 50% survival rate at about 5 years out, around 20% at 10 years out.

i told my parents and siblings today. they are freaked out and upset, but are being very helpful. here is my plan - please tell me if i am missing anything.

good news - i have great benefits at work. i have 5 times my annual salary life insurance, great health insurance, and a two-thirds salary disability policy that i took after taxes ... so that if i ever collected it, it will be tax free. i have about $100,000 saved for retirement through work 401k. i have about 130 hours of paid time off accrued at work.

i am taking the next week off work to get my affairs in order. i received a trusted recommendation for an attorney to update my will, my powers of attorney, and my living will ... and the family member made a phone call - i have an appointment on monday afternoon. i plan to discuss a trust for my daughter that my parents will administer until she turned 25.

we bought a house 4 years ago to be close to work. i'm a veteran so we used 0% down va home loan. i am going to look into selling the house ... should about break even after fees ... might get a few thousand out of it. plan to find a place to rent close to my parents. they live in a good school district so i will stay in their school district so that on my next hospital stay (already had two in the last 6 months ... one for a week and one for 4 days) she can stay with my parents and still take the bus the school and from school. my mom had to take off work to stay with her the last two times. we will plan to move as soon as school lets out for the summer.

my mom is now looking at single story rancher homes and handicap accessible apartments in the same school district as them. so far, rancher style homes are hard to come by but we have a few leads on apartments. i am going to go look at some on tuesday. do you use a real estate agent to find a rental? how do they get paid?

i will need to find a house cleaning service. my fatigue is already too bad to clean the house and i wouldn't be able to do laundry without my daughter's help. is there a better kind of helper to consider? someone who can come two or three times a week to do all the housework? i can't even put the dishes away anymore and i feel horrible that my 12 year old is now taking care of almost all this type of work in the home. things like changing the batteries in the smoke alarms or changing the air filters didn't get done at all the last time change. i told my dad this and he came today to do it. that really made it hit home for me.

i am looking for a family counselor close to my parents for my daughter and i to see. i told her i am sick and am looking into us moving closer to her grandparents. she is excited about moving. i haven't told her the time frames involved with my illness ... but she lives day in and day out how ill i am every day. she sees i am getting worse. i don't want to probe too deep without a professional there to help guide us.

&#x200b;

i can still drive ... for now. not sure what to do long-term with the car. don't think this is a ""need to solve now"" problem. i have used disabled american veterans (dav) to get to a va appointment - i applied for disability compensation that i am still waiting to hear back on. is there a general ""drive you to doctor appointments"" type service - for veterans or otherwise? uber for sickies? or maybe just lyft drivers who would help you in the car for a tip?

i am also planning on looking for a disability attorney to guide me through how to approach this with work. i can still work right now (i have a desk job and can work remote three days a week) but i am not sure for how much longer. we got screwed over with my wife's disability when she got sick - she cut back her hours and that ended up disqualifying her for her work disability insurance even though she paid for it. she passed just a few months later and we had her life insurance so i didn't make anything about it. i had a kindergartner on my hands at the time and just didn't have the energy to fight it. the life insurance went to get us out of debt and let me take 3 months off to be with my daughter ... and get my head back on straight. i still have about $7,000 in savings left over from the life insurance that has always been our rainy day fund.

i want to try to travel with my daughter while i still can ... but that window is closing. my parents want to go with both of us for a family vacation to orlando this summer while i am hopefully still healthy enough to go ... even if i can't ride the ""good rides"".

what am i not thinking about? what else do i need to plan for?

\edit\ yes - it is a degenerative neurological condition.  we live in the mid-atlantic region of the us. sorry about the vagueness - don't want to be identifiable until i tell my employer.

\edit2\ - this blew up. thank you to everyone for your well wishes. thanks for the silver and gold ... but this is a throwaway. to those trying to guess the actual diagnosis, it is not als. it is something similar but something sometimes treatable. my presentation is not typical thus making this very rare and only partially treatable. once i tell work in a week, i can share the specifics but if i post the diagnosis, there are people at work who, if they saw this, would google it and easily guess it is me. i don't want work to know until i have the disability situation squared away.

i agree that making the most of this year with my daughter - trips, fun stuff - is a top priority.  photos and video a priority.  i also really like the letters to her future self idea and feel dumb i didn't think of that. thank you.

some seem to be proposing just dropping everything and focus on time with my daughter. while my heart agrees, my head still has to plan for me to be alive and disabled until 2030 and possibly beyond. if i can only work a few more months then i need to get my financial house in order to see her through high school and college while also providing for myself in a hospice type situation. so yes - fun trips but tempered with prudent planning and spending.  


\edit3\ found an apartment today. will fill out an application tomorrow. checked credit score today - 692 so should be good. and yes ... someone guessed the diagnosis. was it the anti-malaria drugs for the peripheral neuropathy that gave it away? i didn't even mention the ivig and saw someone post that he is probably getting it. reddit will never cease to amaze me.  thank you again to all the warm wishes.  i also spent 30 minutes sitting on my parent's deck talking to my dad today. i told him what i want for my funeral. he teared up but said he would make damn sure i got the best wake ever. ironic that this is bringing me closer to my dad. lots to read and watch with all the suggestions. thank you so much.",10

"the real reason dave ramsey is against index funds.. i always knew that the reason dave ramsey gave horrible investment advice to his listeners by advocating loaded mutual funds over low cost index funds was because he made money off the referral fees. however the actual amount he makes is staggering...

http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20170407/free/170409952/advisers-profit-through-association-with-dave-ramsey-x2014-but-not

advisers are paying about the same amount under the new program as they were under the old one. fees range from $400 per month to close to $900 per month, based on the size and population of the territory, as well as the number of referrals that come in over a period of time.

back of the envelope math shows that the former referral program and the current advertising program have been cash cows for mr. ramsey. if each of the 1,000 advisers in the program paid on the low end, $400 per month, that would translate into $400,000 of monthly revenue. if those same advisers paid on the high end, about $900, mr. ramsey's business could see revenues of as much as $900,000 per month from adviser advertising.

...so basically he makes around 5-10 million a year in his pocket by giving this horrible advice and if you listen to his show he has really double and trippled down hard on his position as noble prize winning research, popular culture, and his own listeners are becoming educated and have factually proven that index funds outperform loaded mufual funds over 80% of the time.

in a show this week he says, ""i dont perform surgery on myself i go to a professional. so why would i do it myself with investments, thats just stupid""

no dave...paying a commision stock broker 5.75% off the top to get a high fee underperforming activly managed fund instead of an index fund is the real stupidity.

"i saved $300 again this year because i made a 15 minute phone call.. last year, my husband decided to go back to school, thus losing about half our income. i called our internet company because i knew we were at a lowered rated and was hoping to keep it. the normal rate is $75 a month, we were paying $30 but it was set to expire that month. when we called we said we were thinking of moving to a different company and wanted to know if they could match or give us a lower rate. they agreed to keep our discount for another 12 months. that was last year and since my husband is still in school, we really were hoping to keep it. we made the call again and they agreed to keep it at $30 a month for another 12 months.

"30 year old resident doctor with $310,000 in student debt just accepted my first real job with $230,000 salary. i am in my last year of training as an emergency medicine resident living in a big midwest city. i have about $80,000 of student debt from undergrad and $230,000 of student debt from medical school (interest rates ranging from 3.4% to 6.8%). i went to med school straight after undergrad and started residency right after med school. 

resident salary for the past 3.5 years was about $50,000 (working close to 75 hours per week) so i was only able to make close to minimum payments. since interest has been accruing while i was in medical school and residency, i have not even begun to dig into the principal debt. thankfully, i just accepted an offer as an emergency physician with a starting salary of $230,000. 

i'm having trouble coming up with a plan to start paying back my debt as i also want to get married soon (fiance is a public school teacher) and i will need to help my parents financially (immigrant parents struggling to stay afloat). 

honestly, i'm scared to live frugally for the next 5 or so years because i feel like i've missed out so much during my life already (30 years old, haven't traveled anywhere, been driving a clunker, never owned anything, never been able to really help my parents who risked their lives to come to this country so i can have a better life). and after being around sick people (young and old) during the past 8 years my biggest fear in life is dying or getting sick before being able to enjoy the world. i am scared to wait until i'm in my mid 30s to start having fun and enjoying my life. 

what should i plan to do in the next couple year? pay most of the debt and save on interest or make standard payments and start doing the things that i really want to do? somewhere in the middle? any advice would be appreciated. ",10

"car totaled, and i used the money to pay off $13,500 in debt.. i've had credit card debt for way too long. two cards, one at about $3,300 and another around $4,600. and i took out a $10k loan for a 4runner a few years back that i probably shouldn't have. long story short, the car was pummled by hail in the spring, and totaled out. the insurance company called it a complete loss and cut me a check for $13,500 (which i thought was overvalued, but aparently they're worth way more in colorado than in illinois). 

i used the money to pay off the rest that i owed on the car ($5,600), and my two credit cards. i've been riding my bicycle since they took the car away, and am feeling physically and mentally great. the check just cleared and i wiped out all three debts within five minutes. i feel so liberated. now i just have to put all that money towards my student loans, and anticipate being debt free within three years.

i do want to say that subscribing to this forum kept my mind in the game regarding a debt free life. i've been chipping away at these debts, but this windfall was amazing and i feel like i just took the cheat tunnel in mario to skip a few levels. not having a car will be tough for a while, but luckily i can share with my wife when i need it, and ride my bike the rest of the time (13 miles round trip to/from work).

thanks pf!

edit: lots of good points. one of the best was that i could have sold the car before the hail damage and walked away with the same deal. that's true, and i think the real lesson here is that paying off old debts is more important than owning a nice car *if you don't need said car.*",10
"2 years 9 months and $68,000 later, i'm proud to announce that my wife and i are debt free!!. it's crazy that it's taken so long, but yet it's finally arrived. it was mostly school debt, some credit card debt, and one old dell computer (that my wife still uses), it's very freeing to finally not be a slave to the lender.

pay went from $26,000 three years ago to $86,000 last year. 

notable things we've done along the way:  
-move 6 times  
-have a baby  
-get married  
-(i) work two jobs the first year (80+ hours a week)  
-wife stay at home with baby  
-started and sold a business on reddit: coffeecrate.co  
-buy a 4runner with cash (wife wrecked our other 4runner on my birthday 2 years ago)  
-pay for $760 monthly insurance premium after obamacare  
-maintained a 10% giving budget  
-say 'no' a lot.  

we could have been out of debt sooner, but it was very difficult to stay focused the whole time. a shout out to dave ramsey's 7 step plan. only once in 3 years did we have to use part of the $1,000 emergency fund.

obligatory screen shots: http://imgur.com/a/gd0hh

the top image is total debt. my wife had paid down around 13k in debt before we got married that isn't included here. the first jump was college debt and the second big bump was getting married and adding my wife's debt to my mint account. 

the second picture is my net worth over time, that finally went positive two months ago. it's only going to keep going up from here.

http://imgur.com/xgwzn7u this is the last student loan that i paid off. $35,632. the biggest honker that was the last of the snowball. that one took me about 1.3 years to pay off, as you can see. 

i find it so much easier to pay off debt when you can visualize the debt going down like this. all my friends that came over asked about it and it reminded me what the focus was, and allowed us to talk about debt payments and why we're hanging out at our house, instead of going out and spending money. 

one tip i have for paying off debt is make the debt payment first and spend the rest of the money after the debt payment. i found that if i made the debt payment at the end of the month, i always had less money to pay towards debt, because we spent the money. if i paid a big chunk in the beginning of the month, the money wasn't there to spend. 

i hope this inspires you to let you know that it can be done. 

so i just want to yell, we're debt free!!!

"things you should know. consolidated best-practice tips that should be part of your common knowledge:

- a higher tax bracket due to a raise doesn't offset the whole  raise, since the higher rate applies only to the amount in the new bracket.   (you might lose some income-limited deductions, though.)

- likewise, all  employment income goes in one bucket to determine  tax liability.  your overtime / bonus is taxed the same as regular income, even if it is withheld at higher rates.  you square that up when you file.

- keeping a significant savings account while paying 20%+ interest on an outstanding credit card balance means you are losing something like 18% annually on money that could pay down debt.

- if you take out (or keep making payments on) an interest-bearing loan to help your credit history, then you are spending money to get a better credit rating.  that's backwards.  you want to improve credit at no cost to  save money on loans.   

- you want to always pay off the statement balance on your (interest-bearing) credit card each month without fail.  that will keep you from paying interest.   you don't have to pay the full balance, since that includes any new charges.  just the statement balance.  

- there is no appreciable downside to an online high yield savings account with a 2.0+% interest rate, vs. keeping the money with your local bank at .01% or some such thing.  

- credit unions are a great source of day-to-day banking services if you want better service and competitive rates.  some credit unions have easy-to-meet membership requirements.

- you won't get a risk-free, high  (>~3%) rate of return on your investments in any standard financial services product.   you can compensate for higher risk of stock market investments by leaving  the money for a period of five to ten years, to allow time for growth to overcome  price fluctuations.

- there are generally no federal gift taxes due to either the recipient or to the donor (giver), even on largeish gifts of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.   if you give someone over $15,000 in one year, you file a form  that reduces your lifetime exclusion, but you still don't pay gift taxes.  

that's all i can write up at the moment.  what else comes to mind that everybody should know?

"not quite finance but will cost you money if you fall for it - beware verizon wireless scam. i was just called on my verizon wireless cell phone, the caller id showed up as ""voicemail"" - i thought, that's odd. i usually don't answer calls if i don't know the person, but i answered this one. immediately a robot starts talking saying it is verizon and fraud has been detected on my account, press 1 to deactivate your account or press 2 to speak to a customer service rep. so i press 2 and a woman is on the other line saying she works at verizon wirelss and fraudulent activity may have been found on my account. she asks me if i ordered an iphone xs to north caroline. i live in new jersey so i said no i did not. she asks me if i know a certain persons name and address, again i say i don't know that person or address. she says ok there has been fraud on your account, we're going to lock it down and take care of that for you, for your security we are going to send you a number through text, when you get that please read it back to me. the text comes and it says something to the effect of:

""below is your temporary password. please remember verizon will never contact you to ask for this number.

23482349 (bunch of random numbers)""

thankfully i read the full text. i said to the woman ""it says here verizon will never contact me to ask for this number."" she doesn't miss a beat and responds with ""yes we will only ask for that number when we call you before hand and tell you what we are doing, that is to prevent any scammers from getting their hands on it."" so i responded ""like you?"" she continued to go on saying how she works at verizon and needs the number to prevent this fraud right away. i then hung up on her and called verizon with the number from their website just to be sure there was no fraud, and of course there wasn't.

what these people did is they went to verizonwireless.com and entered my phone number into the username/password login form. you can login with your number on vzw. so they put in my number and click forgot password, which resets your password and texts you a new one. if i had given that number that was texted to me to this woman she would have then been able to reset my account password to whatever she wanted and i wouldn't have been able to get back into my account. she could have ordered herself whatever she wanted from within my account. so please beware, if someone calls you from a company and says there is fraud hang up on them immediately and call the company from a number on their website. it will cost you only about 30 seconds and save you a ton of trouble!",10
"is a military career a good option if you have nothing to lose?. hey everyone, i wasn't quite sure what sub to ask this on but this one seemed the most appropriate. the title kind of says it all. i'm 20 years old, relatively fit and getting better everyday, no real close friends, pretty disconnected from family, and no so (not that i'm here for the pity party). i'm going to a community college currently and i'm almost finished with an aa in psychology. took me a couple years but i don't think college is really for me. i'm currently working a minimum wage job with no chance of a promotion (my boss said that herself) and it gets me just enough to put gas in my car and occasionally get a decent meal. i remember in high school we'd always have military people over basically saying you can find your purpose in the military. would a military career work out in both short term and long term? just looking for any advice at this point. 

i'm on mobile so sorry for any mistakes. 

edit: well this got bigger than expected haha. i just got off work and i want to thank everyone who took some time to help me out. i got a ton of messages, i'll try my best to respond to each one. thanks everyone, for the advice and words of wisdom. i have a lot to think about to say the least.

edit 2: just finished reading the last of the messages i got, i really appreciate everyone that took some time to message me and offer advice. thank you to everyone who shared their story and experiences with me, and thank you for your service. i still need to look into what job specifically i want to do, most people said to look for one that would be useful in the civilian sector. i definitely plan on continuing my education, especially if the benefits help cover it. i'll spend my day doing some research, responding to some messages, and looking for recruiters. thanks everyone.

"the cost of a speeding ticket is actually much higher than the fine itself. my gf had one speeding ticket last year. it made her insurance rate go up by $29/month for 3 years. this means that a single speeding ticket cost $1,044 more than the fine itself.

i never intentionally speed, but i had no idea that the cost of a single ticket could be so high. if more people were aware of this, there would be much less speeding and people could avoid these needless extra costs.",10
"don't forget, scammers call kids too. inform them to never give out personal information and if they feel threatened over the phone, to hang up and talk with you.. my 15 year old daughter texted me about a call that she got that creeped her out. it was a message alleging fraud, and she didn't know what was going on. it wasn't the first message they had left. i told her to call them back and they knew who she was, and said they were the irs and that she was looking at some big trouble. she said ""stop calling"" and hung up. 

when i got home, i called them and they answered the line as ""irs, how may i help you"" or some such bullshit. as soon as i mentioned them calling a child, they hung up. a few times. 

please educate your kids and hell, even you parents. the irs will not call you. ",10
"how blunt should i be with tech recruiters?. right now i make a good salary for my position. i've been at my current company for 5.5 years, so although i'm comfortable here and i'm paid well, i wouldn't mind leaving for an even better offer.

is it rude to basically say to these recruiters reaching out, if you can offer me more than x then i'd be interested. or do we have to keep pretending that money isn't one of the biggest factors in life these decisions?",10
"army claims they overpaid me 4 years later, says i owe $1000. i received a letter that i had been overpaid by dfas and i now owe $1000 and change after interest and late fees.

i have no idea what payment they are referring to. my credit report shows a debt in collections with the original account value being $872. this entry has tanked my credit score by 100 points. 

i went through all my bank statements and the only deposit close to that amount was during my last month in active duty during which i received two deposits close to that amount. one of them was my travel pay during my ets.

i have not been able to call to get more information yet but i dont even know what information to get or how to go about disputing this.

my biggest concern is my credit score as it is now dropped for 760+ to 660 ish. of course, paying $1000 unexpectedly will put me in a really bad spot financially as well.

what are my options here and how do i even move forward?

edit: wanted to say i'm overwhelmed by the general helpfulness of the responses. i am reading every single one of them. some more, possibly relevant information:

* i have had the same bank since 2011
* i have verified with my bank the last deposit from dfas was in march of 2014.
* the account that is showing on my credit report was opened in september 2017 and closed 1 month later
* it says it was sent to collections, but the letter demanding repayment that i received was from the dept of us treasury (bfs)
* i am nearly 100% certain this is not a scam
* i never received any notice of this debt prior to the letter that was post marked jan 31st, 2018

additional info for frequently asked:

it still shows dfas as the creditor on creditkarma. the letter came from the dept of treasury. the letter says i owe a little over $1000 but the accounts on my credit report show that it was ""placed for collections"" with a total of $872.

the letter states that if i dont pay it, it will be sent to a collections agency and reported to credit bureaus but clearly that has already happened. it doesnt appear to be any private collections company involved so i have no idea where the money above the original $872 even came from. ",10
"""don't pay off your mortgage because you have to pay property taxes"".. read an article on msn about why you shouldn't pay off your mortage. one claimed reason was this:

"" the main reason people try to eliminate their mortgage is that pesky monthly payment. let's say you bought your home with a 30-year fixed mortgage and paid every month on time without refinancing. the month after your last mortgage payment, you still have to make a payment on your house. this time you are paying your taxes and insurance. what was once conveniently saved monthly for you by your bank or lending company is now your responsibility. thus that pesky monthly payment you tried to alleviate continues. it is proven that an affordable mortgage payment helps individuals and families run and maintain a personal financial budget. it just helps everyone plan and maintain a financially healthy mindset.""

how can someone possibly get paid to write this trash?

it's still my responsibility to pay taxes and insurance even when i had a mortgage. i've always had to come up with the money. and then he's claiming ""your payment continues"". yes but it's drastically less because i'm not paying principle and interest dumbass!!!

"i'm a 24 year old waitress with an arts degree who just paid off her student loans in seven months thanks to pf advice!. i've read a lot of these 'triumphant' posts about paying loans and it always turns out the person was an engineer and got a huge bonus, or lived at home, or came into inheritance, or something. i was pretty frustrated by this when i started reading pf, because of course those people can pay their loans! i tried to the best of my ability to adhere to the advice on this sub about loans and budgeting and it's working so far. i thought my post could provide some insight for others in similar situations with no safety net. 

i graduated college in 2015 with $15,000 in debt, in four federal loans ranging from 3.5% to 7% interest. i know this isn't a lot of debt compared to the average. i didn't start seriously paying it until december of 2016 and paid it off completely as of today. i left home at 17 and have been in the service industry ever since. i went to a cuny school and got an arts degree in a field i love i don't regret it for a second. what i do regret is that after four years of working full time as a waitress in college just to pay rent ($1000 a month because nyc) and general expenses, i was straight up irresponsible with money for a year after graduating because i finally had free time. i spent from $300 to $800/week drinking and going out. i own a $1000 handbag and yes, i bought a lot of avocado toast. all of my friends had trust funds and could spend hundreds going out and there i was, playing along. i was keeping up with the jonses in the worst way and was breaking even at best. by the time i got serious about finances, i was $3k in credit card debt, too. i was paying the minimum on my loans ($142) with no end in sight. so i did a complete overhaul:

-moved to the west coast. rent is now $650 a month instead of $1000. utilities are $30-50 compared with $100+, no cable. 

-i don't own a car or a bike. i live downtown and walk everywhere. yes, it is limiting, but i spend a maximum of $20/month on uber if i need to. still way cheaper than owning a car, and cheaper than my metrocard in ny. it also forces me to explore my neighborhood and be more creative.

-got a job actually in my field!! but pay was $15 and hour for anywhere between 5 and 25 hours a week. obviously not liveable but something for my resume.

 -so i got a serving job. this was four nights a week, but because i'm not in san francisco or something i was making between $80-150 a night. 

-got another serving job that paid a little better, one night a week and two days (meaning doubles on the weekend) so i was now working monday to friday in the morning at the job in my field, wednesday-friday nights as a server in two restaurants, and doing back-to-back doubles every weekend (9am-1am). 

-i cancelled a $75 gym membership and bought a yoga mat and some weights.

-moving to the west coast helped a lot because my state has a high minimum wage for servers instead of the $5/hr i was making in ny. i think it will help me on taxes next year. 

-i used mint and tracked every. single. penny. i know where every dollar between december and june went and hold myself personally responsible for it. i started making coffee at home. my so and i meal prep together. we go to the reduced price movie night at the local theater, happy hours or bottomless brunches, and any free event our city offers. we are rarely bored! 

-i set my loan autopay to $600/month, and any extra leftover from the month went straight to the loans. i was averaging $1000/week working 7 days a week, in twelve ""shifts."" i paid off the credit cards first and by january was making payments of $1500+ per month to my loans in addition to the autopay. my final payment was for $2k. 

there were a lot of times when it sucked, when i fought with my so about us not taking vacations, when i was neglecting my personal life because i was pretty much always working. it was not easy. but now it's all paid off! i spent a lot of time feeling like i may as well be living in a van down by the river, but seeing the zero balance is extremely satisfying and it was all worth it. i have quit two of my three jobs and am pursuing something in my field without the weight of my loans on my shoulders. i guess i really just wanted to say that not everyone on pf has a trust fund, and it is possible to get your finances in control without one. the best advice is to use mint or a budget tracker and avoid lifestyle creep. i know my debt will seem insignificant to most people, but this was life changing for me. 
**edit - tl;dr:** i paid $15k in loans in 7 months as a waitress by moving to a low col area, working three jobs seven days a week, using a budget, and avoiding lifestyle creep. 


**edit 2: i can't believe the support this post is getting! thank you all for your responses, this is unreal for me. i'm working a double today but i'll be back later tonight and can respond to more of you.**",10
"amazon prime subscription. amazon prime membership costs are going up to $120 a year (from $100). personally, i don't use anything other than 2-day shipping, and i order maybe 20 times a year so i don't think renewing my subscription is a worthwhile investment for me. note: the student price remained unchanged at $60 a year.

"bought a car today. transmission went out 60 miles from the car lot and everyone had gone home for the day. is there any chance i can get a refund?. i was visiting my brother about three hours from home this weekend. saw a car listing i was interested in, went and looked at it, drove and looked great, so i went and got cash from the bank and bought it. this was at about 11:30 am. they closed at noon because it's saturday. i headed home and made it 64 miles before the transmission went out and left me sit on the side of the highway. i had it towed back to the car lot because i was a heck of a lot closer to there than home, and then my wife took me the rest of the way (she was following me in our minivan with our kids.) 

my question is, what are my odds on a refund on this thing? i signed a document saying it was being sold as is, but this is a private dealer and has the guys name on the sign. i guess i'm hoping he has some integrity and cuts me a break considering i didn't even get to drive the thing for an hour. i also took all this money out of my savings so i'll be pretty bummed if it's just a complete loss. a transmission is completely out of the question to replace on this car. 

thoughts? i probably won't hear from this guy until monday so i have to stew about it until then.

edit: i live i indiana if that matters.

edit 2: guy just called me and the first thing out of his mouth was that he was refunding my money. said he was sorry and not a crook about 15 times. guess there really are some good people left in the world.

final edit: just got home with my refund as it was a 5 hour round trip. guy was extremely apologetic and even told me he wasn't legally obligated to do anything but he thought it was the right thing to do. he said he would have sold that car to a family member and was shocked that it happened. to all of you who were telling me to buy him a bottle of something, i am already out a few hundred dollars for the tow bill, not to mention i filled the tank to the brim before it broke. i lost a decent chunk too. guy said he's not going to scrap it, he has too much money into it now so he's just going to replace yhe the transmission. (it had 4 new tires, a new battery and two front wheel bearings just finished) i told him if he can find me something else i will make the drive again to give him business. he has my trust now for sure. also it's against the rules to say the name of the place according to the sub rules. thanks everyone for your advice and comments. take care.",10
"students and young people: do not underestimate the power of a good credit score. i'm moving into my first solo apartment in a couple weeks, and i had to budget for the utility security deposits that many companies require if you lack a history with them. between electric and internet, i was looking at a couple hundred dollars in deposits—spread out gradually over my next few monthly bills. 

however, today, i learned a deposit was not required due to my solid credit score! 

one less headache to worry about, and my budget is a bit more flexible now, and all it took was managing and building credit responsibly. 

edit: of course, this is just one of the minor benefits of a good score. i just wanted to highlight how credit can be a factor sometimes in less salient circumstances

edit 2: this became more popular than i expected! i won't be able to respond to replies today, so check out the wiki on this sub for more information about using credit responsibly. also, credit and debt are two different concepts—it's important to understand the difference. ",10
"student loans - an insider's guide to forgiveness programs. this is meant to be a user-friendly, non-jargon explanation of student loan forgiveness programs - what is possible and what is not; who to trust and who to hang up on. 

**qualifications**: i work for a company under contract with the department of education to service direct loans (loans owned by the us department of education). it's one of the companies listed on this government site:

https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/servicers

 i've worked here for 5.5 years; 3 years in customer service, and 2.5 years in processing repayment plans. 


**disclaimer**: *i do not speak for the us department of education, nor do i speak for any company servicing student loans; i just wanted to give a public service announcement and share the knowledge i've accumulated by working in the industry for over 5 years now. all of this information is publicly available, but it is generally in a hard-to-understand format.*

**some useful terms**

* servicer: a servicer is a company that provides customer service, billing, and processing for student loans. they are the company you call when you have a question about your loan, and the company you submit your documents to. they do not own the loan, and do not make student loan regulations. they are the hands-on company that enforces the rules created by the lenders.

* lender: a lender is the entity that provides the funds for a loan. because they provide the funds and generate the contracts, they make the rules that borrowers and servicers must follow.

* borrower: a borrower is the student (or parent, in the case of parent plus loans) who takes out the student loan.

* third-party company: a third-party company is a company that is not your lender or your servicer. these companies often make cold calls or send unsolicited mail advising people that they can offer forgiveness for student loans. they typically require payments of hundreds of dollars in order to help borrowers complete paperwork (the same paperwork the servicers will help borrowers with for free). the forgiveness programs they offer are already in place based on the type of student loan you have, so they cannot offer any additional forgiveness options. sometimes these companies also offer student loan management services; for example, they might ask for a monthly fee of $35.00 to remind you once a year to renew your repayment plan, although your servicer will send you reminders anyway for free. if you make enough money so that you are comfortable and don't mind paying hundreds of dollars for a small amount of convenience, these companies are fine to work with, but in the case of people who cannot afford to pay at all, it is certainly an extra expense i would advise against.

* forgiveness: forgiveness programs are programs that allow a certain portion of your balance, and occasionally the entire balance, to be written off. sometimes this written-off amount is considered taxable, and sometimes not. forgiveness programs typically are not an immediate type of program; you must meet certain qualifications for years while remaining in good standing on your loan to qualify for forgiveness. i will detail the forgiveness programs and how to apply below.

* discharge: discharge programs, unlike forgiveness programs, cause an entire loan balance to be written off immediately, assuming you meet certain criteria. discharge programs apply when you are considered unable to pay off your loans due to circumstances outside your control.

* subsidies: subsidized student loans are loans that have their interest paid (subsidized) by the government while the loan is under certain conditions, like when you are attending school full time or when you are on a deferment. unsubsidized loans do not have these benefits, except in one scenario (see repaye in the idr plans section).

* deferments: a deferment is a hold on your loan for a specific period of time. in order to qualify for a deferment, you must meet certain qualifications, and you will have to provide documentation for those qualifications. you will qualify for a deferment if you are unemployed and registered with an unemployment agency (not monster.com, but a state labor department), if you are attending school at least half time, if you are working full time and earning less than the poverty guideline for your household size, if you are receiving public assistance, and various other situations. deferments are nice because subsidized student loans do not accrue interest while on deferment. unfortunately, student loans only have a limited amount of deferment time available for each deferment type, typically 3 years.

* forbearance: like deferments, forbearances are holds placed on student loan accounts. typically, it is easier to qualify for a forbearance than a deferment, and it is usually easier to apply because less documentation is required. the problem with forbearances is interest continues to build up on the loan each day (student loans are simple interest loans that accrue interest daily), and it is not covered by the government. like deferments, there is a limited amount of forbearance time available for student loans.


**types of student loans**

* direct loans: most of you will have direct loans, or loans owned by the us department of education. all regular student loans taken out after june 30, 2010 are direct loans. direct loans have some benefits that other loan types do not have. 

* federal family education loan program (ffelp) loans: some of you will have ffelp loans, which are owned by financing companies and banks, but which are federally backed in case of default. some ffelp loans have been transferred and are now serviced by the same companies that service direct loans. there are still federal benefits for these loans, but there are fewer programs available for ffelp loans than for direct loans.

* private loans: a few of you have private loans, which are not federally backed and do not qualify for any of the programs that will be listed here. any loan benefits will be dependent on your lender, just like if you took out an unsecured installment loan at a bank. 

* parent plus loans: parent plus loans are loans taken out by a parent or guardian for a student (not for themselves). these loans can be under the direct loan program or the ffel program. these loans are a bit different because they do not qualify for many of the programs available for other types of student loans. i will address parent plus loans separately in the forgiveness section.

* specific loan categories: stafford loans are student loans taken out by a student for themselves. stafford loans can be direct or ffelp loans. they are usually taken out for undergraduate programs, but occasionally, if a student has not reached their stafford loan limit (set by the us department of education), they can take out unsubsidized stafford loans as a graduate student. graduate plus loans are loans taken out by graduate students who have reached their stafford loan limit. graduate plus loans are always unsubsidized and have higher interest rates than stafford loans do, but ***unlike parent plus loans***, graduate plus loans are eligible for any forgiveness plans available under their loan program, direct or ffelp.

now that we've got all of that terminology out of the way, let's get to the good stuff - 

**forgiveness programs**

discharge options:

* **total and permanent disability (tpd) discharge** (available for both direct and ffelp loans): if you are totally and permanently disabled (i.e. if your doctor certifies that you have a medical condition that will prevent you from working for the next 5 years) you can have your loans discharged. be aware that it can take several months for this process to be complete, so you may want to ask your loan servicer for a forbearance or deferment in the meantime. **how to apply:** it doesn't matter which servicer is in charge of your student loans, you will always apply for tpd through a company called **nelnet.** to apply for tpd, contact nelnet either by visiting their discharge website at www.disabilitydischarge.com or by calling 888-303-7818. if you have taken out a parent plus loan or if you are a student whose parent has taken out a plus loan for you, the loan can be discharged if either the parent or the student is disabled. be aware that the discharged amount can be considered taxable income. that means if you make $10k per year and you have a $50k loan discharged, the next year your income on your tax return might be $60k, and you would be required to pay taxes on that entire amount.

* closed school discharge: we're seeing more of these lately. if you are *attending* or on an *approved leave of absence* from a school that closes, you can have your loan discharged. you may decide to transfer your credits to another school instead, in which case you would not qualify. be aware that you have to actually be attending the school when it closes, or you have to have stopped attending within 120 days of the school closing. if you already graduated or if you stopped attending more than 120 days before the school closed, you will not qualify. **how to apply:** call or email your student loan servicer.

* **death:** this one is sad and seems morbid, but more people than you might expect ask about this. if you have federal student loans, under the direct or ffel programs, your student loans will be discharged when you die. it is not possible for your loans to be transferred to anyone else's name, and your estate will not be billed for the balance. once your servicer receives documentation, usually a death certificate and obituary, the balance is written off.

* **various other discharge types:** the three types above are the most commonly requested discharge types, but student loans can also be discharged for fraud or if the school should not have allowed you to take out student loans because they have no reason to believe a degree would be useful to you (typically occurs when a student does not have a high school diploma or ged). if you think you might be a candidate for discharge, call or email your servicer. they'll be happy to look into it for you. 

forgiveness options:

* **public service loan forgiveness (pslf):** this is the most talked-about forgiveness plan, and there are a lot of misconceptions about it. the pslf program allows borrowers who work in public service (defined as working full time for a non-profit (501(c)(3)) company or a government agency) to pay their loans ***on a qualifying repayment plan*** (more on this in a minute) for ten years (120 payments). once the borrower has made 120 ***qualifying*** payments, the rest of the balance will be forgiven, and will not be considered taxable. here are a few important tips about the pslf program: first, this program is only available for direct loans. if you have a ffelp loan, ***your loan is not eligible for the pslf program.*** you can consolidate your loan under the direct loan program, at which point your new consolidated loan would be eligible, but any payments you make prior to consolidating will not count toward forgiveness. second, there are two main factors for eligibility for the pslf program - your employment has to qualify, and while you're working for a qualifying employer, all of the 120 payments have to be made on a qualifying payment plan. this is where many people have trouble. i've spoken to borrowers who have paid for 7 years on a graduated repayment plan while working for a government agency, all the while assuming that they were going to have their loan forgiven. unfortunately, the graduated plan is not an eligible plan for pslf. eligible plans are an idr plan (more info below) or a standard, 10-year plan. do you see the problem with the standard 10-year plan? if you pay your loans on a 10-year term, your loans will be paid in full by the time you qualify for forgiveness. in order to truly benefit from pslf, you will need to switch your loans to an idr plan. **a few more tips:** payments do not have to be consecutive. if you work for a government agency and take off a couple of years when you have a baby and then start working again, those qualifying payments will still count towards forgiveness, as long as you were paying on a qualifying plan and working for a qualifying employer. payments are only qualifying payments if they are made no later than 15 days after the due date. if you perpetually pay your loan 30 days late, your payments will not count. if you accidentally pay 20 days one month, it's okay because payments do not have to be consecutive. it will take you an extra month, but you will not lose your previous qualifying payments. also, loans forgiven under the pslf program are not considered taxable, unlike loans forgiven under idr plans (see below). **how to apply for pslf:** you are not required to submit an application for pslf until you have made 120 qualifying payments, but you can if you'd like. just complete the form https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/public-service-employment-certification-form.pdf and submit it to **fedloan servicing**. even if your loans are not currently serviced by fedloan servicing, the loans will be transferred there if your employment qualifies, and fedloan servicing will keep track of your forgiveness count. 

* **teacher loan forgiveness (tlf):** if you are a teacher (not a counselor or librarian) and you have taught at a low-income (title i) school for 5 years, you are eligible to have a certain amount forgiven. the amount is usually $5k, but if you are a special education teacher or if you teach math or science at a secondary school the forgiveness can be $17.5k. this program is available for both direct and ffelp loans. the biggest thing to be aware of with this program is that only loans taken out **after october 1, 1998** will qualify. congress created the plan at that time, and only authorized it for new loans that were taken out after. this is a good program, but be aware if you are also interested in the pslf program that you cannot do both at the same time. you can qualify for both forgiveness programs, just for different time periods. for example, if you taught at a title i school from 2005 - 2010 and had $5k forgiven, any payments you made during 2005 - 2010 would not be considered qualifying payments towards the pslf program, but payments made after could be qualifying payments, you would just have to pay for another 10 years, at which point your total balance would be forgiven. **how to apply:** your servicer will have a tlf application on their website. you will need to complete part of the application yourself, and then an ""authorized official"" will need to complete and sign the rest of the form.

* **income-driven repayment (idr) plan forgiveness:** idr plans are plans that base your monthly payment on your income, as well as your household size and your student loan balance. in order to take advantage of the pslf plan, you need to pay your loans under one of the idr plans. these plans are a good option even if you don't qualify for the pslf program, because after paying for 20 or 25 years (depending on which plan you are on; remember that on the pslf plan your balance will be forgiven after 10 years, regardless of the forgiveness term of the idr plan you are on ), your remaining loan balance will be forgiven. there are several idr plans, which i will detail below, but first i will give some general information about these programs. idr plans are meant to make your payments affordable. they are not intended to pay off your loan at a certain time. if you have the means to pay extra and you do not qualify for pslf, an idr plan is probably not for you, because by paying off your loans early you will save a lot of interest. if you cannot afford to pay, then idr plans are a good option. the plans (except for icr) offer interest benefits as well as making payments more affordable. any interest that accrues that is not covered by your monthly payments will be paid by the government on your subsidized loans for the first three years you are on an idr plan. for example, if your loan accrues $50.00 each month but your idr payment is only $10.00 each month, the government will pay $40.00 in interest each month. keep in mind that idr plans are good for 12 months at a time. this means you will have to reapply every 12 months. the timeframe is based on when you originally apply, not on the tax or calendar year, so if you applied in september 2016, you would need to send in your paperwork to renew your plan in august or september 2017. another notice to borrowers with ffelp loans: **income-based repayment (ibr) is the only idr plan available to ffelp borrowers.** if you consolidate your loans under the direct loan program, you will be eligible for any of the idr plans. on to the individual plan descriptions: **income-contingent repayment (icr):** icr is the oldest idr plan; it was developed in the '90s. icr payments are calculated differently than other idr plans, and the payments are typically higher. one exception is for borrowers with very small balances, usually under about $3k or so: icr uses the lesser of a payment calculated based on your income or based on your loan balance, so if your loan balance is small, you may receive a low payment even if you have a decent salary. i've seen borrowers making upwards of $100k/year qualify for payments lower than $50/month on icr. balances are forgiven after paying on icr for 25 years. **income-based repayment (ibr):** ibr is one of the better-known idr plans. it was created in 2009 and had a lot of publicity at the time. payments are calculated based on 15% of your discretionary income (defined as any income you receive that is more than 150% of the poverty guidelines for your household size), unless all of your student loans were taken out on or after july 1, 2014, in which case payments are calculated based on 10% of your discretionary income. the remaining balance is forgiven after paying on the ibr plan for 25 years, unless all your loans were taken out on or after july 1, 2014, in which case the remaining balance is forgiven after paying on ibr for 20 years. one important point about ibr: *if you are on the ibr plan and you want to change to any other repayment plan (except for a standard 10-year plan), you will have to make a special payment before you will be able to exit the plan.* the payment can be as low as $5.00, but you will need to let your servicer know that you are planning to pay to exit ibr. **pay as you earn (paye):** paye was intended to be a plan that improved upon the ibr plan, but unfortunately the eligibility requirements were so stringent that not many people qualified. in order to qualify, you had to have had no student loans prior to october 1, 2007, and you also had to have student loans disbursed after october 1, 2011. while this is more common today, not many people qualified when paye was first released. the payment for paye is calculated based on 10% of your discretionary income and the balance is forgiven after paying on paye for 20 years. **revised pay as you earn (repaye):** repaye is the newest idr plan, and was released in december 2015. repaye is similar to the other idr plan. payments are based on 10% of your discretionary income. forgiveness comes after 20 years if you only have undergraduate loans and 25 years if you took out any loans for graduate school (yes, it's not fair). if you have graduate loans and you qualify for paye even with its weird disbursement requirements, you're probably better off sticking with paye because of 20 year forgiveness. i'm planning on going to graduate school once i graduate nursing school (no, i'm not planning on working with student loans for the rest of my life), so i'm repaying my loans on paye. there are some great benefits to repaye though. like ibr and paye, repaye has interest benefits, but the interest benefits are the best of all the plans. for the first three years, any interest accruing on subsidized loans that is not satisfied by your payments is paid by the government. also, after three years, 50% of the interest not satisfied by your payments on your subsidized loans will be paid by the government. 50% of the unsubsidized interest that is not satisfied by your payments is paid by the government the entire time you are on repaye. this is the only plan where unsubsidized loans receive interest help. an important point to consider about repaye: *if you do not renew your repaye plan on time, then for the period you were not on repaye, your servicer will have to calculate your income and determine what your payment would have been if you had renewed on time. if you would have paid more had you renewed repaye, then the amount you would have paid more for the entire period you were not on repaye will be divided into payments for the remainder of the repaye term and added to your monthly payments.* please renew on time! **how to apply for any idr  plan:** if you have direct loans, you can apply for any idr plan electronically at www.studentloans.gov. your servicer will also have forms available on their website. **an important addendum:** idr forgiveness can be considered taxable income, meaning the amount forgiven will be included in your income and you will have to pay taxes on it the following year. thanks to u/drvoltaselectricfish for pointing this out. 

**for parent plus borrowers:** parent plus loans do not qualify for any idr plan. if you consolidate your loans, you will be able to pay on the icr plan. if you don't have any taxable income, then your monthly payment under the icr plan will be $0.00. please consider consolidating and paying under icr if you have parent plus loans and you are struggling to make your payments.

**how do i know who my servicer is?** go to www.nslds.ed.gov. you'll have to sign in with your fafsa information, which you can reset if you can't remember it. once you've reset everything, i recommend setting up mobile alerts if that's something you're comfortable with. once you're logged in, click on ""financial aid review."" then you can see each student loan you have. just be aware that you might have different servicers for different loans. you can view individual loan information by clicking on the blue numbers on the left. your loan servicer's information will be here as well.

**should i consolidate? how do i consolidate?** if you have lots of student loans with multiple servicers, consolidation can be a convenient solution. be aware that consolidation will not lower your interest rate. your new, fixed, consolidation interest rate will be calculated by taking a weighted average of the interest rates for all of your existing loans, and rounding up to the nearest .125% (thanks to u/mentaldude95 for the correction). **to consolidate,** visit www.studentloans.gov. ***consolidation is free!! never pay to consolidate your loans into a new federal consolidation loan!***


**borrower defense to repayment:** thanks to u/ecc10394 for bringing this up - if you are not eligible for loan discharge due to school closure, but you feel you were unfairly charged tuition by a school that didn't hold up their end of the educational bargain, you may qualify for borrower defense to repayment. quoting directly from www.studentaid.gov:

""under the law, you may be eligible for borrower defense to repayment forgiveness of the federal student loans that you took out to attend a school if that school misled you, or engaged in other misconduct in violation of certain state laws. specifically, you may assert borrower defense by demonstrating that the school, through an act or omission, violated state law directly related to your federal student loan or to the educational services for which the loan was provided. you may be eligible for borrower defense regardless of whether your school closed or you are otherwise eligible for loan forgiveness under other laws.""

well, i'm sure i've missed a few things, but i'd be happy to answer questions. it's not possible to cover everything, but i wanted to make this guide easy to understand. most of all, i just want people to be less stressed about student loans and to be more familiar with the options available to them, so that it's more difficult for predatory companies to charge hundreds of dollars to borrowers who already can't make their student loan payments when the same services are being offered for free. 

https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/ also has a lot of good, in-depth information about student loans. 

hopefully there aren't a bunch of typos, and the formatting is tolerable. 


edit: added tax info for pslf and idr plans, as well as how to apply for pslf and information on borrower defense to repayment loan forgiveness.

"don't underestimate the snowball method – i paid off 16k of balances between 9 cards because of it.. i owe a huge thank you to this sub, you were hard on me a couple yrs ago but told me what i needed to hear, pay off that 16k in cc debt, and do it now – and today i paid off the last of it!


of course i'm excited, but rather than just share a success story, i wanted to point out how important for me the 'feeling' of success was during this >2 year process.  it absolutely was due to the snowball method(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_3.3a_pay_down_high_interest_debts), and with every balance payoff i got a 'high' driving me to keep going as i took that extra money to tackle the next balance.  i also frequented this sub, it kept my focus on finances and frugalness.  and during this process i also documented everything.( http://imgur.com/a/dbmrq)


so, i guess i just want to let people out there know, that if you're newer to taking control of your finances, want to pay-off debt, and think you'll require the physiological boost to keep going (i did), i definitely recommend the snowball method.


**tldr;**

* pay off smaller balances first for earlier psychological 'wins'
* frequent this sub to keep your mind in it 
* document your success along the way


*disclaimer: the avalanche method(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_3.3a_pay_down_high_interest_debts) will cost you less and is the more recommended method as it saves you money.*",10
"i'm being asked to pay for my own stay on business travel over the weekends. this can't be right?. i work for a company based in california (ca) but i don't work in ca normally. i'm being asked to support a test in ca for the next three weeks. 

the problem is, my program manager just informed me that we'll have to cover our own expenses over the weekend because there's insufficient funds in the program budget, including hotel and food. normally i travel to a test site with on campus housing and just stay there and drive home on the weekends. this time i won't be able to drive back and forth and there is no on site housing, so it's never come up.

it doesn't feel right to me. either they have to pay to cover my expenses while i'm up there or to fly me back and forth...right?

edit: this isn't coming from my company, it's from my project. i am an engineer, we have to charge (bill) our hours to specific projects. we don't really have an overhead budget, we bill to projects. my site is low on project funds due to the end of the federal fiscal year. there's plenty of work once the next year of funds are released but that depends on congress. until my next year's funds come in, i have to find other work. this is my other work. 

i just want to know for sure that i can tell my program manager he has to pay for my weekend expenses - google has not been helpful so i figured i'd ask you guys in case someone knew so i have the answer before i go talk to management.

"wells fargo will ""post items presented against the account in any order the bank chooses"".. tl;dr: wells fargo posted charges to my account in most to least expensive (not the order they were made), causing 4 overdraft fees plus penalties, totalling $176 instead of 1 fee totalling $35. this is company policy.

this actually happened a few years ago, but a recent reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/88unax/if_youre_ripped_off_by_comcast_or_any_internet/) made me look into it again.

below is an excerpt from a letter sent to wells fargo at the time:

""on march 20th, i made 4 purchases, and apparently, due to the fact that someone i had brought from days earlier had not drawn on my account yet, i miscalculated my funds available, and became overdrawn. 

there were 4 overdraft fees, which in turn led to several continuous od fees.

but these overdraft fees were not applied to my account until march 25th and 26th, despite the fact that all 4 purchases which led to the fees were made on the 20th (and i have paper receipts to verify this.). 

at the time, i had over $600 in my other account, which i'd have been happy to draw on to cover the funds, but i was under the impression that credit card transactions were instant – a view that was re-enforced when i got home that night and saw one of the charges (for hertz rent a car) already applied to my account. that charge was for around $300, which was more than i expected, and i intended to question it. 

the next day it was gone, and i assumed hertz had realised their mistake and were in the process of correcting it. but it does show why i believed that there was no delay by hertz in processing the transaction.
 
none of the other transactions appeared to be even ""pending"", and i had no way of anticipating when they would appear. 

then suddenly, all 4 transactions went through at once, and wells fargo put the biggest transaction through first, causing all the others to bounce. had they put the smallest through first, only the most expensive one (hertz) would have bounced. this caused 3 more overdraft fees than were necessary.""

wells fargo's response was (in part) as follows:

""in our consumer account agreement (caa) effective november 2008 regarding the order of posting, the bank may post items presented against the account in any order the bank chooses, unless the laws governing your account either requires or prohibits a particular order. for example, the bank may, if it chooses, post items in the order of highest to dollar amount to lowest dollar amount. the bank may change the order of posting items to the account at any time without notice. enclosed is a copy of page 22 from our caa for your review.""

personally, i find this practice disgraceful, and am no longer a customer. if you find this as offensive as i do, or if it has ever happened to you, please consider writing to them, and spreading this information.

"your friendly reminder that credit score is not an indicator of overall financial health, nor should you pay interest just to bump your score. hello friendos, and welcome back to another coolkid psa post. credit score can be stressful and even confusing to some people, so i'd like to clarify a few facts about the responsible use of credit, paying interest just to bump up your score, and the concept of diminishing returns. please note, this guide assumes you've at least *glanced through* the ""credit"" wiki. 

- responsible use. start here if you have no credit history or really bad credit. get a secured credit card, preferably one which you would like to use as a regular credit card as well, and put all gas/groceries/misc living expenses on it. pay off in full every month to reap the cash back/travel miles/points without paying interest. repeat until you get upgraded to unsecured.

myth time!: many people believe carrying a small balance on your credit card every month benefits credit score. untrue! if anything, it *decreases* your score by increasing usage %

edit for clarity: *carrying a balance* means leaving a small balance on your credit card, past the due date, and paying the interest on it. i am *not* advocating for opening a card and then not ever using it. 

- paying interest just to bump your score. i've seen several people, even users of this forum, advocating for taking out a small personal loan or car loan *for the sole purpose of increasing credit score*. this is entirely irresponsible. while it does work, *paying interest in order to bump your credit score doesn't pay off*. why, you might ask? because of the concept of...

- diminishing returns! if your score is anywhere within the 750s/760s range, you already qualify for the best deals, lowest interest rates, etc. please note, *even if you are lower than this*, i still wouldn't advocate for paying interest. 

myth time 2: the electric bogaloo!: many people believe that using the above tactics to increase credit score before a big purchase, such as a car loan or mortgage, will pay off in the end due to a decreased interest rate on that bigger loan. a) car loans are getting lower and lower, with many credit unions boasting a 1% or even 0% interest rate with a semi-decent score. b) mortgages can be refinanced. c) using normal credit repair tactics, without paying interest, usually has the exact same effect with a *marginally* longer pay off time.

edit: ok folks, yikes. i'm catching a lot of flak for my statements on housing and down payments, so i'm removing it. see my other post(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6og0ax/countering_the_rent_is_just_throwing_away_money/) on ""rent is not throwing away money"" for more on this if you're curious.

"update usps lost our money order, landlord says we need to write a new check monday. really need advice.. well thank god, the money orders showed up in our mail today with a note that says ""need to pay postage."" i guess when my roommate went and did the orders she didn't think of that and couldn't remember that she hadn't done so and for whatever reason had the excuse that the postal service was at fault. regardless of all of this, i'm just so relieved that we 1. have the money back 2. i am not entirely broke anymore and 3. my roommate isn't a thief. i am going to take nearly everyone's simultaneous advice and never pay rent with money order ever again. from now on *i* will pay the super myself directly. if anyone's curious about how the interaction at usps went this morning, i showed up with the pay stub and explained the situation and was told there was nothing they could do aside from wait up to 60 days to see if it had been cashed. thank you all so so much for the advice this stupid 18yo so desperately needed.

"nearly lost entire house downpayment to a scammer: verify your wires!. i narrowly avoided being scammed out of the entire amount of my house downpayment by a fraudulent email that looked very similar to an email that my lawyer would send. it looked so good, all the right details where there. i was even talking about the last closing details with the lender this morning.  

i scheduled the wire but then realized my ""something is fishy"" internal alarm was going off. i called the lawyers office and confirmed that the account number on the wire transfer information was not their account, and that they hadn't sent me wire instructions. the scammer had nearly every critical detail about the house closing in the ""closing disclosure"". the right ""from:"" name on the email, but i noticed that the email address was not from my lawyer's domain. once i confirmed that this was a scam, i had a very tense few minutes calling the bank to try to stop the wire transfer from completing. thankfully i got the wire canceled before it was sent.

i learned a very valuable lesson today. never wire money without calling the main office to confirm, even if all the details look correct in the email. if that wire had gone out to the scammer, the house closing would have to be canceled, and i would be out major money. once a wire has left the building, it's gone.

now i get to investigate and escalate a major breach of information somewhere between my lawyer and the lender's office working on this file.  turns out the disclosure form they sent me was the exact disclosure form that my lawyer shared with the bank yesterday... so something is breached. 

verify your wires. 
listen to the little voice that says ""something is fishy"". 

fuck, that was close guys.

edit: also locked my credit for the time being. i asked the lender if they need it again and they said no.

edit: i know it wasn't my email that was compromised because they used a document i hadn't received up to that point. it was only sent between the lender and the lawyer. i also use the best email security i know how to: 2fa with authenticator (not sms), one time codes in my safe if i ever lose my phone, strong unique password that i rotate regularly and is managed by 1password.",10

"u.s. education department says many student loan forgiveness letters may be invalid. tl;dr: in 2007, the federal government established a student loan forgiveness program for grads who went into public service jobs. after 10 years of service, those loans could be forgiven. lots of people took jobs with that expectation.

well, it's 10 years later, and now the education department says that its own loan servicer wrongly approved a bunch of people for debt forgiveness, and without appeal, will now reject them, leaving their loans intact.

bottom line: if you have debt forgiveness through this program (as i know many who do), you're gonna want to check your paperwork reeeeeeeal carefully.

"advice to new graduates and those that are just turning 18 - get a new bank account that is in your name only.. due to regulations, minors are generally required to have a parent or other legal adult listed on their bank accounts. once you turn 18, you should establish a bank account that is in your name only. this new account should also be at a separate bank/credit union from the previous account in order to prevent any mistakes from bank personnel that may give a parent access to the new account.

there are multiple horror stories that you can find about people who have their accounts drained due to actions by their parents. the parents take the money to punish, they use it for their own needs, or they have judgements against them which cause all the money in the accounts to be used to satisfy the debts. despite who earned the money in the accounts, if more than one name is on the account, legally it belongs to both parties.

having a separate account doesn't mean that the parents can't put money in. all they need the account info on it to deposit funds. other excuses may be well-meaning, but at the end of the day it's not necessary to have the parent on the account of the newly adult child.",10

"gym sold my bank account to another gym, $500 charge. hello, i woke up this morning to two separate charges that add up to $490 to my checking account. it was to, let's call it gym a.  i'm not a member there, had to look it up to even locate it. it's in my town. 

i call bank first thing to dispute the charge and freeze account for fraudulent activity.  since it is a bank draft i need to go to the branch to shut down that account to prevent future withdrawals.

i got suspicious and tried calling my gym that i still pay a monthly 11 dollars membership to see if they are affiliated with gym a. turns out they went out of business (like i said, i hadn't been there in awhile).  i called another branch of my gym and asked if they were affiliated with gym a. the guy tells me that the other branch sent their members to gym a after they went out of business. however the charge this morning was roughly 5x what i was paying in a year!

my question is, should i go to gym a to try to resolve this or just let the bank make me a new checking account. a complicating factor is i get paid on friday via direct deposit and this may be too close to change accounts without disrupting my cash flow. i feel like gym a acted in a fraudulent manner and that my gym had no right to sell my account, especially my bank account to another gym. 

advice please?

edit: if people haven't seen my reply below, here's the gist. i called the gym that sent the charges. talked to the manager, he looked up my info was very apologetic. their system charged me for the last 9 months plus 25 bucks a month late fees. whether this is true or bs, i don't know. however he said he put in a refund today which should process tomorrow morning. i cancelled my stop on the original amount which apparently holds up the refund process. tomorrow morning i should wake up to a refund. i'll update tomorrow.",10
"when budgeting, add a column in your spreadsheet alongside your budget categories. calculate in that column the number of hours it takes your family to work to earn that budgeted amount in that category. it adds perspective and depth to your budget for you/the family.. it is especially helpful for free-spenders in the family to conceive a cause-and-effect relationship between work and money management. 



**edit:** thanks to everyone for the kind comments. i'm hoping to reply to comments as quickly as i can. i'm happy to have helped some with my post. 

**i wanted to add a suggestion for those who get paid on salary/commission/irregular income:**

use your total take home pay for the previous month (or the average take home pay from the previous quarter), and use this in your calculation as your take home pay.  

create a column to calculate the percentage of your take home pay that that budget category/expense represents. it makes each category a piece of a pie that is your take home pay. 

use this information to help decide if that piece is too big. if you see your fast food/clothing/car payment is too high of an overall percentage, you can make adjustments in your spending habits to better utilize your income (and avoid upward spending trends in certain areas of your life). ",10
"i received an accidental mail with all salaries for everyone in the company. hey, first time posting here. hope this post will be ok.

this is problematic in regards to personal information discretion, but my issue is:

i realized i'm being significantly underpaid in comparison to others who do the same work as me. 

i feel frustrated and upset about that fact. not sure how to approach from here. 

how would you approach the situation?

i have chosen to simply delete and bury the faulty email, and i will add a bit about being careful to not forward email-chains in our security newsletter this month instead. this way it will benefit everyone in the company to be wary of forwarding email-chains. the whole chain will be forwarded.

"company accidentally sent me employee payroll information: found out i'm being paid vastly less than my colleagues. hi /r/ personal finance

i live overseas and recently i started working with a new company.  about two weeks ago i received an email with some information that needed to be reviewed by hr and one item (out of many) ended up being partial company payroll information for employees in my department.  my best guess is that the file was accidentally saved under the wrong title.

no one knows i have this information.  what is shocking was to see how little i'm earning in salary compared to several colleagues.  i'm the new head of my department but i'm not earning close to what several other employees are earning; even some with lessor positions.  those with equal-ish footing to my role are essentially earning about twice to three times the amount i earn.

obviously i want to now renegotiate my salary and a better package; but as i'm new to the company i want to proceed with some caution. 

not sure the best way to go about this to keep myself protected, increase my salary, and to avoid this biting me in the ass somehow.

any advice?

**edits**

didn't expect so many messages this morning.  to answer a few questions, i should point out a few things.

1. my job pays 6 figures and is above the current market rate. 

2. the payroll information indicates monthly compensation, not ytd

3. the payroll information indicates people hired within the last 1 year to company. not for all employees

4. the information is for people locally in my office; so not factoring in cost of living for discrepancies.

5. there is no currency difference

6. this is not typical u.s. ""at will employment"" as some people are saying.  however, as an expat in a foreign country, i'm aware i have many limitations/lack of protections.

6. the information received is accurate

i don't care about pay discrepancies of $10k or $20k; however this is double and triple my earnings; this is not cross-departments either; this is in my department and i oversee many of these people.

market-wise; yes i'll be looking for other employment as a back-up, but my earning wage is higher than market rates and my industry is a bit unique.

my interest was to get advice on the best way to go about increasing my salary to these new levels; with the information i have.  not necessarily by tomorrow!  

**edit 2**

because seniority keeps being brought up .  this payroll information only includes the people ***newly hired during the last 1 year***.  the company starting date is listed on the document, and i've been able to confirm that information is accurate.

also, i'm located in asia - this is not an expat relocation package.  i live here and the people in my office are also from said country.  

pay differences aren't a big deal.  however, 2x to 3x pay difference is a big deal.  salary was negotiated, i'm earning more than my counterparts at different companies of the same industry.  been in this industry for 10+ years and know the market rates. 

my information is listed on the document, so i can see how the calculation is being done.  

edit 3

lot more response than i expected.  will do an update post later and include some more information to better clarify the situation.",10
"eli30: personal finance tips for thirty-something adults (us). back with another installment in our series of simple lifestage-appropriate tips based on us situations.  this assumes you have read eli18(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tfc76/eli18_personal_finance_tips_for_young_adults_us/) and eli22(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tlqsd/eli22_personal_finance_tips_for_older_young/).  

topics here, while relevant to ""thirty-somethings"", are appropriate for anyone with a stable financial situation.  remember that marriage, homeownership, etc., are options, not requirements. 

marriage changes your legal situation and, consequently, your  financial options.  

- your married / single tax filing status(https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/irs-tax-return/should-you-and-your-spouse-file-taxes-jointly-or-separately-/inf20137.html) is determined by your december 31 situation.   joint taxes may vary a bit(https://www.learnvest.com/2011/01/the-most-important-decisions-youll-ever-make-marriage-edition/) vs.  single, but should be much better than filing married separately, except for certain income-based student loan repayment scenarios.  with two incomes, withhold taxes as ""married at single rate"" to simplify your w4. 

- ownership of assets / debts is complex and varies by state, but in the majority of cases: individuals retain assets and debts they had before marriage (e.g. student loans), whereas both parties share ownership(http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/separate-community-property-during-marriage-29921.html) of assets and debts acquired during the marriage.  if a marriage ends, there is legal framework for separating assets / debts(http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/dividing-property-debt-during-divorce-faq-29127.html), which differs vs. owning an asset or debt jointly outside of marriage.

- you'll have some additional options regarding health insurance and social security benefits(http://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/articles/2014/03/10/how-marital-status-affects-retirement-benefits).  

- marriage financial lpts include: do not go into debt for a ring / wedding(https://www.theknot.com/content/how-to-pay-for-a-wedding) / honeymoon; decide how to use  joint accounts(http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2015/08/14/the-case-for-and-against-spouses-having-joint-checking-accounts); make big decisions together(http://finance.youngmoney.com/credit_debt/money_management/saving/money-talk-before-marriage/), including what constitutes a big decision. 

one of those big decisions could be buying a house.   here's some information on buying a house(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/housing) that applies to couples as well as single people.  

- house buying usually involves thousands in transaction costs(http://www.moolanomy.com/6279/the-cost-of-buying-and-selling-a-home/),  so don't keep paying those if you move frequently.  as a rule of thumb, buy only when you will stay in the same house for at least five years(https://www.mortgageloan.com/five-year-rule-and-buying-home-9690).  don't  buy just because you don't like paying rent; while rent doesn't build equity, it also avoids maintenance and repair expenses, allows greater location flexibility, and doesn't require a down payment.  early mortgage payments are 75%+  interest, insurance and taxes, and only 25% equity.  property price appreciation is not guaranteed, but if you  live somewhere for 20+ years, ownership is almost certain to build wealth over time.   here's a calculator(http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) to do some what-if's.  

-   while mortgage criteria(https://www.capitalone.com/home-loans/mortgage/approval-criteria)  vary by lender, you need  stable income history(http://blog.credit.com/2014/07/why-your-job-matters-when-buying-a-home-88105/) (two+ years), a good credit score(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/how-credit-scores-impact-your-mortgage-rate-1.aspx) (700ish), low debt to income ratio(https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/debt-to-income-calculator/) (all monthly debt payments below ~35% of gross income), and usually a significant down payment.  one rule of thumb is your house should cost less than three times your annual income.  edit: ok, we'll let you have 4x, counting just the mortgage, if you are in a low-property tax state.  no illinois or new jersey!

- there are many types of mortgages.  you usually want a fixed-rate(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/arm-vs-fixed-rate-mortgage-1.aspx) mortgage to lock in current attractive rates in case you stay in your house for many years.  a 30-year mortgage might have about a 4% rate; each $100k of mortgage would cost $477/month for principal and interest.  with a 15-year mortgage, you'd get a lower rate but higher payments; at 3%, each $100k would be $691/month.  the 15-year saves you an enormous amount  after 15 years when payments stop; until then, it costs you more out of pocket, as you build equity.  it's worth shopping around to get the best rate on a long loan.  

- principal and interest isn't the only cost.  you'll also pay  property taxes and insurance, which can add ~20% to these payments, varying by location(https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-the-highest-and-lowest-property-taxes/11585/), and could be higher.  all condos, most townhouses, and some standalone houses also have monthly homeowner association(http://www.mortgagecalculator.org/helpful-advice/hoa-fees.php) (hoa) fees for maintenance / repairs, that can be several hundred / month.  even with a fixed-rate mortgage, you'll find that taxes, insurance and hoa fees often increase year over year. 

- the gold standard in down payments is 20% of the house price, though many people put down a smaller amount.  some types of mortgages like va(https://www.veteransunited.com/va-loans/) and fha(https://www.usbank.com/home-loans/mortgage/fha-mortgages.aspx) allow lower down payments,  but limited to certain borrowers, or with extra costs.  for a conventional mortgage, you will usually pay private mortgage insurance(http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/122/what-is-private-mortgage-insurance.html) (pmi) if you have less than a 20% downpayment.  on a typical-size mortgage, this could be $100-200/month.  we recommend you save for your downpayment, but gifts from family members are also acceptable to lenders. 

- adding all that up: that $200k mortgage on a $220k condo isn't just $950 /month for the loan, but also $200 for taxes,  $250 for hoa / insurance, and $100 for pmi, so $1500 / month all told. 

- buying a house often gives you enough deductible interest and property taxes to allow itemizing deductions(http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/homeowner-tax-deductions-29693.html), but only the amount of deductions that exceeds the standard deduction is your net advantage.  i.e. if a couple can itemize $20k in deductible interest and taxes (including income tax), they benefit by a net $7400 deduction and save perhaps $1500-2000 in taxes annually.  

children are another popular thirty-something decision.  here are some ways children affect your finances:

- children are expensive.  even if they don't eat a lot, they add costs(http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/tools/crc_calculator/) for housing, health insurance and especially child care; potentially $10-15,000 annually for the first child; less per child beyond that.  many working couples find  child care costs their biggest expense after housing.  family health care premiums can approach $1000/month in some cases.  as a parent, married or not, you must budget for child-support-related costs at least until children reach age 18.

- on the plus side, children can reduce taxes.  a family of four with two children gets $28,000+ in untaxed income as  standard deductions and personal exemptions(https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch03.html) in any event, more if they can itemize.  then you could qualify for the child tax credit(https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/family/7-requirements-for-the-child-tax-credit/inf15610.html) and the child and dependent care credit(https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/family/the-ins-and-outs-of-the-child-and-dependent-care-tax-credit/inf27554.html), which can be worth thousands of dollars annually. 

- we'll discuss longer-term issues like college in a future installment; you have some time and  options here.  but we must cover life insurance(http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/2014/02/26/which-is-better-for-you-term-or-permanent-life-insurance) now.  if you have children (or significant responsibilities to your spouse, etc), you need life insurance.  term life insurance pays in the event you die, but otherwise expires after the ten- to twenty-year term.  other types of insurance don't expire, but are much more expensive over time so are not the best choice for most people.  (even if an old college friend tries to sell you this.)  in round numbers, you may need $500k to $1m death benefit; that much 20-year term life for a 30-year-old is around ~~$50~~ $30/month(https://www.jrcinsurancegroup.com/life-insurance-rates-by-age/), but it varies, so shop around.  you  also need disability insurance; you are more likely to be disabled than to die early, with loss of income plus high medical bills.

- speaking of mortality, when you have children, you also need to have a will(http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2012/09/26/important-things-to-consider-when-preparing-your-will), whether or not you think you have a lot of assets to distribute. in the absence of a will, a court will decide what happens to your children if you e.g. get killed in a car accident, as roughly 100 people do every day.  

even if you don't want a house, spouse, or kids, you may have other financial events to deal with.  let's close with two popular scenarios: job change, and self-employment income:

- you are probably going to change jobs several times in your career.  it's a good way to increase income(http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/02/job-switchers-raise/460044/), statistics tell us.  when you do change, you might have other financial ripples, such as moving costs, so take that into account.  what do you do with your 401k and your employer healthcare?

- you own your 401k, net of unvested employer contributions.  when you leave a job, you have options(http://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/articles/2014/05/27/what-to-do-with-a-401-k-when-you-change-jobs).  you can leave the money in the old employer's plan (but not contribute);  roll it over any amount without tax or penalties into an ira, either traditional or roth as your 401k was; sometimes roll it into your new employer's 401k (but that depends on them); or you could in theory cash it out.  never cash it out.  that defeats the purpose of retirement savings.  the ira rollover is the typical recommendation, although it can affect your ability to do backdoor roth(http://www.rothira.com/what-is-a-backdoor-roth-ira) contributions.  

- switching employers often means changing healthcare plans.  this can mean higher (or lower) premiums, and resetting your deductible for the year.  you may have to bridge a short coverage gap(http://www.insure.com/health-insurance/job-change-and-obamacare.html); you can do this at low costs without paying penalties.  your hsa stays with you whether or not you have an hdhp at the new job.  

self-employment deserves its own post, and we've neglected it 'til now.  let's cover the high-level points to partially rectify that:

- self-employment (1099) income is when you are paid for work without being an employee (w2).  you could be a contractor, take cash side jobs, or otherwise get paid without withholdings.  you owe income taxes as well as self-employment taxes(https://www.irs.gov/individuals/self-employed) in lieu of social security / medicare employee taxes; these are annoyingly large at 15.3% without a standard deduction until you reach 118k total income, after which it drops to just medicare at 2.9%.  you can owe 40% on self-employment income  when you also have a regular job in the 25% bracket.  

- the good news is you can deduct related expenses(https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/deducting-business-expenses)  from your taxable net self-employment income, whether or not you can itemize otherwise.  this can include mileage to/from the job; home office space; cost of computers, cell phones, etc.; travel expenses, education expenses, it's a long list.  carefully track these to correctly fill out your schedule c.

- the not-so-good news is you have to directly pay taxes yourself, using quarterly estimated taxes(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/the-skinny-on-paying-estimated-taxes-1.aspx) if your self-employment income is significant.  you use your crystal ball, figure out what you will owe in taxes for the year, and then send in part of that money in april, june, september and january.  (you can increase regular job withholding to avoid quarterly estimated taxes on small self-employment income.) 

- self-employed people have more and better options for retirement accounts(https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people), oddly enough.  you get more control and higher contribution limits, and you can even make your own 401k, but you have to do it yourself.  since you're your own employer.    

- most self-employed people don't need any special  legal business status.  you can remain a sole proprietor(https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/sole-proprietorships)  and report your taxes as personal income.  you establish a limited liability company(https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc) for liability reasons, but it doesn't change your taxes.  to do that, you'd establish a corporation, such as an s-corp(https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations), which gives you some alternatives that can reduce your tax liability.  

ok, that's enough for today.   i know you are all eager to hear about other types of investments, so we'll save that for the next installment(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uuejg/eli40_personal_finance_tips_to_make_best_use_of/).",10
"opinion - every possible everyday expense should be put on credit cards with the intention of paying in full every month.. i'm 23 years old, had a credit card since i was able to open an account with discover at the age of 18. for 5 years i've never paid an annual fee, never paid any other type of fee, and never paid a single cent of interest. in other words, i've only ever made money (cash back) off of my credit card (which, after paying off student loan and car debt a couple years ago, became credit cards for the different rewards- i now only use credit cards for all of my expenses). my credit score is decently high for only having 5 years total credit history, and a lower average credit history. 

i have several friends/coworkers who think i'm insane for never using a debit card and only ""racking up"" credit card balances because they seem to associate credit cards with negative consequences. however, i keep my balances at less than 10% of my total credit limit, i don't pay any fees or interest, and my rewards are being earned on everyday purchases i would be making anyway, from 1.5% on everything to 3% on groceries to 5% on rotating categories. 

am i crazy here? it seems as though discover, amex, visa would all really like it if i would pay just the minimum every once in a while and pay 15% interest on the balance. but i obviously never do, the only money they make off of me is the fee they charge to the vendor. from my perspective, it's only people who don't understand the benefits of credit or the consequences of not paying in full every month that are losing out on rewards or racking up debt.",10
"my partner was driving for lyft, got in a minor accident, we have full coverage with liberty mutual insurance, but they won't offer any assistance since the accident occurred during a ride share. not sure what to do now, or if this is the correct sub to ask for advice.. expanded version: last saturday night, my partner had passengers in her car when she got in a minor collision with another (ironically) lyft driver who was between rides. my partners car had substantial damage, and was undrivable. since the accident happened at an intersection where a local rapid commute light rail track ran through, local transit authorities called a tow company on their own accord, which promptly came and stole her vehicle to be taken to a tow yard while we were on the phone with our insurance making arrangements for our own tow truck that insurance would cover. the officer on scene deemed no driver was at fault, and did not make a report. now 3 days have passed, and the car is still in the tow yard, racking up storage fees. our insurance doesn't want to touch the case since it was a lyft incident, and won't even cover a rental car while we get everything sorted out. today, finally, someone got in touch with us from lyft saying they will not cover any towing or storage fees ($300), and they have a $2,500 deductable. we are both college students, and while financially responsible, cannot afford that kind of money for repairs. does anyone have any advice to offer for what to do next? we feel as though we have exhausted all options, filing claims with both sides, but getting shut down either way we go. any advice is appreciated. 

edit - thank you all for your contributions to the post. even just having someone else pitch their opinion on the case is reassuring for us. ultimately it all boils down to us taking a financial hit, but this is a huge lesson to everyone who drives for a ride share company to check insurance coverage. i will be spreading awareness of this on social media so others don't get caught in the trap. ✌️",10

"i made a google sheet to replace quicken. *disclaimer: this sheet has no script, no hidden cells, no hidden formula.*

quicken user for 20+ yrs. 2 months ago, my 2016 quicken was expiring and i decided to develop a spreadsheet to replace quicken. my sheet has been working great for 2 months so i've decided to share with the public. obviously, i had to remove my personal data. and i also removed several complex functions so that anyone can understand the core formulas and modify to suit their needs. 

**link to bare bone version:**
  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rt14nzyb3ocz2jlqnjap3ykhv7r25ipjjkqiyvvmbfs
  
this basic version has 5 tabs:  
  
1. net worth (or account balances)  
months in rows, accounts in columns  
  
2. income expense   
months in rows, categories in columns  
  
3. portfolio (# of shares, prices)  
months in rows, securities in columns  
  
4. data1 (for entering bank/cc/loan transactions)  
columns: account, date, payee, category, amount  
  
5. data2 (for entering investment transactions)  
columns: account, date, type, symbol, price, shares, $ amount  
  
**how it works:**  
  
enter bank/cc/loan transaction data into ""data1"" and investment transactions into ""data2"". (this copy has a fictional example for demonstration. see #16 below to semi-automate data entry.)   

  
then the google sheet auto-updates the 1st 3 report tabs    
  
""income expense"": pivot table calculating how much you spent on each category, each month  
""portfolio"": =sumifs(shares, security, date) calculates how many shares you own at any given month. then =googlefinance() pulls historical end of month security prices. multiplied by # of shares to calculate the value for each security, each month  
""net worth"" =sumifs(amount, account, date) calculates end of month balances for every account  
  
**additional functions/features** (you may add the following to this basic version. i'm not willing to share my full version with these features because of privacy. but i'm willing to explain how to add these features below. just ask.):
  
1. ""dashboard"" tab to display the current account balances, line/bar/pie charts for portfolio value/spending/asset allocation (similar to quicken homepage)  
2. double clicking a cell in pivot chart creates a new tab displaying only the corresponding transactions   
3. ""running balance"" for account reconciliation  
4. use ""filter"" in pivot table to exclude unwanted categories such as ""transfer"" in spending report  
5. accrual-basis accounting (vs cash-basis). for example, tax refund received on 4/15/2019 should be recognized as for year 2018 (not 2019).   
6. expensing a large item purchase (eg. car, property tax) over time (vs lumpsum expense)  
7. split transaction (eg. mortgage pmt = interest expense + principal pmt)  
8. recognize gross income (vs net income)  
9. dividend/capital gains income  
10. cost-basis, unrealized capital gains, dollar-weighted return  
11. asset allocation (eg. stock vs bond %)  
12. data validation (selecting field from a list)  
13. =importrange() (useful if your data becomes too large)  
14. =iferror() (to hide #n/a results)  
15. excel doesn't support =googlefinance() to pull historical prices. as of now, excel can only pull current information instead. this will not help with calculating the portfolio value as of 3/31/2019. to use excel, consider using the last recorded price or a 3rd party add-in. 
16. download transaction csv files from websites and copy/paste data (vs hand entry). if you are willing to share passwords, consider mint, tillerhq to import data.
17. learn how to convert qif to csv, if you are migrating from quicken  
18. sort transactions in descending vs ascending date order  
19. conditional formatting based on account name in data tabs  
20. use ""define named range"". for example, use ""dates"" instead of ""data1!$b:$b"" in commands. easier to refer and debug. 
21. use google form to enter transaction data at point of purchase.

let me know if you want to know more about these with examples.

**update1**: there are no hidden commands. to be transparent, i removed blank rows/columns and conditional formatting. also use ctrl + ` keys to see all the commands. just add more rows/columns, as needed.

**update2**: some requested an xls version. today, i attempted xls version from scratch but faced 2 setbacks:  
1. excel doesn't have a built-in command to pull ""historical"" stock prices, which is needed to calculate the portfolio values for a given date. possible solutions: a) use google sheet to collect price data and copy paste manually. b) use 3rd party add-in or vb.

"treat paying off debt like earning a raise.. i have been talking to a good friend about this idea for a while and he just doesn't seem to get it and i don't know why. i really want to help motivate him towards attaining the life he wants for himself and his family.

to me, the amount of student loans my wife and i have are the biggest obstacle between us and the life we want to live. saying goodbye to $600 of our hard-earned after-taxes dollars kills me every month. that's why we live incredibly frugally and have a singular focus of being debt free by the age of 30 (we're 26 and have around $50k left).

a year or so ago i was in a real motivational slump when it came to paying off debt. it happens. but then one day i started adding up all of the monthly payments we no longer had either due to trimming the budget (bye, hulu) or paying off credit card balances, our cars and other things. that's when i realized that the amount of monthly payments we no longer have to make is around $700! using this nifty little calculator(https://www.omnicalculator.com/business/salary-to-hourly) for some helpful visualization i realized that the $700 per month was as if we gave ourselves a $4.04/hr raise over the last three years. or, put another way, $8.4k annually (after taxes).

life is hard, debt sucks and it often seems insurmountable. especially if the total number is in the tens of thousands owed. how much of a raise would you be giving yourself by paying it off? any other mental tricks/illustrations you guys would recommend to help motivate a friend into not thinking their own debt situation is hopeless?

"my boss offered me my first salary position and expects me to counter his offer. what do i counter with if i'm already satisfied with his offer?. title pretty much says it all. the restaurant that i work for is coming under new ownership at the end of this week, and the new owner is promoting me to the general manager position. this is my first job that will be paid salary, not hourly, and my boss told me he expects me to counter his first offer, so i can gain experience with how contract negotiations will work in the future. however, the raise i'll be getting is significant already, plus he has told me i'll be getting a week's worth of vacation per year (which is a week more than i have now), so it all sounds pretty great to me already! what else should i negotiate for? is a week of vacation a normal amount? any guidance is appreciated! 

edit: thank you so much for all of your advice and kind words! i did not expect this post to garner so much attention so i really appreciate it. i've got a good list of things started here but i'd like to know more about tuition reimbursement if anyone has any knowledge to offer on that. i'm 23, about to graduate college, staring down the barrel of $60,000 in student loans and counting. are there any benefits to him tax-wise or anything if he were to make a contribution? should i only ask for a small amount? i have no idea how that works so any advice regarding tuition reimbursement would be appreciated!

"check for $1900 that isn't mine was deposited into my account.. 3 days ago a check for $1900 was deposited into my account. i figured the bank had just messed up but when i called and asked about it they said they didn't see a problem, and that it was my account number on the check. the check was mail deposited without a completed deposit slip. there is no recipient name, just the senders name which i do not recognize. 

i asked what i should do and the guy i was talking to and his supervisor said to wait about 4-5 days, and if the check clears the money should be mine. ??? why would they tell me this when i've told them i don't know where the money came from? what do i do?

edit: i do have access to a picture of the check. a couple things: it isn't hand written, my account number is clearly printed on the check. under ""pay to the order of"" it just says my bank name, i also don't recognize the name or address of the sender. it's from a completely different state. the number for the bank the check came from is also on it. 

i think i'm going to wait a bit to see if it clears. if that happens then i'll probably call the number on the check and ask about it. for sure will not be sending anyone any money, if they want it back they'll have to reverse the check.",10
"what am i supposed to do when my boss tells me i should ""think about whether or not i want to be here"" at my job?. i expressed some serious dissatisfaction recently in a comment on an ""anonymous"" employee survey at my job. my boss talked to us in a staff meeting about the results of the survey and expressed a lot of concern over ""some comments"" (mine) and encouraged us to talk to her about any issues we have because she felt uncomfortable not addressing the issues head-on. feeling like it wouldn't be fair to just leave it hanging like that, i scheduled a meeting with her.

in the meeting, we discussed my issues at length, which mostly have to do with the attitude of my immediate supervisor. but at the end she said to me pretty firmly, ""i'm not trying to push you out, but i want you to take some time to think about whether or not you really want to be here. there are a lot of opportunities out there.""

the truth is, i do want to leave, but i've been applying to jobs for 6 months and have only gotten one interview, and they didn't even bother to send me a rejection letter. seriously, no one will hire me. i have some savings, but i've been trying to keep that so that i can invest it and actually have something for retirement. i'm making under $40k at this job as it is. 

is this a sign i should just up and quit my job without another one lined up? i'm so depressed. i guess i could move another city over and live with my parents again, but jesus, i'm 28. and i just signed a new lease. someone please tell me it gets better.

edit: thanks a million to everyone who replied with advice, messaged me to offer resume help and further tips, etc. i realized later that maybe i should have posted this in a career advice sub, but the response from everyone here has been so encouraging. even the tough love, which i know is needed. thank you so very much.

edit 2: yeah, i realize that some people don't think it's a good idea to honestly fill out an employee survey. i get it. but what's done is done, so telling me that i shouldn't ever do that isn't really helping here.

edit 3: it's late in the game at this point but just fyi - i knew that they would know it was me who filled out the survey. it was painfully obvious. i didn't care because i was so angry and fed up when i filled it out. i wanted it to start a conversation.",10
"girlfriend is trying to buy a car from carmax and they are being incredibly adamant about how bad it would be for her to get a co-signer and that she should definitely not get one, even though her credit isn't great.. my girlfriend's car finally bit the dust mechanically, and it would be about $1200 to get it fixed when it bluebooks for about $300. obviously time for a new car, and it wasn't a total surprise, just a little sooner than anticipated. anyway.

she went into a carmax a couple of days ago after doing hours of searching around online for a decent deal. its a 2018 mitsubishi mirage with i think 36k miles for like $9,999 or something in that ballpark. she knows her credit score/history isn't great, somewhere in the 650s, so she asked her father (who lives halfway across the country, as do i, so i haven't been with her in person for any of this) to co-sign for her, as carmax told her over the phone that he can co-sign and make a down payment by just being on the phone to verbally agree and go into his local carmax and sign papers and make the down payment. her father has objectively great credit and makes good money. 

so after we had a solid plan, she went into carmax to buy the car, and she said that the sales lady continually insisted that getting a co-signer for the car would be way more trouble than it's worth. saying things like ""are you sure you want to get a co-signer? you won't really save that much on apr and then you have to worry about them not wanting to give up half-ownership of the car later."" and ""i've seen it work out very badly for most people when they get a co-signer, i wouldn't recommend it."" repeat ad nauseum. 

so my gf, not being a very confrontational person, said okay after the sales lady assured her that even if they did the sale today without a co-signer, she has a 3 day (maybe longer?) grace period to return the car if she isn't happy and get a full refund, etc. so to make a long story short she got a roughly $12k loan with an almost 13% interest rate. i told her seems really not good, and she agreed, she didn't feel very good about the whole transaction.

so my question out of all of this is mainly: is this sales lady full of crap? i've never heard of a dealership advising against a co-signer. it usually goes the other way, where they tell you that they essentially can't get you a loan without a co-signer if you have bad credit. i can't tell if i just simply don't understand something about this situation or if something sketchy is going on. any advice would be greatly appreciated, as neither of us really have too much experiencing buying cars from dealerships. thanks in advance friends. feel free to ask any clarification questions, its a lot to type out and i'm sure i've missed something.

tl;dr: dealership is strongly advising against a co-signer for someone with relatively poor credit. something feels very not right about it.

edit: for clarification, its actually a 2017 with 47k miles. also, the 12k price included an extended 5 year warranty and gap insurance. just wanted to clear that up after she corrected me.",10
"update just got out of prison and owe so much money.... original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4jyy8r/just_got_out_of_prison_and_owe_so_much_money/)

it's been a year since i got out of prison and thought about updating for a few months but wanted everything to be absolutely settled before i did. i ended up moving to a more tech friendly city and the job search was still rough. i actually got a job offer 2 weeks after moving and was so excited to start. they asked about my background and i was totally honest with them. after some discussion, they still wanted to hire me but then a few days later i got a call saying hr wouldnt allow it. i was pretty beat up.  over the next few months i got a few interviews and even job offers but any time the background check came up i was denied. the only thing worse than not having a job is knowing you have the skills to get hired but something like this holds you back. im not going to lie and say it was easy. i broke down some nights but picked myself back up the next day and put out my application again. i worked at a restaurant to make some kind of money and it was rough. i was coming home with $10 sometimes and wondered if this was really going to be my life.

i continued to get calls from debt collectors but ignored them everytime. in the end of september i was having a particularly rough week making no money a work (serving tables) and had a job interview lined up. i didnt really have much hope for this job but figured screw it. later that day they told me i had the job but at that point it didnt even bring me excitement as i've heard that line before. i did the usual background check and waited for the fatal call. a call came that friday and was told i was to start on wednesday of next week. i was confused and in disbelief. everyday for a few weeks i expected someone to call me or pull me to the side work and tell me there's been a mistake. for the first three months i never even brung anything to put on my desk cause i figured it was any moment now. i worked there making more in one week sitting at a desk doing what i love to do than i was busting my butt for an entire month at a restaurant. 

finally, one day in janauary i was pulled to the side. the hiring manager asked me to see him in his office and he had a pretty serious look on his face. he sat me down and told me i've been doing very well these past couple of months. my supervisors are impressed  with how fast i've caught on and they decided to give me promotion. i was blown away. so here i was, 4 months into a job and i was offered a promotion with a great raise. 

i still work hard everyday there. i study up and learn more and try to improve myself with programming everyday. i look back at those few months where i was job searching and know that i made it as far as i did because even on days i was so depressed i didnt even want to get out of bed, i still got up and tried. what else could i do? i still worry about the future but for now, i want to work here for a while getting as much experience and time behind me so my criminal history will pale in comparison to my skills and drive to succeed. ive even managed to get a pretty good girlfriend who know all about my past and we've been dating for five months. she's supportive and is proud of how far i've gotten and how much i still do to make sure my past does not define me. i've helped a number of people start on their programming career and have even given presentations for new comers. have i gotten some back lash? yes, but screw those people.

as for my loans, i've saved up an emergency fund for 6 months and as of 2 weeks ago, i paid the last bit i owe on my credit card. i still have a mountain of student debt but i pay it off bit by bit. i dont get anymore calls about money i owe and well, life is alright. i hope anyone who is in a similar situation as me can look at this and know, someone in the same boat as you has made it through and succeeded.

"it's happened again: my hr rep fell victim to a phishing scam and sent all 50 employees' tax info to some fraudster yesterday. company has yet to notify everyone officially. what should i do?. as the title says, our hr rep sent all of our tax info in the form of w-2s to a scammer parading as our company president. i don't know why or how, but he didn't question it or call to confirm before sending.

regardless of how it happened, what can i and other employees do to protect ourselves? i'm miffed that the higher-ups haven't yet notified us directly. time is of the essence here. the standing it guy was saying ""they'll just sweep it under the rug."" he's the type where you can't quite tell if he's joking. i hope he was.

i already went ahead and changed my bank passwords and submitted a fraud alert to the credit bureaus. what kind of future am i looking at in terms of preventing future fraud, now that my info is floating around out there? am i going to have to maintain some kind of fraud alert or monitoring for life?

edit: my apologies folks! i was trying to go all meta with my title and refer to a similar post in the recent past which featured someone's hr falling for the same scheme. this is the first time that my hr rep has released info like this--that we know of.

**one more edit:** my supervisor just showed me this irs web page.(https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-alerts-payroll-and-hr-professionals-to-phishing-scheme-involving-w2s) the third quoted scam email was in the email to our hr rep, word for word: 

""i want you to...kindly prepare... to me asap.""

it's definitely not how the president writes his emails... pretty spooky.

**aaand another edit:** it's 2pm ct. no official word yet from the company higher-ups. as someone commented below, it's understandable that they have to get their ducks in a row (i think i said ""ducks in order"" before...i'm bad with colloquialisms) before approaching all of us. at the same time, it's bothering the hell out of me that we're still in the dark. i'm credit freezing as we speak. will update when i hear something!

**and another:** just wanted to follow up now that the work day is over. no word officially. i was called down to my manager's office for what i was hoping to be a discussion on the events detailed here, but it turned out to be a meeting to discuss a potential client that has historically been known by others to be difficult, unclear, and not really worth my time. basically, they sat down with me to warn me about a future job that wouldn't be a good fit. even though in the back of my mind, i was like, ""what are you people going to do about this breach that no one's mentioned yet?!,"" when it comes to my actual job and its duties, they were looking out for me.

now, i don't want this to sound like some sappy story in order to back up the fact that my company is a good company to work for, but i do believe that. so i won't be suing anyone but will be doing my best to protect myself with the tips in comments below.

i'll give it another day, but after that... !!!

**edit showing things have gotten all too real:** i was just be-bopping around my facebook tonight and saw that my coworker was getting pestered by facebook profiles with one friend/one pic. those are apparently a textbook sign of someone sitting behind the fake profile(s) trying to add people in order to obtain your full birthday. i'm pretty sure this coworker is somewhat aware of the ""mistakes"" that have been made by hr, but not the full extent, but i warned him to not add any of these fake people and why. i haven't been bombarded with requests, and i don't think i ever had the year listed to even my friends, but it's definitely hitting home what is happening to all of us. this will definitely be evidence of our collective identity theft. i suppose i should try to go to bed now... at least my doors are locked?

thank you all for the feedback!",10
"$5 dollars for 5 years: a savings experiment.. last month i cashed in on an experiment i started 5 years ago. i read about this idea to save a $5 dollar bill every time you had one on yourself. so i decided to give it a shot and start in august 2012. i never created change with a fiver on purpose nor went out of my way to exchange bills. i just set aside a bill when i came home from work or a night out, slowly adding to the pile and never withdrew. 

considering i seldom use cash i was curious to see how much would be saved over this period of time. it ended being a bit more than i expected with the final amount of $2285. not too shabby, might have to start this again sometime. anyways thought i might share this idea here, not sure if it belonged in r/frugal or not so i apologize in advance if it does. it's a neat little experiment to save money you don't miss.

"my girlfriend is being offered a too good to be true job with little to no personal history with employer.. hey guys!

so my girlfriend has answered a post in a private facebook group requesting if anyone would like to make money from home. the individual that posted the ad seems legit, long standing account many friends and posts and legitimate pictures. the individual says she requires someone for financial management, receiving payment from their business client, then making payout to customers for goods and services. the individual says they will train her in performing her tasks, and has requested my girlfriend to open a bank account with a specific bank. apparently the person sells fabric and textiles, when she received her resume the individual said that she can start tomorrow using her personal account, until the new bank card is received. i'm leery of the situation as she doesn't know this person personally and also wonder why the person wouldn't use an accountant/legitimate financial adviser for this. the person claims to work multiple jobs and does not have the time to perform the financial side of their dealings. we live in alberta, canada so i know this will narrow down the responses. wondering what precautions she should take concerning taxes. essentially my girlfriend will receive money from this individual and be required to pay out her vendors i do believe. is this going to become a big issue come tax times. what are the risks of her receiving large amounts of money and distributing from her personal bank account. could this be some sort of scam or a way to make her a potential scapegoat for illegal dealings as a sort of middle man. we're not crazy financial savvy and i wish i knew what kind of things any of you would look to give advise, i'll respond to comments as much as i can. plz help!p.s. the individual is requesting my girlfriend work 5 hours a day, 5 days a week for 50$/hr working out to $5000 a month without taxes. i do believe this individual will meet her soon in person and break down the whole situation, not sure if there will be paperwork or agreements involved.thanks a lot guys!

edit 1: after some of the comments, i'm wondering if she requests the individual open an account in their own name, giving her access could this protect her.

update 1: the individual specifically has asked for her to send all the answers to security questions, passwords and account info. obviously this is an absolute no go.

update 2: this person has now sent screen shots of their business account showing in excess of 12,000$ and has said that they require my girlfriend to operate from her own account to see how she manages it before giving her access to their business account.

update 3: sorry guys! i was away doing the dad thing, but i have been telling her from the start that it's crazy and that there's no way she should entertain it. your guy's overwhelming response has helped me sway her to see the light. you guys don't let me down thanks a lot but she will not be opening any new bank accounts in the near future :)",10
"done. 90k student loans killed in 5 years.. three things that led to this day. 

1) sacrifice and determination to pay down our loans. 

2) decent paying jobs where we didn't have to eat ramen, but we didn't buy many material things. 

3) we formulated our own method. you hear about the avalanche and snowball methods. we used both in a very calculated way. 

targeting our highest interest loans with the lowest balances. so if you have 3 loans at 6.8%, throw extra money on the 5k loan before the 10k loans to get satisfaction of paying off a loan and saving the most on interest.

"i'm 32 and broke. i finally made my first budget ever and i'm -$700 in the hole every month. what do i do?. so, i've never had a lot of money, but i lost my full time job this past april and i'm now working part time at a bank while also attending college during the day, 3 days per week.  i make about $250 per week.  my grandma gives me $400 per month to help with my rent.  i know, i'm pathetic.

i've been having to borrow a lot of money from my parents, and it's been pretty shitty, so i broke down and finally added up all my expenses and income, and i make about $700 less than i need to just to break even.  i check on indeed pretty much every day to see if i can get a second job, but the job market in my area is really bad, and i'm also kind of limited by my school schedule as to which hours i can work.  dropping out is not an option - i'm a semester and a half away from my bachelor's.

my rent is $600 and i am probably moving soon, in with my brother, which should cut that almost in half.  i did notice that i spend a lot of money on food - like $400 per month.  i don't eat out very often but i do cook a lot and i literally never check prices when i'm grocery shopping, i just get what i need for the recipe. so that's an area of opportunity.

but even if i cut both my rent and my grocery shopping in half, i'd still be in the hole.  i have about 4 credit cards all with low limits (the highest is $650) but they're all maxed out and i pay about $130 monthly for them, just minimum payments. my credit sucks.  i would get a debt consolidation loan for them (they all have high rates, like 24%) but i almost certainly will not be approved for any kind of loan based on my dti and my credit score.

"chase bank may be experiencing a substantial hack or system failure. edit 1: as comments have pointed out below, logging in might make you more vulnerable to the issue depending on the cause. one alternative may be to call their automated system to determine the latest transactions on the account and if any unauthorized transfers have occurred. 

edit 2: changed some language in the post below to be more consistent with the point in edit 1. from comments, it sounds like chase believes the issue may be limited in the number of people affected, which i hope is the case. but i am also doubtful of how the issue is being portrayed as the bloomberg article states that chase said it ""doesn't know of any unauthorized transactions,"" which is definitely not accounting for the unauthorized transaction that occurred on my account at the exact same time as the login issue (they confirmed by phone that the timestamp of the transaction was during when i had the login issue). i would also like to know more information from chase regarding how it determined the issue was resolved as it stated to bloomberg.  i hope they are not assuming that the issue is limited to just those who notice and report the issue and instead undertake a full investigation, as reported instances would likely be a subset of the people actually affected. regardless of how widespread the issue (i.e. the number of accounts affected) it seemed the potential consequences to an individual could be severe, as it appeared to provide full access to another person's account, which could be how the funds were transferred from my account as well. as noted in comments, there are fraud protections so hopefully that will mitigate this (i am definitely relying on those protections to have my own funds restored).

original post:
i wanted to provide this warning if you bank with chase about an issue that happened to me on a recent log in to their online system. on wednesday afternoon/evening, i logged into the online banking system using my own account information and the chase system instead logged me into an entirely different person's account, a person i have no knowledge of. when i logged out of the account, and logged in again using the same account info, i was then able to access my own account, only to find out an unauthorized transfer had occurred in the last 20 minutes. if it had only been an unauthorized transfer from my account, i would have assumed that my account information had been hacked or stolen. but that would not explain why chase's system directed me to another person's account (granting access to their transactions, username, personal information etc) when i attempted to log into my own account using my account information. within the past day, i have heard of another person having what sounds like a potentially similar issue. when i called chase to resolve this issue, i found out that there was an internal memo about this issue and they were experiencing abnormally high call traffic which i would guess to be related. this is just a warning and heads up in case it could be affecting you as well.",10

"entry level position. just discovered my peers make 25% more than me despite similar experience level. was lied to by a vp.. so i started my first real job last summer, got an offer for a bit lower than i expected for the job and the city i would be working in (biotech start up) and when i tried to negotiate for more (because i knew i could be making just as much in a much cheaper city) i got a call from the vp of r&d who told me that he thought the offer was competitive. additionally i was told by him that all entry level employees make the same but that evaluations would happen soon after my employment and that based on the quality of my work and based on my work ethic there was room for growth and improvement of pay. i was very interested in the work and decided it would be a very cool experience that could build up my experience in biotech and industry. 

evaluations happened a month and a half ago with no foreseeable follow up and then 2 weeks ago they fired that vp for unrelated reasons (as far as i can tell). that being said, last week i found out all my peers make more than me, one of which makes 25% more than me despite only starting a few weeks before me (though they did intern with the company previously). the others started exactly when i did. and i know i have more experience in this field overall than all of them just based on cv's and that all of my experience is directly applicable to the current project (including a year of experience doing the same type of work but in academia). 

so i was blatantly lied to. and i am pissed. 

advice on how to negotiate to fix this would be greatly appreciated. thank you in advance.

"update to ""gym sold my bank account to another gym, $500 charge"". tl;dr 2 weeks ago a health club i didn't know charged me 500 dollars. it took two weeks to get the money back. always ask for the fastest option...

two weeks ago, i posted this thread asking for advice(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dcb19e/gym_sold_my_bank_account_to_another_gym_500_charge/). i had woken up to a 500 dollar ach withdrawal from my checking account by a health club i didn't know. 

after some digging i found out that my old gym (og) went under and sent their members to this health club (hc). the problem was, i didn't know my og went under. i maintained a 10 dollar a month membership in case i wanted to start back up, i had also moved across town which is why i wasn't going. 

i was concerned that contacting the hc could damage my chances for a fraud case.  the first thing i did was call my bank to dispute the transaction. some people that responded here convinced me to contact the hc. the manager was very apologetic, seemed to think it was a snafu with transferring accounts from og to hc. the system thought i was delinquent and charged me a bunch of late fees, which is why it was 5 times what i would normally pay in a year.

the manager told me it's usually easier to process a refund if there isn't a dispute in the original charges. he said that a refund should only take a few days. he also said kind of off hand that he could probably get me a check if i needed the money back quicker. ding, ding, ding! that's the option i *should* have taken. i didn't fully understand how long a refund can take. a few days ago i called the billing company for hc, their refunds can take 5-7 business days, which is almost 2 weeks in real people time.

i ended up visiting hc several times, talking to the manager in person, calling, texting. i was at the ""just cut me a check"" point when the funds left their account and i had to wait for them to show up in mine.  several days later i started getting refunds and this morning i got the final one (there were three separate charges).

next time, i'll take the check.",10
"am i better off being poor?. hey guys, so i currently make $38,000, working full time, 26 years old, in california. my main problem is that i'm paying $820 a month for my health insurance. i have the absolute cheapest plan, with a  $7500 deductible. unfortunately, i don't qualify for any subsidies because i'm apparently super rich and way over the poverty line. 

out of the 38,000, i take home roughly 30k a year. out of that 30k, i lose 10k because of the $820 monthly payments. so i'm essentially only making ~$20k.

my question is this. am i better off getting a part time job? that way i can make around $21-22k a year, qualify for medical for dental, subsidies, food stamps, etc. so i'll basically be better off, while working less hours.

is my train of thought flawed? i can't even tell anymore. i've been having a really rough two years both for my mental health and physically, and i literally can't even afford the copay to see a doctor ($75 per office visit). i feel like i'm working just to survive so i can keep working. i don't want to live like this anymore


edit: sorry, i just got off work. so yeah i probably fucked up the paperwork. i live with my grandpa and put him as the head of household and his age on the application (age of head of household). i redid the calculator and now i'm seeing plans for $260 for bronze.

"warning - bank of america charges a $144 a year maintenance fee for the basic checking account. since i discovered a $12 monthly charge a while back when my account was automatically switched from a student account after i graduated and moved, i've been passing the warning along to those who might be unaware every year around graduation. also a $5 maintenance fee on savings accounts.

if you are job hunting and don't have much money or have dipped into your emergency funds you certainly are getting charged(https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5a68a762e4b0dc592a0e91d6) without realizing it, or will be soon. this was in the ~~fine~~ print when you signed up for your free account, but most people don't tend to remember things that they agreed to as teens when going through crucial life changes like graduation or loss of a job. so i hope posting this again helps people like it did last time.

a customer representative said there's nothing that can be done, so i recommend changing banks perhaps to a credit union if this may be a problem for you.

edit: td bank also does this as per another user.

edit 2: people are really salty that i've shared this information. if you are not job hunting, in really good financial shape, and already knew this then great, but this post isn't targeted at you. and yes, there *are* banks and credit unions that don't require this kind of fee to provide service. if you personally feel boa is the best for your particular financial situation, that's totally okay too.

edit 3: guys chill, i signed up for the account when i was 16. yes yes, it's my mistake for not remembering. the point of this post is to help people avoid this mistake and to be aware that there are banks that don't do this. last year i helped remind some people, and this year i hope to help some more people too. :)

edit 4: online banking and credit unions have been recommended (which i personally use), and if you absolutely need brick and mortar large chains for some reason usaa and
capital one bank have free accounts.

edit 5: if you go to close your boa account, be sure to withdraw or transfer all your money *before* you tell them you want to close your account. they often will try to charge you $10 for the cashier's check to get your money back when you close your account. if you are overseas you're out of luck, there is virtually no way to close your account from overseas and you'll continue to be charged, so remember this before moving abroad or moving back to a country with no boa.",10
"today i was 100% certain i was getting laid off, however they gave me the option to transfer to williston nd. if i dont accept, i will be terminated monday. i'm struggling to figure out what might be right for my family.. my wife and i (no kids) live in houston tx. i am in oil and gas. she is a successful family law attorney. here is our info:  

me: 33yrs - oil and gas - safety professional - $130k.  

 i think it's important to note that this us a relatively high salary for my position, and i would be very hard pressed to find anything close to this.

her: 27yrs - family law attorney - $75k.  

she got lucky finding the firm she is with and she loves it.  





i've worked with the same company for the last 14 years, however things have not been good lately. after numerous rounds of lay offs, they finally got around to me. however they offered me a transfer instead. if i accept, they expect for me to be moved by mid december. if i dont accept, they will lay me off on monday and give me a severance of 6 weeks.  



my biggest concern in this decision is my wife. she has an amazing stable job which she loves and i really dont think she will adjust well to north dakota. she loves the sun, the pool, the city, etc.  and, her job is very stable compared to mine. even though i make more money, my company is not doing well. there is a chance that i get moved up to nd and get laid off in 3 months (i dont think i'm exaggerating; however things could improve). the last thing i would want is for us to move, turn her world upside down, give up her stable job, just for me to get laid off in nd.  

as i think on the financial aspect of it, and the risk involved, i believe the best decision would be to take the job in nd. at least in the short term. if i allow myself to get laid off on monday, i could get another job in 1 week or 6 months (it's an unknown). and there is no telling where the salary would be (it's an unknown). to me it's similar to the old saying, ""one in the hand is worth two in the bush"".  and right now, the job in nd is my one on the hand.

if i get three more months with the company, that's worth more than 6 weeks of severance. also, i dont think it's a smart move to willingly be laid off, without a similarly paying job lined up.  

this leads me to my question, what's the best financial and caring thing to do for our family? no decision is easy here. i would appreciate any thoughts you all might have.   

 its probably important for me to note that she is the type of person who will put a smile on her face and say ""let's go."" she wants to support me. but she has never been to nd. she has never been in weather colder than ~20 degrees.  

the best plan i've come up with is:  

i go to north dakota, while my wife stays in houston; at least for 2 or 3 months. during that time i can search for and apply for jobs in houston. during that time if i get laid off, she still has her job and i can come back. during that time maybe things become more stable and she finds a good job posted in williston? it's all about trying to buy more time to see which way the wind blows. more time = better decision. the cost is our time together; and i see it as a great cost. it pains me to think of not being together that long.  


i dont know. but this seems like the most responsible choice, both financially and out of respect for my wife. it breaks my heart to have to think about moving her away from friends and a city and job she loves, all so i can keep my job which is located in a horrible place (subjective) and which is (at this time) an unstable career.

edit: my wife and i have saved up ~6 months worth of expenses. i also believe we could get by on her salary, along with the unemployment without even needing to dip into the emergency fund. that obviously comes at the cost of not contributing to a 401k or her ira, and other cut backs. but we could do it.  

edit 2: i think we have decided that its best to not disrupt her job. she is stable. she has a great career. ultimately my job will change. but ultimately we think we need to keep my wife at her current firm in houston.  

so ultimately, this means the end goal is to get back to houston, or a nearby city that she has built up networks.  

if that's the goal, then do i move for three months in while looking for a job? or do i just stay in houston, take the lay off, and look for a job?  


we have about 50k in our emergency fund.  

my severance would be about 9k. unemployment in texas lasts for about 4 months, at about $500 per week.

after everything is said and done, i think we could survive for ~5 months just off of the unemployment and severance, without having to dip into the emergency fund.  

so i guess the ultimate question is, do i go to williston for 3 months with the intent to look for a job back in houston? or do i take the lay off, collect unemployment and hope to find a job in 5months (before using emergency fund)?  

edit 3:  

this has been a very emotional 24hrs. one thing is certain, things are going to change. and change can be scary.  

but with everyone's help, i honestly feel like the best decision is to stay in houston. take the severance. apply for unemployment. if i play it right, i could go ~6 months without even dipping into my emergency fund.  

and by staying in houston, i can stay with my wife. i can attend in person interviews. i can dedicate my self full time to finding another job.  

i dont know if that's the best choice. and i have read great points of view. and i thank everyone so so much.  

this reddit post has taken me from scared and worried, to hopeful.  


edit 4: 

my biggest career positive (on paper) is my experience. though my lack of a degree has me worried. been working towards me ba in occupational safety, while working. this extra time might also help me push closer to that. i'm not sure if ""working towards a degree"" carries any weight in an interview or not. we will see.  

besides that i have the standard osha 10 & 30, as well as a petroleum safety specialist and petroleum safety manager certification.

edit 5:

tonight really helped us get our heads together. she seems okay and she can tell i'm less stressed, which is what she worries about. 

i reached out to my hr lady and she confirmed that if i dont take the transfer, which will result in me being laid off,  i'll have medical until end of month. they will supply me with a ""laid off letter"" which states i was not fired but  laid off. i have a week of vacation to cash in. ill get one lump sum of 6 weeks. and  im eligible for unemployment (knew that).

tomorrow i will start updating my resume and updating out budget to keep us on track. i will reach out to some recruiters and apply if i see something which catches my eye. thursday, i'll do it all again.

this whole ordeal has made me reassess my situation. and my eyes have opened up to the importance of cherishing the simple things. we sat on the coach together kind of crying a little off and on, while watching disney+. that's the kind of life i want. that's the kind of life i have. moving away would jeopardize that. and i dont know if i would have realized that if it wasnt for you all.",10
"stocks got pummeled last night and futures point to lower opening. don't you dare do a thing about it.. nasdaq had its worst day in over two years, s&p was down over 3%. i've personally never lost so much net worth in a day as i did yesterday. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/us-markets-focus-on-wall-street-rout-as-it-batters-global-markets.html

futures point to another big loss today. this could all be a blip and we're back to a new record next month. or it could be the start of a multi-year bear market. we might lose 20 or 50% over the next few years. i have no idea what will happen.

if you were too heavily exposed to stocks yesterday morning before this happened, it's too late now. *don't panic*. hold on tight :) the people who made a killing over the last decade did not panic sell when the market started to self-destruct a decade back, and instead spent years buying up more equities.",10
"i almost fell for an irs scam yesterday. i got a call from a washington, d.c. number yesterday with an automated message telling me it was the ""criminal investigation division"" of the irs, and to call them back immediately.

i did. got on the phone with an indian sounding man who told me his name was matt smith, or some generic sounding american name. he told me there was a warrant out for my arrest because i fraudulently claimed some tax exemptions over the past three years.

i wasn't thinking straight because i'm in the process of buying a house, and my credit is really important. it sounded convincing until he asked me to pay. 

he said there were two ways it could be handled, either ""privately or publicly."" i could either pay the debt now and it wouldn't be reported to any credit agencies, or i could do it publicly, in which case the debt would be reported to the police and local news outlets.

he told me all my assets had been frozen and my bank accounts were ""black listed."" it didn't seem like a term an irs agent would use, but whatever. then he told me since my accounts were frozen, the only way i could pay the debt was with gift cards from the grocery store, and that i needed to stay on the line with him the entire time until i got the cards. wtf? how am i going to buy gift cards if my bank account has been frozen? do you think i just have $3,000 in cash on me right now?

that's when it clicked. this is bullshit. i lived in dc for a few years and i know the area. i started asking him how he gets to work, what neighborhood he lives in, what metro stop he gets off at, etc. 

he just hung up on me and when i tried to call back it just kept coming up as a busy signal.

i'm laughing about it now, but i was shitting bricks on the phone yesterday. i'm an educated, moderately intelligent person, and he had me going. they probably trick elderly people with this scam all the time.


edit: to everyone making fun of me: i've been going through a lot of shit lately and i'm in the process of purchasing a house. so i'm really sensitive to anything that could screw that up. i didn't fall for it. this whole phone call lasted about five minutes. there was no chance i was going to buy this guy gift cards.

"i ""won"" in a drawing at a festival, but i suspect it was a scam. i want to know your thoughts.. i went to a festival about a month and a half ago and the check-in process was lengthy—i was told i'd be entered into a drawing but i didn't give it much thought.

a few weeks ago i started to get calls from a number i didn't recognize—when i googled it, it came back as a travel agency and there were several reports marking as spam. i decided not to answer the calls, but they've been coming in more often (increasing from once a day to 3 times a day). yesterday i decided to answer and was told i had won the drawing and was given the option for several prizes—a $250 gift card, a 40"" tv, beats headphones among several other things—cool, i opted for the gift card. also, i won a 2 night stay at one of two resorts. one was a resort about 45 minutes away from me, the second was a ski resort in the mountains. i went with the second option as i thought it would be fun for the family. the guy said ""let me confirm the mailing address"" and i asked him what dates i was allowed to book—then he put me on hold to get a ""supervisor"".

supervisor explains that he was new and she wanted to make sure he informed me correctly of what i had won and used the right terminology. ok, ""so, he told you about the deposit?"" wait. what. i'm not comfortable with giving my payment information over the phone. i'm not even sure if this is real. and then she got super pushy. ""it's a $75 deposit and you get it back after the tour plus i'll give you an extra night and you'll get your $75 back and the $250 gift card."" tour? my mind immediately went to timeshare. without voicing my concerns, she said ""this is not a timeshare pitch, it's literally a tour of the grounds so you'll come back"". 

i'll have to think about it. 

""ok, you're on the phone with a supervisor, i'm offering you an extra night—$250 gift card and the only thing you have to pay is $75 (which you get back)—why are you saying no?"" 

red flags all around, so i told her i was at work and couldn't talk. 

""well, we've been on the phone for 8 minutes already—""

and then i just hang up.

has this happened to anyone else? was this a scam? it seemed really fishy and questionable.

*edit: based on everyone's feedback, it sounds like it's not a scam in the traditional sense. since i'm in b2b sales and confident in my ability to say no (also, i'm cheap) i may take them up on it if they call back (or i may just fund my own vacation to a ski resort). thanks for the heads up, everyone!",10

"job offer rescinded after submitting counteroffer. just want to post and remind people here of the reality of negotiations going bad for you. most posts here about starting new jobs recommend that you always negotiate your starting wage as most employers expect you to. while i would still recommend this too, i will say make sure you are negotiating from a position of strength. luckily for me, i'm still employed with a job i like and could afford  taking on the risk of losing an offer. but for people who are unemployed or underemployed, i would think twice before possibly losing a job offer. know your worth. 

little backstory on the job offer:

i currently work as an application engineer for a company that i genuinely enjoy. my pay is fair, it's an esop, i never have to work over 40 hours (usually only do 37.5) and the first $2,500 of medical expenses per year (out of $6,000 total deductible) is paid for by the company, which makes going to the doctor a lot easier knowing i won't have a bill. we also receive bonuses based on company bookings. these bonuses give me an additional $12-14k a year. safe to say, i know how good i have it and was not actively looking to change things up. 

a couple weeks ago, a ceo of a small company reached out to me on linkedin and presented an interesting opportunity. he had just purchased this small company (<5 people) in the area i was working. basically this was a family run company and the guy he bought it from was looking to retire. he was going to stay on for additional 1-2 years to help train me be a suitable replacement for him. i liked everything about the opportunity and would have taken it if the compensation lined up. after the interview, i received an offer in my email. the base pay was about 13% higher than my current pay and this job also had bonuses, but i had no idea how easy they would be obtained compared to my current situation. he offered less pto then i was currently receiving and i already knew i could kiss goodbye to my great work/life balance that i currently had, since he wanted to grow the company by 50% in the first year. the guy who was on the way out was already doing 60-70 hour weeks. i counter offered stating that i expected the work load to increase from my current position and that i genuinely don't want to leave so i asked him to raise the base salary by $10k (a 15% increase from the initial offer) and that i would accept if he could meet that. 

he wrote back the following:

""at that rate we will be pursuing a more experienced engineer with less demands at such an inexperienced level. ""

in my mind that's a very unprofessional response so i already know i dodged a bullet. 

but anyway just be careful when negotiating, but if you have a job that you like, play hardball all you want.

edit: slight confusion for some posters in this thread. this company isn't a start up it's been owned by the same guy for over 30 years. he just never expanded it. new ceo just bought it a week ago since the former owner wants to retire but not leave his customers sol. i would essentially being taking this guys place while he trains me for a year or two.

edit 2: /u/semisolidwhale summarizes it better than i can for anyone confused by the situation

""
a) if i understand correctly, legacy had nothing to do with it. the guy doing the interviewing/offer wasnt the original owner who was sunsetting out of the ceo position, it was the ceo of the company buying them out.

b) op states that the retiring head of the company was already putting in 60-70 hrs a week and that the goal of the new owner was to grow the business by 50% in the first year. doubtful that the company was on a trajectory to glide into that kind of growth already. hence op, being new to the organization and tasked with a massive growth goal should expect to easily exceed the 60-70 he average of the previous owner and fewer pto days.

c) op is currently an application engineer. this position sounds like a lot more responsibility. that can be a great opportunity in the right circumstances, but you can't pay your bills with opportunities to prove yourself and employers should compensate employees accordingly.

d) op states ""i asked him to raise the base salary by $10k (a 15% increase from the initial offer)."" this suggests the original offer was probably somewhere around 65k. call me crazy, but asking 75k for a 60+ hour work well and being takes with leading the growth of a small company by 50% in the next year does not seem like an outlandish ask by any means.
op had every right to expect a decent pay increase given the increased demands of the position. it seems likely the new owner has expectations that exceed their willingness to compensate accordingly. there's a reason it's called the labor market.""",10

"three companies, including my bank, don't know where my money went. they're all redirecting me to each other.. **background:** several weeks ago i accidentally purchased a $100 starbucks e-gift card through the chase.com website on my computer browser. i wanted to send my sibling a belated gift of direct money. within 2-5 minutes of sending the money and realizing my mistake, i called chase and starbucks to cancel the transaction. chase said they could not cancel it because the transaction was already completed and $100 had been debited from my checking account. a representative from starbucks redirected me to cashstar (the third-party company in charge of e-gifts). the cashstar representative cancelled the transaction. 

i was supposed to refunded my $100 a month ago, but i have not seen my money yet. this is the summary of what has happened.

**chase:**

* their transaction history confirms that the money was debited from my account and sent out. 
* they have not received any confirmation of any refunds or money returned, so as far as they are concerned, the money was released and cannot refund the money.
* i spoke to a branch associate who sat down with me for about 2 hours on the phone with cashstar and starbucks who both confirm that they never received the money because they cancelled the transaction/e-gift card -- ""chase must be responsible.""
* chase internal investigation and claims division ""investigated"" the matter and deemed they cannot refund me the money. the money was sent out and that's the only record they have. but they never contacted anyone outside of chase - and they refuse to.
* chase directs me to starbucks/cashstar because they ""must have received"" the money.

**starbucks:**

* the transaction happened online through chase's platform so contact them.
* the transaction was for an e-gift card so contact cashstar, because they handle online/e-gift card transactions.
* starbucks records show that the card was cancelled and never processed.
* starbucks has no record of money coming in.

**cashstar:**

* transaction and card number only yield an empty and unactivated card. 
* cashstar cannot see if money came in, only that it was cancelled.
* cashstar claims that they do not see or handle any of the money directly -- i should contact either chase or starbucks.
* cashstar redirects me to chase regarding the refund because the money originally came out of my chase bank account.

**me and my sibling:**

* my sibling and i received the regular e-gift card email with the code to open it, but it never opened and yields only a 404 page. the card doesn't exist.
* i am still missing $100 from my account.
* my sibling never received the $100.


i am at a loss as to where my $100 is. i keep getting redirected around and around and i have spent over 10 hours on the phone and at the chase branch talking to people trying to get my $100 back.

**my bank claims the money was sent out, the other companies say the money was never received.**

**here is a visual summary of my experience.(https://imgur.com/asishfs)**

i am sorry to hear about the others who have experienced similarly unresolved issues. i hope we can find a solution to all this.

more than two weeks ago, i sat down with a chase bank representative and we tried our best to do a conference call of chase, cashstar, and starbucks. at one point, we had a starbucks rep and a cashstar supervisor on one line, and the chase bank representative was on the line with the claims and quick-pay dept of chase. nothing was resolved.",10
"i had cancer at 22, now i have 7 debt collectors threatening me for money, while i'm still trying to finish college.. ok, here we go. i'm a full time college student. i took out loans for all of it. i'm $30k in debt studying land surveying. it's a really physical job so i can't get an internship until i'm healthy again. i'm 2 years from graduating. 

this last summer, i was diagnosed with non hodgkin lymphoma. luckily, 3 months before i got diagnosed i got a form a obamacare. so my insurance covered like 95% of the hospital bills. i went to 3 different hospitals for treatment and was seen by atleast 30 doctors over the last 4 months. each doctor billing me/my insurance company.

i had to leave my apartment complex and move out without 60 day notice and my cats ruined my carpet so my apartment complex billed me $1200 and sent me to a debt collector. 

my brother was nice enough to let me live with him debt free for a while to get back on my feet but there is no end in sight. 

 i just finished my last round of chemo, so now it's time to worry about the bills. well, each bill, was sent to a debt collector because i didn't pay any of them while i was getting treatment. it was obviously the last thing on my mind. well, since i've been in school for four years, federal aid told me they're going to start charging me monthly because i've reached my borrowing limit.

 so in total, my credit is ruined, i might not be able to finish school and get a job, i'm barley able to work part time as it is right now, and i'm bringing in no more than $500 a month. my car insurance, car payment, school repayment, credit card payments (isn't much), debt collectors, and left over hospital bills, i just don't know what to do. my family has no money as it is so they can't help and i've applied to atleast 10 different financial aid assistant programs through the hospitals but it just isn't helping. 

i added up all my credit card and debt collector debt and it's $4500. my hospital debt is $10k and counting. my school loans are $30k and i still owe $5k on my car. i'm just so afraid i'm going to lose everything and it's not even my fault.

personally, as a broke university student, eating out on campus once every two weeks is such a treat that i look forward to. too often i see fellow students overindulging in things like fake nails and eyelashes (or male equivalent buying overpriced clothing/food/beer); treating themselves when they didn't budget for it and end up short on money.

now, i've heard of scams with a similar premise before, and i think they're probably not out to scam me, but considering they accidentally sent over 100k to the wrong guy, i don't wanna get fucked somehow by their incompetence if not malice. i've already spoken with my bank through the phone and in person and they've given me different answers. the person over the phone suggested the safest way for me to give the money back is to tell them my bank can't do anything and see if they could speak with their bank and somehow get the transaction reversed on their end, whereas the branches i've visited in person said the sender can't reverse it on their end, so i have to send it back myself, with the sort of attitude basically telling me to ""get fucked kid we're not liable if anything happens"". i think i'm done with td after i get this sorted out.


so logically speaking, you'd think banks would be able to reverse international wires for exactly these sort of mistakes right? they can reverse it, right? so for now, i've told them to check with their bank first and see if they could get the transaction reversed. what's my next step if they say they can't? how do i protect myself for the worst case scenario? in what ways can they fuck me if they tried to?


edit: the account they sent it from is the same account they're asking me to send it back to, so there's nothing strange going on there, at least.",10

"i recently met a new mom friend who mentioned that she and her husband are being mentored by a couple who were able to retire in their 30s.. this new friend mentioned that she would like to ""pay it forward"" by inviting my husband and i into this ""great opportunity"".
my question is, has anyone heard about this? 

she has been extremely vague about the whole situation. she did briefly mentioned that what they do is similar to an mlm but they aren't a mlm. red flag. i know. she also was very adamant that she and her husband would have to meet with us several times to get to know us and to make sure we would be a good time investment for them and the ""power couple."" she kept saying that they are slowing achieving that lifestyle of having a  cashflow and not having to worry about money and how they are able to spend more time with their kids and travel and most importantly sharing this great opportunity.  

i really with i could tell you guys more but that's all i know. my husband is skeptical from the get go and i don't blame him. he is currently out only source of income while i'm a stay at home mom and currently 4 months pregnant.  my main concern is finding what this woman is trying to get us into and if its something bad money wise i would like to know more about it in case i run into someone like her again.

update:

i texted her this morning telling her that my husband and i were not interested and that our retirement plans are fine and doing well on their own and we do not need anymore investments or want anything she was offering. i asked her not to message me anymore. she hasn't even replied about her book lol so into the donation bin it goes. i did read it and the book alone is a good read but i don't have any use for it. 

i just want to say thank you for all the advice and for helping me uncover her scam. i hate being preyed upon but i will never jeopardize my family's financial well being especially not while were under one income. 

i'm still reading all of the comments coming in and looking up all the financial advice you guys are mentioning. once again, thank you for helping me out.",10
"i'm reading a lot on here that using a credit card for every purchase over $20 and then just paying it off either at the end of every day or week is better than just using debit. is this actually good practice?. right now i just use my debit card from wells fargo to purchase everything. i do have a credit card that i rarely use. should i switch to the mentioned method to build credit? or maybe find another cc that racks up flyer miles? really confused on this and that if it actually benefits my credit score

does it cost to use cc for bills? has happened to me several times (like 2-3% charge) instead of using debt

where to keep savings? stay with wells fargo?

"when asked for salary expectations do not give a number. i've seen this time and time again on this sub and with my friends irl. 

my friend recently interviewed at a job and they asked ""what are your salary expectations?"" to which he replied ""i'm looking in the realm of $50-$60k"". guess what they offered him?

ding. you guessed it. 50k. 

when asked this question in an interview, do not give a number instead reply with something along the lines of...

interviewer: ""now, what would you say your salary expectations are?""
you: ""i would just expect to be paid fairly for the experience and skills that i bring to the table"" 

if they press further - tell them ""i would be remiss to give a number because there are many aspects that go into overall compensation and i would need to be able to compare all aspects of it.""

this is a completely true statement as bonus, stock, health insurance, 401k, hsa, pto and education reimbursement are all elements of a potential compensation plan.


edit: i realize that there isn't a one size fits all approach to this. if you know exactly what you are worth and have confidence in that number, all the power to you to give an accurate and informed number to hr. it is in your best interest to try to negotiate up as much as you can, and many hr reps will try to get good talent for low cost to the company. it definitely is a negotiation. i would argue that the majority of people do not know exactly what their range is, and yes research is key here, but doesn't always lead to the employee being confident in a number they should be getting paid. i think many people do do themselves a disservice by undervaluing their talent and come in low. that could be due to lack of research, lack of confidence, lack of negotiation skills etc. one way to combat this for people that are newer to interviewing and don't have a good sense of were they fall on that spectrum, is to try to abstain from giving a number. that's all my point was about.

edit 2: i regret making this as an ultimatum. went for effect and definitely got it. this doesn't apply to everyone. there are situations that giving a number is advisable. also getting a lot of comments on online applications, and from hr or hiring managers railing against this idea. i appreciate all of the responses, difference in opinion, even the rude ones. good to gain perspective on my part.",10
"remember to regularly audit your subscription services! you may be letting anywhere from $5 to $20 slip out of your wallet each month. this video about the hidden costs of monthly subscription services(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ndzao7hsnk) by the wall street journal just popped up on my youtube recommended videos list. 

ironically, the top comment is from someone joking about how they need to cancel their digital subscription to the wsj(https://i.imgur.com/gbv7qwg.png)!

this video prompted me to do a self-audit, generating a master list of all my monthly subscriptions and annual fees (excluding things like my electric bill, internet, cell phone, etc.). seems like a good exercise for most people to try. 
____________________

**monthly subscriptions:**

1. **cocofloss**, $7/month for two packs - premium floss that has motivated me to floss every day
2. **spotify family**, $15/month - shared with my siblings/spouses-in-law, so the net cost to my immediate family is $6
3. **new york times**, $4/month  - i recently got a 6 month promo rate for digital access, but honestly i rarely have time read the news....i might end up canceling this!
4. **netflix**, $0/month for now.....using my friend's account for free! i dogsit for him occasionally, so it's a good barter system. even before the rate hike, i was tired of paying each month for this.
5. **ring doorbell 2**, $0/month because i refuse to pay for storage when companies like wyzecam (which we use as a travel baby monitor) offer cloud video storage for free
6. **google drive**, $1.99/month for 100gb of additional storage (my s/o works in design and needs a reliable cloud backup service. we all have pixels, so this is pretty seamless integration)
___________________

**annual fees:**

1. **hyatt credit card**, $79/year - gets us one free night in a category 1-4 hyatt property each year....this is our third year with this card and it easily pays for itself
2. **costco membership**, $55/year - honestly we might cancel this one -- we can get almost everything from target/amazon, and we don't eat that much lol) 
3. **amazon prime**, $119/year - split between my family. my dad is the primary account holder, and we only pay $30/year
4. **aaa**, $100/year - mostly a peace of mind thing at this point. i've needed towing once in the last few years. i don't know if my spouse has ever utilized their services. maybe i could use more of their discounts on other services -- i heard they do museums?

"i have not eaten out at lunch while at work now for a full 8 days. honestly it's a record. this is obviously not a huge deal for many people in this sub.  i used to be much better about budgeting...life happened and i fell off the rails.  i've realized i have spent roughly $250-300 / month just on personal eating eating out as i made it a habit to grab some food after hitting the gym during my lunch hour.  unless work provided food, i was never bringing food to the office. 

with trying to be better about saving in general, and realizing i haven't contributing anything to my 401k or roth in 18 months...a change needs to happen.  

i know i won't go 5 days / week of never eating out..but i needed to make a change and it doesn't benefit me health/fitness wise particularly but i will figure out a better routine.  i went to the store and bought some healthy pb, organic jelly, and some healthy bread  and decided to just make a sandwich at my desk every day for lunch. my work has various snacks so i will pick at those. i bought a handful of the 90 second uncle ben rice packets as well.  i can take 2 scoops of protein powder with me each day as well.  

i'm not good at prepping my food late at night or in the morning..part of that is bad time management, laziness, and forgetfulness. so making the sandwich with the ingredients in my drawer is sometimes easiest.

"irs: refunds worth $1.1b waiting to be claimed by those who have not filed 2014 federal income tax returns!. **don't let the government hold onto your money!**

washington ― unclaimed federal income tax refunds totaling about $1.1 billion may be waiting for an estimated 1 million taxpayers who did not file a 2014 federal income tax return, according to the internal revenue service.

to collect the money, these taxpayers must file their 2014 tax return with the irs no later than this year's tax deadline, tuesday, april 17.

""we're trying to connect a million people with their share of $1.1 billion in unclaimed refunds for 2014,"" said acting irs commissioner david kautter. ""time is running out for people who haven't filed tax returns to claim their refunds. students, part-time workers and many others may have overlooked filing for 2014. **and there's no penalty for filing a late return if you're due a refund.""**

the irs estimates the midpoint for the potential refunds for 2014 to be $847; half of the refunds are more than $847 and half are less.

in cases where a federal income tax return was not filed, the law provides most taxpayers with a three-year window of opportunity for claiming a tax refund. if they do not file a tax return within three years, the money becomes the property of the u.s. treasury. for 2014 tax returns, the window closes april 17, 2018. the law requires taxpayers to properly address, mail and ensure the tax return is postmarked by that date.""

here are some resources for some faqs -

1. if you don't know if you need to file, take this online questionnaire(https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return) to help you decide. see also, filing for taxpayers living abroad.(https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayers-living-abroad)

"start thinking of ""saving money"" as ""making money"" instead.. i'm no expert, but this simple change in thought has saved me more money over the past year than ever before.

i was constantly thinking of ways to make more money in life, and would do anything it took to create multiple incomes.

i was saving, but not really actively focused on it.

i would just save what i planned to, and spend my budget as freely as possible.

i then had a thought that if i actively tried to save and make better decisions under my budget, it would be like making money.

i guess what it boils down to is this -

just because you have a budget, doesn't mean you need to spend all of it.

i know that's a fundamental idea, but i never realized how just changing my thought process would make it that much more enjoyable to save.

now i look at money saved as money made.

didn't buy lunch and ate at home? i just made $15.

didn't buy the more expensive brand and went with the generic version? i just made $7.

went to the movies on discount night and didn't get snacks? i just made $20.

constantly doing this has increased my savings dramatically, and its actually a fun concept to keep me motivated.",10

update: some of you have sent me some seriously amazing responses, great advice and even job offers.

some of you are asking about my p.t.s.d. i was not in the military. it was caused from something else. i keep erasing and re-writing these next lines because i feel like i should have to defend the reason i have p.t.s.d. the fact is. it sucks. you re-live something over and over playing it out in your head. i understood it at the time, i knew what it was. but i thought i could just splash water on my face get over it.. i fought it for years. maybe if i was brave enough to ask for help, instead of trying to deny that there was something wrong with me, these last few years could have been different. all i'm saying is that i came here for advice and got a ton of it. so the one thing i might be able to give back is that if you think something is wrong, you should seek help not shelter.

update 2: ""learn to code!"" i hear you guys, i am on it. python installed pycharm installed and i taking udemy courses. 

this thread will serve as a tool over the next week/s something i can really search through and hopefully find a path that i can follow.

"let's talk about a ""beater"". so i am the son of a mechanic of 35 years.  he's been able to keep up with the current technologies and has worked on some of the most basic and advanced vehicles in the modern era.

it pains me to see people say, ""buy a cheap reliable car"" as if that is something easy to do.  unless you know a good mechanic that has access to dealer trades and auctions it can be tough.  here in sw pa, cars over 150k miles are usually junk.  rust due to salt, transmissions blown due to hills, etc.  unless you live in the suburbs, cars are not garage kept.  my dad and i set out to find my grand mother a replacement car.  i gave her a 2005 grand prix in 2014 with no rust and in 4 years of being outside, the rockers cannot be patched anymore.

we looked at around 35 cars and unfortunately my dad is retired.  so he does not have access to dealer trades or auctions and most of his contacts have moved on or retired as well.  this is a compilation of what we saw.

&#x200b;

35 vehicles total

&#x200b;

20 costing between 4-8k

* 11 had rust beyond belief
* 6 had check engine lights for multiple things (dad had a scan tool)
* 3 had a fair bit cosmetic or mechanical issues (suspension or a ton of wear items)

&#x200b;

15 costing 8-12k

* 6 had too much rust
* 3 had check engine lights for multiple things
* 3 had a fair bit cosmetic or mechanical issues
* 2 were priced way over market value
* 1 we found for just over 12k that we bought (was listed at 14k)

we looked at a wide range of cars. sure about half were gm, but the rest were subaru's, toyota's and honda's.  so this idea that people can ""easily"" find a ""cheap but reliable"" beater is a but insane.  many of these cars would cost even us thousands to maintain for a year.  they could easily strand my grandmother as she travels to my uncles house every month (2 hour drive).  her old 2006 grand prix started to have issues, water pump, suspension work and the rockers were shot, patched 3 times.

now i am not advocating for buying a new car.  but we ended up reaching out to my other uncles and they all put together money for a 3 year old chevy trax for her.  it has far more safety features than her old car, does much better in every crash test, should be reliable for 3-5 more years, etc.  we could have gotten her a sonic/cruze but she didn't feel comfortable in them (too low and small) and she's in her 80's so comfort is a thing.

but the moral to the story is, when offering ""advice"" you need to understand that a ""cheap but reliable"" car is not an easy find and if you live up north very difficult to do in many cases.  don't assume that everyone has connections and has a reliable mechanic that can easily find good and cheap deals.  my dad found me that 05 grand prix that i drive for 5 years and it was about 8k when i bought it in 2009, but that was back when he had unlimited access to thousands of cars.

&#x200b;

\*\*\*edit\*\*\*i want to clarify something.  reasonably safe & reliable vehicles do exist under 5k.  even in my area.  out of 1 gem there are 10-20 pos junkers.  my point is, the average person cannot change their own oil.  they wait 6 months after the oil light comes on to change it, drives tires to the cords and didn't know you need to replace brake pads.  those same people also don't have a reliable mechanic, know someone at a dealership or someone who goes to auctions.  they do not have the know-how to find a cheap but reliable car.  and if you take a look at the marketplace or craigslist, people who are selling most of these cars say, ""only needs $20 part to pass inspection"".  and if you're on a 5k budget, can you afford to take 10-15 cars to a mechanic charging $100-150/car?

let's also take a look at safety.  back in the day, without automation, head-on collisions were far more common this is why there was not need to put the front brace all the way across the front of the car.  due to better safety features, small-overlap is more common.  you're 2004 civic has no front brace at a 15\* offset but that 2017 cadillac the other person is driving does.  so surviving a small overlap crash in an older vehicle is actually very low.

i am not saying buy a new or expensive car.  my point is, once you're financially sound, you should look to save and buy a more reliable and safe vehicle.  spending 10-14k on a cpo vehicle, unless you're in a financial mess is not a bad idea.  those sub 5k beats can cost more than double in maintenance in just 2-3 years.  take that 5k, put it down in a 2-3 year old cpo vehicle and pay off the other 5-9k over a 2-3 year period and drive that car for another 5 years.  if you have to get a beater, please get someone who can help because i've seen hundreds of people get swindled.

"i'm 19 years old and i have saved roughly 10k. what is the fastest way to grow it?. i have been working since i was about 15. i'm not a big spender at all and i've been saving it, mostly for college. i go to an inexpensive community college, and i have scholarships, so i won't be spending all my money on school. my parents have been nice enough to let me stay rent free while i go to school, and they also gave me a reliable car. i won't be working while i go to school because i have a packed schedule. 

i know basically nothing about economics or finances (except don't spend your money if you don't need to, obviously). is there something i can invest in to grow my savings substantially? like i said, i won't be working, so i won't be adding to what i've saved. also, i'm sorry if this is a stupid question. i looked at the guides posted here and most of it flew over my head.

update: 
thanks everyone for the advice. i posted this just before bed and woke up to an exploded post with lots of different opinions to listen to. the two big takeaways i have from this are 1) educate myself on finances before i make a decision and 2) keep doing what i'm doing and save money. it's really important to me to have financial independence and the freedom that brings, so i'm trying to take charge of what my money does. now to address the advice i've gotten:

after a bit more research i may put it in an ira like many have recommended. i agree that i should be looking for the best way to invest rather than the fastest way to make money. i'll definitely keep at least half of my savings for a rainy day fund. ive gotten some pms about book recommendations, which i really appreciate. i'll be heading to the local library soon. cryptocurrency is interesting to me since i'm a cs major, but i won't view that seriously as an investment since i don't fully understand it yet. i may take a couple hundred dollars and play around with it, though. i will also be looking into vanguard because that was mentioned a lot, too.

"saving tip: try to have 2 $0 spent days per week. a little trick that has really helped my wife and i spend less money is to try and have two days per week where we don't spend a single dollar. 

and it's actually a lot easier than you might think once you get used to it.

it really forces you to pack your own lunch, make a pot of coffee at home and avoid all those little (and unnecessary) expenditures that add up over course of a month. as a bonus, by forcing yourself to forego the pack of gum, diet coke and whatnot on your $0 days, you wind up cutting these things out naturally on the other days.

edit: just to address those who say this is nothing more than creative accounting that doesn't save you any money, there are dozens of types of expenses that we wouldn't ""make up"" on other days. 

if you don't buy a latte on tuesday and thursday because these are your no-spend days, you're unlikely to buy two on wednesday and friday to double-down and you're equally unlikely to buy an extra one the day before to sit in your car and wait for you.

and if you try and ""cheat"" by buying a case of diet coke and box of gum ahead of time, you're still saving a ton of money by buying in bulk. the cost of 24 cans of diet coke at the supermarket is the same as 5 from the machine at the office.

if you pass on that clever t-shirt you happen across but had no intention of buying you are unlikely to drive back the next day to get it on a ""spending day.""

you won't drink twice as much the next night because you passed on going to the pub after work with your mates on a non-spending day and you won't see two movies instead of one and on and on and on.

on top of all that, just getting into the mindset that it's possible to go a full day without spending a dollar starts the habit of watching how you spend every day.

clearly not every trick works for everyone and clearly if you're taking home a couple grand per week such a tip might be silly - but in our experience it absolutely helps.

edit 2: man...i love reddit, hahaha. some of the comments here are pure gold (no pun intended). yeah...i get it. some people are poor and don't make as much money as they'd like/need...but this is a totally separate issue. the reality is that, for all our bitching, most people in the first world do, in fact, earn enough money to have some sort of discretionary spending. sure, if you already have 4-5 days a week with $0 to spend this advice won't be relevant...but this is a totally unrelated issue.

and on the other shoe...yeah, i also get that some people earn so much money that saving a few grand a year on snacks, whizbangs and doodads won't make a real difference....but the majority of people don't earn six-figures and the majority of people do spend more than they truly need to in order to be happy.

at any rate...i had no idea this was going to blow up so big - it just kind of popped into my head this morning as i was drinking my coffee how big of a difference it's made for us to do this (it's been about 7 years now that we've more or less followed this pattern.)

all that being said, a couple years ago i posted about our success using the envelope system and the shit truly hit the fan, haha.",10
"you are never going to pay a gift tax. every single day someone comes in here and asks about ridiculous monetary-gifting workarounds to avoid paying gift tax. unless you come from a very wealthy family, gift tax is not something you are ever going to have to think about in your lifetime.

you can gift up to $14k per person per year without reporting anything. that means a married couple can gift a married couple $56k before any reporting is done.

the giver has to report all gifts above $14k per person per year. report, not pay taxes on. that's done on irs form 709.

above $14k per person per year, you can give away $5.45m in your lifetime without incurring any sort of gift tax.

only once you have given away $5.45m above the $14k per person per year does gift tax come in to play at all, and then gift tax is paid for by the giver, not the receiver.

so take that down payment from your parents, no one is going to tax anyone on it.

there are of course edge cases and scenarios, but odds are you'll be aware of those if you're gifting at the frequency or quantity where they apply. the moral of the story is that **if someone wants to give you a large amount of money, you as the recipient don't have to worry about anything**.",10
"my cost of insurance for next year is 1750% more even though i'm making significantly less, is this supposed to happen?. currently i have blue cross blue shield through aca if that's what the insurance on healthcare.gov falls under. i was making $14,000 a year when i applied for it last year, and my monthly payment was $16.00 with a $750.00 deductible. i'm a student who just moved back home so i can hurry and finish school, so i had to leave my previous job and am now driving for uber on the weekends. i will be making about $5,760 a year. when i went to apply for insurance again for next year, the lowest priced plan is $280 a month with a $7,350 deductible. that's an increase of $264 a month from my previous plan and a $6,600 increase in my deductible. all the while i'm making $8,240 less a year. after filling out my application, i also received an eligibility notice email from healthcare.gov stating....

"how i've gamified saving my money and why it's worked better than anything i've tried before.. i'm a tipped employee who takes home my main source of income on a daily basis, which can make it hard to budget correctly. it's easy to spend money when you constantly have a little cash in your wallet. recently, i decided to crack down, and actually came up with a system that has worked spectacularly. i have very minimal expenses and make a decent living, but i'm still shocked and proud of myself that i managed to save nearly $1500 in less than a month following this method. this plan might not work as well for those who take home a bi-weekly paycheck, but as someone who has lived off tips for over 10 years, it has worked amazingly. i think of it as a mashup as the envelope formula and gamifying your money.

i set a goal of putting away $55 every day from my tips, even on days i don't work. i set up an excel chart to track this.(http://imgur.com/lajglxd) i used a basic knowledge of the program to set up formulas tracking my goal, the actual amount saved, and how ""on track,"" i was based off how much money i decided to save for the day. 

the part that really gamified it for me was color coding the 'on track' column to either show red or green based on whether or not i was on par for my goal.  it actually became fun to know how much money i needed to put away every day to see the little box turn green, and even more fun to know when i was well over my goal. for some reason, this color coded excel chart helped me save money quicker than anything i've ever tried before, and i'm looking forward to continue using this method and seeing how much i can potentially save.

edit: since so many people have been asking, i thought i'd include a little idea of what my monthly budget looks like.

*rent: $500

*phone: $100

*electric: $75

*car insurance/gas : $100

*groceries: $300

*debt: $0

*everything else: $200-$400 (netflix, home supplies, eating out, personal care, etc.)

*total monthly budget: $1,275 - $1,475

*total needed net income to add $1,650 into savings plan: $2,925 - $3,125

"ate at a mcdonald's for breakfast this morning - card charged hundreds of times. i'm on vacation with my dad and brothers. we ate at a mcdonald's for breakfast on the way to the beach this morning. we used the self service kiosk. it took like 60 seconds for the purchase to go through, which seemed weird.

got to the beach, and stopped at a subway for lunch. card declined.

we called the bank, and apparently the mcdonald's has tried to charge my dad's card hundreds of times for the same purchase. we're at the beach now, and totally stranded because we have no money. we called the mcdonald's to try and get them to restart their self service kiosk, but of course, nobody there had any idea what the fuck we were talking about.

so we're stuck 3 hours away from home with no idea what to do.

edit: the issue has been resolved and the card is working!! thanks for all your advice!

edit 2: i know, we should have had more than a single debit card. my dad's 56 and probably not going to change his ways because some guy on reddit told him to. that being said, i'll definitely take note of your advice for my own personal finances once i'm a bit older.",10
"i was a witness to an auto accident - now i have a $500 collections bill for an ems/firetruck dispatch on my credit report. back a couple years ago i was a witness to a multi-car auto accident on the freeway where firetrucks, ambulances, and multiple tow trucks had to be called.  to preface, no damage was done to my vehicle.  no insurance claims were filed against me or on my behalf.  everyone in my vehicle was fine (albeit shaken) and we drove away from the scene after giving a statement.  these facts matter.

a week after the accident i received a bill for $500 for the fire/ems crews that showed up.  i immediately called the number on the bill and was told that everyone involved in the accident was charged $500 to recoup the cost of sending those crews out (isn't that what my taxes are for?) but not to worry because my insurance will cover it in my claim.  i told the guy i didn't file a claim because no damage was done to my vehicle and i only stayed as a witness.  i was told that if i was only a witness then i shouldn't be charged a fine and i need to write that in a letter and mail it to them for their records and they'll take care of it.  seems reasonable and simple enough so that's what i did.  

a few months go by and i receive the same $500 bill saying it's going to collections if i don't pay immediately.  i call the number again and tell them the same story.  they also tell me the same story - i need to write a letter and send it in to them.  i told them i already did that and they said maybe i didn't write things out clear enough and to write another letter and send it in.

this was 2 years ago and i thought everything was good to go because i never heard anything again.  apparently that's not the case because it proceeded to go to collections during this time and within the last 12 months i had this $500 bill show up on one of my credit reports dinging me 50 points.  i've disputed this collection through the credit reporting agency but it's still on my report.  what do i need to do to make this go away?  it's extremely frustrating.

**edit:** some things i forgot to mention:

* the guy i talked to on the phone the second time told me not to worry about it going to collections because their collections department was the guy 2 cubicles over from him. it never goes to a third party collector. if i write to the collections department, i'd be writing to the same office i've already written to.

* going to the news seems like a good idea as an anonymous person, but the practicality of putting my identity and face on tv to complain about my city government is a thought that terrifies me and is not something i'm interested in.

* i also no longer have the bill or the contact information from the agency that sent it to me.  how can i find this?

"i'm in high school and my parents can't teach me the basics of money management. to put it simply my parents just aren't great role models when it comes to budgeting, much less saving. they live paycheck to pay check, and spend money recklessly. i know this because i have compared my parents' habits to those of people who are a bit better off (like the helpful advice people leave on this sub lol) we don't live poorly, but definitely not comfortably. no savings, nothing for my future. 

it's just difficult, mainly because i don't really know what to do with the money that i rarely get, other than spend it. i know to save about 20%? but i feel like i could do more. i just need advice for planning for what to do with my money before and when go to college and other expenses when i move out.

i don't have a job currently, but i am planning on getting one. also, i tried looking up money management videos on youtube, but i think that is geared more towards adults.

just any tips or helpful advice would be greatly appreciated. i can also answer questions :)

"is living on 13$ a day possible?. i calculated how much money i have per day until i'm able to start my new job. it came out to $13 a day, luckily this will only be for about a month until my new job starts, and i've already put aside money for next months rent. my biggest concern is, what kind of foods can i buy to keep me fed over the next month?
i'm thinking mostly rice and beans with hopefully some veggies. does anybody have any suggestions? they would be much appreciated. thank you.

"i am 26 and am in a position to save heavily for retirement, but maxing out my retirement accounts seems to be too focused on retiring at 55+. i have enough extra income every month to where i want to get a very focused and disciplined plan going on saving for retirement. i have hit this weird realization though: if i were to put every penny i had toward my ira/401k, i could put in over 20k before i reached the contribution limits. if i understand these accounts correctly, i can't touch any of this money until around the age of 57.

so here is my question:

"discovered i make $1.50 more an hour than new hires - after being at the job for 7 years.. we are in dire need of staff which i assume is the reason for the higher than normal starting wage. but i feel underappreciated because of this. 

imo if they can afford to pay new people as much as they are, they can afford to pay me more. 

is it wrong of me to ask for a few more dollars per hour raise with this being the only reason? it's been awhile(a year or so) since i have gotten a raise and perhaps i'm using this as an opportunity to ask for more?

i'm not sure if i am thinking about this correctly. 



thoughts? 

thanks in advance.


edit: the consensus is that it is wrong to consider asking for a raise simply due to how much new hires are making, regardless of time in the company considering my work ethic. i agree but was not seeing it that way.

if anyone has more to add beyond that i would be happy to hear it.

i appreciate the answers and honesty. thank you all.

edit two: well this got bigger than expected. i cannot express how much the priceless advice means to me. i have been humbled in more ways than one. 

i promise i will reply to everyone when not on mobile. i really really really appreciate everything said, good and bad. i needed the kick in the teeth honestly. i apologize to those i reacted to negatively in the beginning. i see your point of view and respect it. 

what a great sub this is. i work nights so it's time for housework now. i *will* get back to you all tonight. 

thank you. thank you. thank you again.

.

edit three: so i have spent several hours replying to as many people as i can, but i'm saying much the same thing to everyone so i'll just say it here. 


 i have learned quite a few things from this post. i think an honest upfront conversation with my manager is in order, with the knowledge it may lead nowhere. i have not done any research into what someone with my position and experience is worth. if it had been another, larger, company than my current one i can only assume i would of had more *opportunity* to move up. **but** considering my attitude towards my current line of work / the way i have approached it these past 5 years(coasting), i do not think i would have received those promotions. and that's okay. that just means i need to change. i need to improve.


*i need to move on.* 

this job is not something i would have pictured working for 7 years when i was fresh out of high school. i like the work but it's just not for me anymore. it's not a career by any means. a career is something i have thought about for a long time. something i really want. i am not sure what was holding me back, fear complacency laziness? probably all of the above. i regret wasting so much of my time. 



so in regard to the main point here: i do understand and agree that tenure *alone* is not sufficient for a raise, and is certainly a weak argument to make to your boss *if* in that time i have not provided more than a body for the company. which is the case for me. i also understand the need for the higher wages the new employees will be earning. seems to simply be a market value thing. we need people badly, so it only makes sense you would offer more money to draw people in. i can respect that in conjunction with my current wage considering the effort i put in and all i offer. 

i really appreciate the advice, the kind words, and you sharing your experiences with me. i needed to hear *all* of it. it has helped me in so many ways. this post will literally change my life, even outside of my job. i won't be replying to many more people, but i will be reading every comment. 

sorry for the wall of text. considering what this has all meant to me, i felt the need to express it. 

take care everyone, best of luck to you and yours. i appreciate it, so much.",10
"highly recommend a ""fun money"" savings account.. my wife and i recently started one and we put in a little from each paycheck. whenever we do something fun, such as a small date night or a mini (for now) vacation, we don't feel guilty about spending the money anymore.  it's honestly an amazing feeling and i recommend it to all.",10
"someone used a fake check to pay for groceries at a food chain and chase refuses to refund my money.. after answering their questions, they claim that i took care of my checkbook improperly and that is how the information was compromised. however, they authorized a check that is vastly different than my checks (not even the same routing #) and that has a signature that looks nothing like mine. doesn't this seems like something they should have a responsibility to protect me against? what else am i paying them a fee every month for?

edit: also they said another reason they can't refund the money is that i have shopped at this particular grocery store chain in the past. they refuse to even look into whichm branch the check was used at. they just immediately rejected my claim within minutes on the phone.

edit 2: thanks so much everyone! i'll be filing a police report and then going into a branch to get this taken care of. i will update later today when i know something else.

edit 3: a police report has been filed and we are waiting on an investigator to follow up with us on that. we visited a chase branch and the banker spent 2+ hours with dealing with the fraud department (as of now the case is reopened but no promises yet) and also moving the money to a new account). not sure if we will stay with chase, but the very patient and kind banker has helped ease my nerves and i'm okay with waiting a bit to see what the fraud department does. i will update again when i know more from the fraud department or the police investigator. we are also going to be filing an identity theft report with the ftc when we arrive home. thank you to everyone who has helped me out so far. the information has been super invaluable and you all have received reddit silver from me.

edit 4. still waiting to hear back from chase, but we received a letter from the police department saying they won't investigate due to little evidence. they must have sent it immediately for the snail mail to reach us that fast. i tweeted out to the grocery chain with the information i had so they may be able to provide any more details to the police and have the investigation reopened.

final update: chase decided to refund the money. only took like weeks of fighting with them haha. turns out the grocery store is also doing their own investigation into the issue. we will see what they say, but i don't expect much. thank you to everyone involved here who gave such wonderful advice!!!",10

"lost my job ($55k) in jan. company is making it hard to find new employer. barely making ends meet w/unemployment. downsized everything i can think of. single mom.. ive been in the marketing realm (seo) for 8 years now. in january, i lost my job. 
i qualified for unemployment and went from making $4100/month to 'making'  $1700 month on unemployment. 

i have downsized everything i can think of. canceled att ($122/month) for mint mobile ($20 for 3 months promo, then switches to like $30/month.)
switched car insurance from geico to root ($97/month to $61/month for the same coverage)

i can't pull my daughter from daycare ($650/month, i pay half)  because they also take her to and from kindergarten, and while i'm employed it's impossible for me to leave and take her/pick her up (kindergarten is only 3 hours and i work a 9-5. this day care is incredible and also way less than most in the area. it's got a massive wait list and she's been going there since she was 1.5, she's now 6.)

my car needs work (rotor and barring replacement) that i can't currently afford. and i am taking public transportation even though it's usually 2+ miles walking minimum because i can't drive my car. 

my credit is frozen. there were 2 maxed out credit cards in collections ($7k and $4k) way above their limits and my credit went from 655 to 481. i do not have any credit cards but these did have my name on them and an address i used 2-3 years ago. i can't open any credit cards while this is resolved. i have filed a police report but this just adds one more layer of financial mess.

i know i interview well. i have had potential employers tell me they've never even interviewed someone 'of my caliber' for the position they have open, that they will 'call me monday for a final interview' and then ghost. that's happened three times. i will reach out, and these employers who have been blowing up my phone are suddenly gone. i finally got a hold of one of them and they said my former employer contacted them and said i stormed out, threw things, and took off 'over 30 days of work, unexcused.' none is that is even remotely true. my being let go was a shock to me as i'd never even been written up, but the company was going through financial hardship and i was the newest team member who also was salaries unlike my employees. (they combined some teams to save money.) i had taken off a total of 3 days in 9 months, all but one were approved in advance. (emergency illness which they made me prove my daughter was at the doctor, which i did prove, which was odd to me. i had 10 days of pto accrued that i never touched.)

i pay $1100/rent, $450/car (paid off in 9 months) and spend $100/month in groceries. i have a personal loan that is paid off in 4 months that's $190/month that can't be set out, i've asked.  i spend next to nothing outside of that. i've sold most of my nice clothes (except for 3 professional interview outfits.) 

what can i do? should i just remove that employer from my experience altogether? is there something else i even can cut back on? i made my rent in 2 payments in february and they said it would be a $50 fee (over the phone) but it ended up being $400 late fee! i don't have any savings. i don't have any credit cards. in february my boyfriend was kind enough to make my car payment. i'm applying to jobs like crazy but now that i know why i've been ghosted.. i just don't know what to do. i've never been unemployed before and it's really starting to impact me mentally. ill continue looking for jobs of course and i miss working. but this is just insane. i need to stay afloat and $1700 a month is not livable for me. 


note: bf is moving in on april 14 and will pay $450/month in rent. 


tl;dr: lost job. income went from $4100 to $1700/month. cut back on phone bill and car insurance. cut out all eating out and entertainment. sold clothes. looking for ways to make ends meet and ideas/insight. i'm just at a loss of what to even do. 


edit: since multiple people are asking and i can't seem to keep up with comments- no child support/alimony/etc. we split all child related bills 50/50 because we make (made) similar income and have split custody. i will be unemployed temporarily and do not want to take money from him. he is a great dad and has brought over a ton of food for her while i look for a job. getting child support would be temporary and i really don't see that as the solution here as it could damage our co-parenting relationship.

edit 2: i'm assuming that the *potential employer* called the *previous employer* to verify employment. they told me the previous employer called them, but it makes a lot more sense the other way around. i agree. i wrote this out based on the info i had.

also-for those of you calling me mental, borderline, bipolar, etc- my mental health is okay. sit down. i am stressed. being home applying for jobs all day can stress you out. i get that my situation is weird. you don't have to believe me- but move along. my life is chaotic and i don't feel like defending myself against you anymore. 

groceries: i only eat veggies. (yes. i make chicken or turkey for my kid. vegetarian is my choice, i don't push it on her but she does love salad.) frozen veggies are cheap. i have so much veggies! and i mostly make curries for me, rice and chicken or noodles and chicken for my kid. she loves ramen. and a side of veggies. so yeah. $100-$120/month. not a typo.

"learn from my mistakes. if your employer promises you something, get it in writing. my former employeer screwed me out of two grand one month before my wedding. so ill start from the beginning. a few years ago i lost my front tooth, and couldnt afford to get a new one. company i worked for, whos name i wont disclose, promised me they were going to pay for me to get a permanent tooth. my supervisor approached me one day while i was out in the yard working, and told me that as a wedding present they would be buying me a new tooth. i never asked them to buy me one, but they wanted to thank me for the hard work and time i put into the company, and also make sure i looked good for the wedding pictures. i was so happy and so was my fiance. it was the nicest thing any company had ever done for me before, and i was very grateful for them. they made an appointment for me to go to their company dentist, and i got my date to get my bridge. now a day before the appointment, they told me to cancel the appointment, because they wanted to try and find a better deal. apparently he was charging them too much money and they wanted me to go someplace cheaper. this was a red flag to me, but they seemed sincere and assured me they were working on something for me. so i canceled and waited. this should have been my first warning sign that they had no intention of paying for my tooth.

two months went by, and they didnt tell me anything. i was starting to think that they were going to bail on their offer, but any time i asked about it they kept assuring me they would honor the agreement. last month they laid me off, and during the comversation my supervisor assured me they were honoring the agreement to pay for my tooth. my supervisor brought up the tooth, i didnt even ask about it. i had assumed they werent going to pay for it anymore. he assured me the company was going to pay for it and honor that agreement. they told me they would be in touch with me once they worked something out. well i went to a family friend and got the work done (for a discount also.) when i gave them the bill, they informed me that they had never intended to pay for my bill. they told me they had no idea who told me that (despite 4 managers proudly telling it to me) and said i had to pay for it myself. not only did they refuse to pay, but they made me look dumb for thinking they ever told me they were going to do it. i was furious. the only reason i got the work done was because they promised me they were going to do it.

so now here i am with a dental bill, because i trusted my employer to honor their promise. there is also nothing i can do about it, because it wasnt in writing and i cannot prove they promised to pay for it. i also know this is my own fault, i was stupid for not trusting my instincts. so if your employer promises you a raise, to pay for something, or to do anything for you. always, and i cannot stress this enough, always get it in writting. 

edit: this got a lot more traction then i thought it would. i want to thank everyone for their kind words, as well as others who were more harsh. listening to users here, i have decided to sit down with a lawyer and look into legal action against my former employeers. i know this upsets some users, but i am not the kind of person who just jumps into things without planning first. ive already made a lot of mistakes, i want to try and avoid any other ones. i will speak to the lawyer, and send an email to my boss asking for a more detailed explanation as to why they are no longer paying. as always, you guys are awesome and thank you!",10
"about that $5 cup of coffee. in the world of personal finance, i often encounter people talking about that daily trip to starbuck's, to buy that $5 cup of coffee as an example of an easy overindulgence to cut. and it's totally true--if you're spending $5 on a cup of coffee every single day, that's $35 a week, or like $150 a month. for a lot of us a $150 monthly bill would easily be in the top ten recurring expenses, if not higher. and sure, that's an easy thing to cut out if we're trying to slim down, right? 

all totally correct. however, i think we can sometimes get a little too overzealous in our drive to frugality. to me, the point of managing your expenses on a daily basis isn't simply to get them as low as possible, but to actually think about what's important to you and what's worth it. the point of managing your money is to figure out what you care about, and what you can afford, and to be able to allow yourself to do the things you want to do without stressing about whether you'll be crushed under a mountain of debt if you do. 

personally, i love going to coffee shops. i love chit chatting with the barrista while they make my coffee. i love getting out of the house, i love reading the paper or surfing the web while i sip coffee that someone else has made for me in an environment that's carefully curated to be beautiful and welcoming. that's easily worth $5 a day to me. 

the overall point being: when it comes to your daily budget, i don't think there's ever a one-size-fits-all rule. it's more about what's important to you in life, and what tradeoffs you're willing to accept. 

now, i'm gonna go head out to a coffee shop for a little bit. ",10
"when buying a used car, always get a prepurchase inspection!. for the last few years i've been driving a 2009 nissan versa hatchback. it's been a  great little car, but it was old and starting to fall apart, and then i found that it was burning oil at an alarming rate. so for the past month or so i've been hunting around to see what i can find. 

&#x200b;

i found a 2014 ford focus se hatchback that had all the options i would get had i bought it new; leather interior, fog lamps, sport package (you get rear disc brakes with this, very important) and a manual transmission. focus' are super good deals right now if you get the manual, because the automatic transmissions were absolute garbage and brought down the value of the car across the board, but the rest of the car is well made. 

&#x200b;

the car was advertised around $7500 with around 71k miles, both kbb and edmunds valued the car around $8k if it was in ""excellent"" condition. so i put a deposit down on the car on the condition i could get a prepurchase inspection. on a car this old with this many miles, i didn't expect anything too crazy, and from the outside it looked and drove fine. 

&#x200b;

well guess what, it needs about $1100 of suspension work! i go back to the dealer and say ""i want to buy this car today, and i'm fine with the price it's at, but not the work it needs. to sell me this car, you can either a) fix what needs to be fixed or b) knock $1100 of the price and i'll have it fixed.""

&#x200b;

 well they decided to knock the price of the repairs off the price, and i drove off in my car. always get a prepurchase inspection on used cars, no matter how nice they look or good they drive! ",10

"$85,000 medical bill down to $7,500. i'm sorry if this is the wrong place but i wanted to share because i'm pretty sure i learned about this here. 

my wife makes just enough to not qualify for medical assistance but not enough to afford her own. she had an extremely bad asthma attack (exacerbated asthma attack?) and ended up in the hospital for about a week. we knew it was going to cost us but i was genuinely scared i was losing her so i didnt care. thanks to this sub, i think, i knew to immediately request financial aid from the hospital. 

before we heard from them though the bills started coming in. totalled more than 85,000 but that's the gist. we just heard back that they dropped it down to 7,500. itll still be a tough few years because we dont make much but its do able. 85,000 was not going to be do able... so thank you, whoever at some point shared that tidbit and potentially saved our financial future.

"landlord forgot to pay our water bill so our water was shut off. is it fair to ask for a month's free water?. i hope this is the right sub!  i moved into a new rental house on february 7th.  the landlord said that he keeps the water bill in his name and provides up bills to pay him, he then pays the water company.  we gave him a $300 water deposit ahead of moving in (in addition to our security deposit).  yesterday, february 26, we come home from work to find a note from the utility and our water shut off.  we call the landlord immediately and he is super apologetic and gets us buckets of tap water to use to flush the toilet.  my husband, myself, and my infant daughter got ready and off to work/daycare with no running water.  landlord called the utility and they said it will be back on within 24 hours meaning i don't know if there will be running water when i get home or not. my landlord has not offered or brought up a discount at all!  only apologizing over and over again.  is it fair for me to push for a month's free water?  i know it was only one day but i had dirty dished, i couldn't cook dinner, couldn't shower or bathe my child for work.  even washing my hands was a pain in the ass.  


tl;dr: water got shut off for a day (maybe 2 days) because landlord didn't pay bill.  what kind of discount/reimbursement should i request?


edit/update:  thank you everyone for the feedback!  my take away is that, yes, a month's free water is way too much to ask (darn!).  my intention is to ask for the days without water removed from the rent bill.  i pay $2300 in rent so accounting for 28 days in the month, that would $82 for each day (or i could calculate 30 days).  i want to add- i am on great terms with my landlord and will always strive to be a good tenant.  even though i am upset (because i had a sink full of dishes and a washer full of baby clothes, and i can now smell myself at my desk due to no shower, i'm a pumping mom so my pump stuff smelled like sour milk this morning and i had to wash it in the office sink), i wouldn't express this to him that way - always professional & kind.  we plan to live in this home for 3-5 years so i don't want to negatively impact that in any way.

2nd edit:  i should add that $82 or $164 (will find out when i get home tonight) will be at least equal to or greater than one month water bill, ha!",10

"keeping a car in storage for five years (for an 11 year old). my father recently passed away and did not leave a will. he had a 2014 chevy sonic that he used to get around town that he used to jokingly say that he would give to my niece some day to drive.  she's 11.

my mother (divorced) and my sister want to park that car next to my sister's house (we live in the sw desert) for the next six years so that my niece will have a car when she turns 16.  this would be a minimal cost, storage insurance, etc.

i proposed that instead we sell it now (while it's worth more) and take that money and put it into a cd for five years (where it will grow) and then use the money to get a newer car at 16.   i know of no teenager that has ever thought they would rather drive a beater from grandpa's estate than something a little nicer and newer.

i don't see a downside to this but they are absolutely adamant about it.

i told them i'd make a reddit post and someone would know how to make this make sense to them.

"for the first time in my 20+ years of being an adult, i have $0 in credit card debt after christmas.. i know this may seem a bit crazy to have just now broken that barrier, and in the end we still spent far too much as a whole... but the fact that there is no debt is a massive, massive victory that we have never accomplished before, and we still have a (for our current situation) decent amount left in savings. 

if you'd have told me this would be my future even a year ago, i'd never have believed we would get our heads above water. 

for anyone who doesn't think they can, keep trying. never give up. don't get yourself down. we all slip, like with my past food addiction i never succeeded until i stopped beating myself up about mistakes. 

we had like $70k in debt, and are on a direct track for that to disappear. we even have cards we haven't been able to close with a decent amount of credit, but we did not touch *once* this season. 

compared to a few years ago where every single card was maxed out continuously, and where available credit was like a sign saying ""free money!"" i could not be happier. 

that's all. i just needed to say this out loud, both as a tooting of my own horn, but also to solidify it for me and remind me if i struggle. 

i don't post here like ever, but this sub has made a difference. if it weren't for reddit, i may never have gotten a good consolidation loan. so thanks. 

have an awesome new year. 

**e: oh holy night, *now* i understand ""rip my inbox"" comments, but couldn't be happier.**

thanks to everyone who replied, it means the world! for those with questions i do intend to get back to you, and for those posting words of encouragement, thank you so much for that. 

one question i've gotten a lot is how we did it. that was the part that surprised us. we have a house with minimal equity, which helped a small amount with using that equity to pay down a fraction of our debt, but it was the chunk we needed to get the okay on our consolidation loan (and banks love to have *all* of your accounts). combined that with our reasonable income (i'm on disability but my wife makes a high 5 figure salary so it gave us a good footing) and the fact that we have not missed a minimum bill payment and it provided us the leverage we desperately needed. 

i can say that one of the best things you can have under your belt is to be able to go to the bank with a positive payment history. too many late payments really mess with your credit score, so even if you can *only* just make the minimum payment, do that! 

cutting costs and trying to be more pragmatic is the other huge step that we needed to make. i worked hard to get my health in shape and doing that made my propensity for impulse and worthless spending easier to control. it may sound cliche, but i remember starting to change when winter soldier came out, i realized i had about 20k in debt id racked up on a card and had been putting off telling my wife about it every time she asked for a balance. my days were absolutely miserable. i was trying with all my power to avoid telling her, and finally admitting it was *hard as hell*, but we made it through it. 

it is possible to do it, because if someone who has as much of an addiction to buying useless shit as i do can, it's possible for anyone else. like quitting smoking or losing weight, you very well *may* stumble or even fail. that's natural. do *not* let that get you down, please don't. we are human and we are all fucked up in our own unique ways, getting out of debt is a very weird and challenging part of life, it may feel like a slog (it sure has for years) and you may get to the ground floor and fail again (this is not our first rodeo with consolidation loans) but if you persist, you may just be able to succeed. 

again, it's cliche but if you fall, pick yourself up again and get back into the fray. don't let debt win. it's not worth living your life running to try and play catch-up. that new thing you *must*  have feels that way for a very short time after you buy it, and that feeling goes away.  and when it's gone the only solution is to buy more and more, but being debt free and being able to buy that cool thing without having to go insane figuring out how you'll ever pay it off is **way fucking better.**

thank you all, again. you've fucking made my christmas and new year. ",10
"i am about to receive a large (~$30k) single advance payment for consulting work out of college. i have no prior experience as an independent contractor, no retirement savings, no accountant and no investment portfolio. this money is to last me for the next six months. where do i start?. ",10
"when buying a car, don't get hung up on silly crap and talk yourself into a worse deal. so i had a customer who really wanted 0% financing on his vehicle. the thing is we didn't have 0% financing offers on the vehicle he wanted. he however did have good credit and and got 2.99% apr. but he said he'd only buy from us if we could offer him 0%

he had a discount on his vehicle of about $3,000 so i emailed a loan officer i work with alot (who had offered him the 2.99%) and i asked her if we wrote their bank a check for $3,000 would they let us buy the rate down to 0%.

long story short the bank said yes, because well $3,000 was more interest (not by a lot, but it was still more) then they would have made at 2.99% and they got all their profit up front.

so we took the $3,000 discount away from the customer, he financed his car at 0% and ended up with a slightly higher payment and walked away feeling like he just won the lottery.

my customer made the critical mistake of getting so hung up, on one little detail he negotiated himself into a worse deal. now at the end of the day, my customer is only going end up paying about $200 more then he would have...but still.

also i did point out to the customer he was in fact paying more for the car at 0% then at 2.99% but he said it didn't matter cause of all the interest he'd save...he didn't get it, i sold a car, life goes on.

"things teens should know about how their parents may steal from them. i' m a parent of a grown up adult that we always treated fairly. she always kept money she earned and gifts and on her 18th birthday, we encourage her to change her custodial account to hers alone and we never obtained credit in her name.

&#x200b;

when i was 18, i was given $10k by my grandfather to assist with my education and my mother kept it. as a result of him finding out it wasn't used for the intended purpose, my siblings never got a similar donation.

i thought that was rare and unusual at the time.

&#x200b;

i am sadly flabbergasted by the tales on reddit of all the ways that parent figure out to rip off their own children.  stealing their money and identity theft as well as straight up blackmail, coercion and emotional manipulation to wring as much money out of young adults as possible. there are daily posting on legal advice and personal finance about these situations.

&#x200b;

i am wondering if those of us on personal finance could write a comprehensive guide for teens and young adults to these situations and how to best protect themselves.

i'm not talking about how to balance a checkbook stuff, but more along the lines of ""how to make sure your parents aren't ripping you off and ruining your financial future""

under 18, you're kinda screwed if parents get their hands on money intended for you. the best thing to do is to keep them from getting it in the first place. if you have generous relatives that give you monetary gifts, there are a few things you can do to try to accomplish this. since these relative are giving you gifts, that means they care about you. try to develop a good relationship so that you can have direct and honest discussions with them. that means engaging them during family visits and treating them respectfully. often, if your parents are financially irresponsible, other family members may not be aware.  i wouldn't recommend telling grandma you parents are gambling away your birthday present, but you should try to point out that you are not receiving the gifts they intend for you.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

first, for small amounts, you can request that the relative create a **""joint minor account""** in their name and your name rather than giving the money to you directly.  a typical minor account must have an adult and a child as the holders, but the adult does not have to be a parent.  if only you and your aunt are holders of a joint account, your parents cannot legally withdraw money from that account.

&#x200b;

if a relative is giving you a large gift, you may want to ask them to create a **""custodial account""** in their name and your name. custodial accounts are regulated by **universal transfer to minors acts (utma)** in most states.  a custodial account is controlled by the adult and the beneficiary usually cannot withdraw money until they are 21, but only the custodian can withdraw money prior to the beneficiaries 21st birthday, so parents cannot withdraw from the account. custodial accounts can also be created for securities and inheritances.

&#x200b;

you could ask them to change the way they give you gifts in thank you note. for example:

&#x200b;

dear uncle bob,

thank you for the birthday gift of $100. i would love to tell you i used it to buy a nice gift, but actually mom took the check to save for when i'm grown up. i'm not really sure she is keeping very good track of your gifts and i think she probably used the money to buy a pair of manolo blahniks. would you consider opening a minor account in your name and my name so that your gifts will end up benefiting me personally? an account at a credit union usually has no fees for a minor account and is easy to open.

&#x200b;

that way you can make a gift into the account and i can use it when i am 18.  i hope you won't mention this to mom because she is sensitive about discussing how she keeps track of your gifts with me.

&#x200b;

please let me know so i can give you my information needed for an account.

&#x200b;

your neice,

roberta

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

a few things could happen.

uncle bob will open an account for you and you will ultimately be able to access the gifts when you are older.

or

uncle bob will stop sending your mom $100 for your birthday.

or

uncle bob may tell your mom and she will be mad and she will continue to keep your money, but this is how things are going now, right?

"treasurydirect.gov isn't talked about enough. i see a lot of discussions on where the best bank to park your cash is, who has the best interest rates etc. i rarely see anyone mention treasury direct as an option. it's the website to buy treasury securities from the us government directly. the website is easy to use and navigate, setting up an account takes 5 minutes, and links directly to your pre existing bank account. 4 week tbills are currently yielding over 2.4%, which is more than you can get pretty much anywhere else. for cash management purposes i would highly recommend checking it out, especially if you're saving for something like a house and can't take any risk. they offer automatic reinvestments for up to two years at a time than you can vance whenever you want, and the website does a great job of explaining everything for you. if you're concerned about having your money locked up for 4 weeks at a time, you can split the money into 1/4s and buy the auction each week, set them to auto reinvest and if you end up needing the money stop the auto reinvestments and the cash will be deposited back into your bank account at the end of the term.

there are no fees, and no minimums, all your money stays in your current bank and is withdrawn when you purchase a security. proceeds from maturity are automatically sent back to your bank unless you reinvest. plus it's the us government so you don't have to worry about who you're doing business with, or have to keep searching and switching banks to find the best rates.",10

"just found out my parents have had 70k for me in a low yield savings account for 25 years and haven't saved for retirement. hi pf!

i just got off the phone with my mother who recently informed me that i have 70k in a savings account that my parents have been keeping for me since i was born. 

it turns out they have just been letting this money sit in a savings account that by my calculation has an interest rate of 0.6%. i'm a bit frustrated that they let a large sum of money sit in a savings account for 25 years rather than investing at least some of it. don't get me wrong, i am extremely grateful that my parents put aside an account for me that they had been putting all of my gift money into from the time that i was born and i truly appreciate their thinking of me and planning for my future. 

the account is currently in my mother's name and she doesn't know the first thing about investing (nor does she trust the markets which is why she never invested the money). what steps can she take to make better use of this sum of money? i also just found out that she has not saved any money for retirement and since i am fairly well off i would like to gift most of this money to her when the time comes. 

**tl;dr** - mother has 70k in a savings account for me and hasn't saved at all for her own retirement. where should we put this money for it to grow the most over the next 10 or so years? current savings account has interest rate of .6%. 


**edit:** thank you so much everyone for the support! i definitely was not expecting this many responses when i posted this this morning. i'm at lunch now and will respond to people individually when i get off work later but here are some answers to questions i am seeing come up. 

the money is primarily from stock that my grandfather purchased for me in my name when i was born. my parents had a falling out with that grandparent and did not trust him with my best interests so my mother requested to take control of the money. she doesn't trust the market so cashed it out and put it in a savings account.

i love my mother to bits and pieces but she wasn't raised with money and doesn't have a good sense in investing or handling money. her father did not save for retirement so she never felt the need to do so either. my father does have a retirement account but i am unsure how much he has saved. my parents are very humble people who live in a small and affordable town and have no debts. 

my plan is to take control of the money and make it grow over the next 5-10 years and then gift it to them every month to help them live comfortably. i have never invested myself before but know enough to know that i can get more from that money over the next few years. i'd really appreciate your guidance on how to make that happen.

it was a big pain in the ass to do this but i really look forward to the days where i will take an hour or so to reconcile my transactions and make near term plans in my budget. hopefully this helps you to track your spending and really know what's going on.

**edit:** a lot of salt here from people that are upset i don't pay for housing or food but many don't realize i've worked hard in my career to get here and that there are thousands of opportunities out there that do the same, you just need to look for them. room and board are part of my compensation, they aren't free! if i were making 15k more a year and mailed out a mortgage check every month would that make all of you happier?

when i lived in california, i was making ~72k for the same job so this is a substantial paycut. the difference, obviously, is that my col is so low out here. i do, however, trade that low col for things that you probably take for granted. i live on a small isolated and very remote island, i can't just leave whenever i want to and i can't just take off for the weekend or the night. i literally live thousands of miles from all my friends and family. the availability of goods is very limited and we face shortages often. the internet is very slow and relatively expensive and goods take weeks to make it out here if you order online. my entertainment options are extremely limited compared to a lot of places. i don't pay at the cafeteria but the food quality isn't that great and i don't choose what they make, i eat whatever they decide to make that day. i have to put up with a ton on inane rules that i have absolutely no say in. sometimes, staring at the same three square miles and seeing the same faces every single day gets a little old. infrastructure is crumbling, flights are super expensive in and out, my room is only about 400 sq ft of space, etc. etc.

there are many other good points of living here, which is why i've stayed as long as i have but you can see that there are definite drawbacks to living a lower col life.

**edit 2:** this isn't supposed to be me advocating people live a lifestyle or have a budget like i do, it's me advocating tracking your expenses and analyzing them thoroughly so that you can control where your money goes. aka read the title",10
"""the best time to look for a job is when you don't need one."". really, the best time to look for anything is when you don't need it, but this is specifically about job hunting and how it worked out for me. 

the quick background: i've been in manufacturing 20+ years, mid-level management for the last who knows how long. i happen to love my current job. i have a great crew, good benefits, a boss that let's me run my department with very little interference, close to home... etc. the pay, definitely below industry standards, but people put up with it because of the perks. basically, you trade lack of stress for lack of pay. 

a long time ago, i was told that you should always keep an eye out, never get too comfortable, so i did. over the last few years, i applied for a few different jobs, and listed very high salary requirements knowing that if i didn't get an offer, i'd be okay because i was in a job i enjoyed. 

i received an offer recently for a position i have a great deal of experience with, and was able to negotiate a 53% increase in salary. similar benefits (though obviously i don't know about the team, etc). i hit it off with my new boss very well in the interview, i have no worries there. 

i'm very excited about this position, and thought i would share with the rest of pf that even if you're happy, keep an eye out, and take a shot at improving your wage bracket. you have nothing to lose by asking for what you want (if you're in a position you're okay with being patient with for a little while). you just might find out someone thinks you're worth it. ",10
"the best time to look for a job is when you have a job - solid evidence from the federal reserve. there is an old piece of conventional wisdom, that the best time to look for a job is when you already have a job.  a recent study by the federal reserve bank of new york provides solid evidence that that is the case:

**do the employed get better job offers?(http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2018/04/do-the-employed-get-better-job-offers.html)** (federal reserve bank of new york)

> . . . we want to compare how job offers received by the nonemployed compare to those received by the employed . . . the most striking result is that there are very large wage differences associated with these offers: on average, employed job seekers receive hourly wage offers that are 39 log points (48 percent) higher than those received by the nonemployed. even after controlling for the observable characteristics of the job seeker and the employer offering the job, the employed receive wage offers that are still 22 log points (23 percent) higher, on average. 

that's a big difference - a very big difference.  there follows some discussion on why exactly the difference is so big.  (my own experience suggests that people who are already employed only look for jobs that are strict upgrades from their current position, so are more selective in what they apply for in the first place.)

that obviously is not good news for those who are unemployed.  but it suggests a few general ideas to guide the job search.

**don't quit a job until you have an offer for another in hand.** (as stated in the pf wiki(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/leaving_job#wiki_before_resigning_or_if_you_are_at_risk_of_being_let_go.2flaid_off).)  it's not just that being unemployed is *really* expensive - although it is - it's also that your prospects for finding another job are worse than if you stuck with the last one.

**consider starting early in looking for the next job if it looks like layoffs or an unlivable work situation are headed your way.**  waiting until you get the pink slip is a really bad idea.  even if the layoffs never materialize, you'll have expanded your business network by meeting with other potential employers.

**consider taking interim or temporary work while engaged in a long-term job search.**  ""what are you doing right now"" is a terrible question if the answer is ""nothing"".  being full-time looking for new work looks good on paper, but see the statistics cited above - it's bad for job offers.  taking a temporary position, even something like an unpaid internship (you don't have to tell them how much you're currently making - or not making), can improve your position in negotiating a new position.",10

"if you are moving/just moved, make sure you sign up for the amazon move discount. discount is 10% off on purchases ""shipped and sold by amazon.com"" for 3 months after you arrive. i found my coupon when i changed my address online with the postal service and they showed some promotions afterward. a lot of people might not find out about this until after they already move in and miss out and buy some big ticket items without the discount.



as far as i can tell, amazon doesn't actually verify whether you moved or not so do with that info what you'd like. i'm not sure about posting links here but the easiest place i have found is to just google ""slick deals amazon move discount""

also, since i just moved, id love some other tips/tricks/discounts on saving money due to a move:)

edit: i see a lot of people commenting on boycotting amazon for their treatment of workers, and i would urge you if this is something really important to you, to look at other companies (such as fedex and walmart) and their warehouse conditions. amazon may not treat their workers the best but they are far from the worst in an infrastructure of warehouses that makes our current society possible. i'm not judging any of you commenting :), just hoping to shed some light on a lot more people getting treated unfairly but without the national coverage being that this has kinda blown up.",10

"im 24 and i feel like my financial situation will suffocate me for the rest of my life.. i'd like to be a little open about all my finances for a second. i'm hoping maybe i can gain some different perspectives from you guys on r/personalfinance and choices/paths i can maybe take.

i'm currently 24, graduated with a bfa about 2 years ago and now i am currently in a toxic salary paying job and feel seriously stuck and moderately depressed about my life. by stuck, i mean i feel like my financial situation is significantly preventing me from taking risks, or switching careers, or pursuing my career in a different state.


my salary is 61k/year.  
which comes to about 3,550/month after taxes. 

i am contributing around 5-6% to my 401(k) and the company matches 100% up to 4%.


for monthly bills, i've got:

mortgage: 1358.00.  
hoa: 170.00.  
water: 33.00.  
electric/heat: 130.00.  
internet: 65.00.  
cellphone: 70.00.  
car loan: 274.00.  
car insurance 190.00.  
car gas: 70.00.  
counseling 250.00.  
student loan minimum payment: 400.00.  
parent plus loan: 500.00.  
groceries: 250.00.  

totals to: 3760.00


obviously i'm negative each month, but i am a 3d artist so i usually pick up some side projects to keep me a float. 


i guess i'm frustrated because i feel like i am always working, day and night and at the end of the month i have absolutely no money left. i've gone into a deep depression because i haven't been doing anything fun in my world because i've been working my butt off to pay bills off each month. 

i went into 3d because i was passionate about it and really wanted to make a career out of it, hopefully to make a decent amount of money where i had a little freedom to save up for stuff. but after getting out of college i've come to realization of how savage the industry is and how it would be impossible for me to take a junior/mid level position in the states where most of the jobs are posted.

"i made a budgeting spreadsheet for people who never earned to budget.. hey yall, i usually post on r/povertyfinance  but i wanted to share this here too.


so- what is this budget spreadsheet? why is it different from other budgeting tools?

i grew up poor and with zero sense of what it means to save. on the contrary- when i first started making money i would spend it on things i considered tangible stuff because money felt fleeting. to this day i still do that. i would always try to use different budgeting tools- but the truth is that most of them are set up for people who know how to save. i didn't. i also have adhd and with my brain its very hard to focus too much on the future and i tend to impulse buy if i'm not careful. by making it so that i only have one number i need to focus on i can simplify the process and give myself one thing to focus on while allocating fund to what i need. 

this sheet is set up to be :

1. easy to use
2. focused on a daily budget as opposed to long term
3. a good place to start when you have never  been able to or had to save before

its made to focus on giving you a daily limit to your spending. instead of focusing on where to allocate your money it works on the principal that as long as you remember to not go over your daily spending limit, you will be saving money passively. it gives you a definite number to limit yourself to- allowing you to focus on allocating funds to what they are really needed for.  i know this is much more simple than other sheet- its not the most comlpex or thorough sheet out there, but it is simple. the focus on simplicity is deliberate. i want this to be seen as a place to start. this may not be the best long term budgeting tool (and honestly i would like feedback to make it a better long term tool) but it is a good beginning and introduction to budgeting. 


heres what the sheet looks like(https://imgur.com/a/jgqsfei)


you use it like this

* go in
* make a copy
* change the numbers
* decide what percentage of your income you want to be saving
* budget.

the sheet includes three charts:

* a bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving
* a pie chart to see where your money is distributed
* a daily pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings

i don't work well with a lot of budgets because i have issues imagining the big picture. by giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget i can make sure that on any given day i haven't spent more than im allowed to- and if i so i can see where im borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.



you can find the budget here(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hrkvy7xwakfkdd-cnpr5e3_zwgmd6pp97gctnsn_xj0/copy)

"had surgery apr 5th. surgical assistant was ""medically necessary"" but apparently ""out of network"". $13,700 bill not covered by insurance.. i recently had surgery which apparently required a surgical assistant. throughout the whole surgical process, x-rays, mri, pre op appointments, the hospital confirmed each procedure was covered by my insurance (aetna ppo) before allowing me to schedule an appointment. the surgery was no different. the hospital, surgeon, and anesthesiologist are all in network and covered.

a claim from the surgical assistant was submitted to aetna - $13,700, to which aetna agreed to pay $118 because the surgical assistant was out of network.

i have two issues with this. first, i was under the impression that surgical assistants performing work in an in netowrk facility under the direction of an in network doctor would be covered as in network. second, i had no choice in who the surgical assistant was, didn't even know i needed one until the surgery. since i had no choice in the matter i couldn't tell them to make sure the guy was in network.

what are my options to get this bill covered as in network? i contacted aetna and they said a surgical assistant is covered under their plan, but said they would need to investigate whether or not this specific specialty was on their approved list.

has anyone else had experience with this issue?

thank you.

edit: i have gone through the responses and provided some additional clarification to some of the comments. i appreciate the help and insight people have provided. i will post and update in 3-5 days based on what aetna says about resubmitting the claim. ultimately, this is a frustrating time and it seems like no matter how much prep you do, there is always something that will slip through. i just wish there was more transparency. i could have been more questioning about who was going to be involved, but honestly when i was wheeled into surgery and saw 12 people in there i was surprised.

edit 2: thank you to the people suggesting i go to my company hr representative. she informed me that this exact situation happened with another employee just a few months ago with the same hospital. she was able to get that one resolved and fully covered so she will attempt to do the same with mine.",10
"i'm miserable at my $55k/year job. i have the opportunity to work at a fast growing tech startup for $40k/year. is the switch worth it?. backstory: i was wildly successful at a full time retail commission sales job. i made a switch when one of my clients asked me to work for his energy conservation startup. he falsely marketed the job to me--sold me on an internal sales position and i'm currently doing everything but sales. at the time it seemed like a good idea because i was willing to do anything to get out of my toxic retail job.

the company does not have an internal sales team, he is spending more in lawyer fees than the residual monthly income (witholds commissions from contracted brokers...they sue him), and i cannot see it going anywhere despite his strong-willed forward thinking enthusiasm. note: there are vc investors who see a lot of potential in the company...i don't get it.  i've been in the position for four months--almost fired twice (my boss realized i wasn't closing sales even though my workload was geared toward everything but sales)--saw two employees (bosses he had me train, to be my boss...) come and go because he is impossible to work for. think donald trump temperament with complete inability to reason with people.

here's the catch. he's given me some serious raises in the course of 4 months. i'm currently at $55k/annually...24 years old...with a college degree. but actually no clue wtf the future of this job has in store for me. it could be super successful by some act of god and i'm in a great position to reap the benefits if this does happen. it might happen in a year...it might happen in five...it's hard to tell. at this point i'm bound by the salary.

i have the opportunity to jump ship and work as an sdr for a fast growing tech company. i'd be starting from the bottom with a lot of college grads willing to take a $40k/year salary because it's their first real job and they're enthusiastic as hell to climb the ladder of tech sales.

my boyfriend just moved in with me...brought rent from $1650 to $1100. i am less worried about not affording living expenses and more worried about my future. i can make the lifestyle adjustments...i think. i've gone from $70k/year in retail sales, $55k/year in a startup setting with zero direction and utter chaos solely because of the owner, to considering $40k/year just to start from scratch in an industry that could offer some serious longevity.

the tech position has a lot of upward career trajectory...but this pay cut is hard to wrap my mind around (approx. $15k!!!) . i do not have kids or a mortgage...part of me thinks this is the only chance i'll get to start fresh in a fantastic industry. the other part thinks i'm throwing away the (confusing) hard work i've put in and settling for a common entry level position with little leverage to negotiate. i probably won't see the money i'm making now for a few years.

please advise!!!

edit 1: holy shit thank you for these thoughtful responses. i'm going to get to everyone..but i had a 2 hour window without my boss in the office and now he's here.

edit 3: the reason my rent only decreased by $550/mo after my boyfriend moved in is because i live in a 400 square foot studio and gave him a drawer for his 15 articles of clothing and a corner for his guitar and katana. the spacial distribution is definitely not 50/50 lol. he's inspired by netflix's ""minimalism"" documentary.

"just because you have a budget, doesn't mean you have to spend all of your budget. i noticed some posts on here recently about people feeling guilty about spending money, even though they can afford it and have budgeted for it, since it's hard for them to get out of the ""frugal"" mindset. the general response seemed to be that they should learn to accept that it's okay to spend money on some things—that's what setting a budget is for, after all. 

while this is great advice, i seem to have the opposite problem of these people—i am a bit *too* okay with spending money. i have a set amount of ""fun"" funds that i set aside every paycheck, but because i'm lucky enough to not have anything i really need to save up for, every so often my fun funds will pile up and i'll find myself looking for things to spend my money on—because heck, i've already budgeted for this, so it should be alright, right? but the thing is, i don't really *need* these things, and sometimes don't even want them that much to begin with; i'm literally just looking for an excuse to waste money. it actually got kind of stressful because i wanted to ""make the most"" of my budget but had nowhere to spend it (sounds crazy, right?). a few months ago i spent almost $3000 on an instrument that i've played maybe twice since then. looking back, did i need to spend that $3000? probably not. i could've put that money in the s&p500 or something instead and made $300, and i probably would've gotten more enjoyment out of seeing my portfolio go up $300 than i got from playing that instrument twice.

so i guess learning to be okay with spending money can be a double-edged sword. if you're someone like me who might spring for the next ""upgrade"" just because you can afford it, even though it's more than you need and isn't as good a value, it might be helpful to take a step back and consider whether or not that upgrade is really worth it. since coming to that conclusion, i've cut back my wasteful spending considerably, and the stress of not ""making the most"" of my budget is gone.

have any of you had a similar experience to mine?",10
"hard lesson learned. i backed up into my family member's vehicle this weekend and destroyed my side view mirror (with camera). no damage to the other vehicle. i called a few places to get quotes and they were all around $700-900. since my deductible is $500, i was pretty certain i wouldn't file a claim, but i wanted to see my options. i called my insurance just to see what was covered and what they would offer with the thought that i didn't necessarily have to file the claim. after speaking with them about the accident, they told me that even if i chose not to use the coverage, my premium still might increase since i reported the accident. 

sucks. i should have researched more before i called. just posting this so somebody might not make the same mistake.",10
"just found out that a family ""friend"" has credit cards under my mother's name. what to do?. i went with my mom to the bank to help her get a loan for a home. banker runs her credit, and to my shock, her credit score is deplorable for very obvious reasons: i see credit cards on her report that i didn't know about (my mother doesn't speak english well, and i handle all her finances). i give her an asinine stare, and tell her to spill the beans.

she tells me years ago, a friend of hers, sarah, asked if she could open credit cards under my mother's name for her son, brad. the reason is because sarah, and her son brad, both have horrible credit and topped their credit line limits on all their cards. at the time, brad promised my mother that he'd pay off any new cards that my mom opened for him within a year (that was 6 years ago). my mother, being naive and having a very limited understanding of finances nonchalantly agrees. she opened 2 cards for him, and then he immediately balance transfers his balances on his own cards to my mom's 2 new cards. total debt transferred from brad to my mom was ~10k.

we left the bank. i chastised my mother (in a professional way -- she's still my mother), and i cooled off. i then called brad. for the record, he's a sordid, degenerate, uneducated, pathological liar that clubs, drinks, and does drugs for a living. this isn't a personal attack on him, but just to give you an idea of the type of person i'm dealing with. his social media accounts corroborate the aforementioned.

he said he doesn't use the cards, but just makes minimum payments on them. he provided me the login details; he was telling the truth in regards to not using them and making minimum payments. he then promised me to pay them off within several months -- he lied -- because that was 6 months ago. it's already been 6 years from promise #1, and i'm done being polite. he's fully utilizing my mothers total available credit, has late payments every so often, thus destroying her credit score and ruining her chances of financing a home. 

he already acknowledged that the debt was his (in future text message communication), and also made a promising claim, in writing (sms), to pay off the debt in a certain time frame. i think he has several thousands in assets, but doesn't want to put that toward paying off cc debt -- especially when it's not under ""his name."" what's the best course of action(s)?

tl;dr: a family ""friend"" took advantage of my mother, opened credit cards under her name, then transferred all his debt over to her. mom can't get a home loan because her credit is destroyed. what to do?

edit: i should've mentioned this earlier, the guy drives an audi r8 -- that's a 150k car, but i highly doubt it's his (is their a way to check?). he's a degenerate who hangs around clubbers and drug dealers who live flashy.  i'm sure he's borrowing it from a dealer who resides out of town and owns estate in my area. regardless, someone living a fake and empty lifestyle like this has no moral resolve. nobody with a backbone takes advantage of an old woman who barely speaks english and isn't financially fluent.

update: as suggested by many, i shared this on /r/legaladvice. please see here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ucsjp/just_found_out_that_a_family_friend_has_credit/?st=j6gynviv&sh=89f6406f). would appreciate any lawyers' input.

update 2: apparently, this made the front page on reddit. this is my second post on this site, ever. this is an incredibly generous community that really does give weight to big issues facing normal people. just wanted to say thank you, sincerely, to each and every one of you that has taken time out of their day to put forth their thoughts. i'll keep you updated on this.

update 3: hey reddit family. it's been an absurdly busy few weeks, but there's good news. i've taken the advice of many. i made my mother shutdown the accounts and put a password on them. they're only payable accounts now and cannot be charged. i also became her power of attorney.

i've met with several attorneys, police detectives, and private investigators. they all pretty much said the same thing, i.e., there's really no (short-term) objective of obtaining a judgement and accruing lawyer/pi fees if we cannot collect from brad/sarah. they told me i first had to figure out their assets, then further dig and see if they had any judgements, holds, or liens against them (which may make the collections process much more difficult).

and so i did some digging, and god, was i astonished. the guy and his mother have over 7 cars -- all in their names -- and recently mortgaged a $300k home! i was sick to my stomach to find that out, but at least i know they do have the financial ability to pay. they obviously lied about not having ""good credit"" or the financial means to pay off their old debts.

after approaching the attorneys with this, they said i have everything i need to achieve a judgement and collect (acknowledgement of debt, written agreement to payoff, breach of contract, certified vehicle ownership/title documents from the sos, etc). the attorneys were all sincere in their advice and told me the #1 objective is to collect and avoid additional fees. one attorney was actually nice enough to not charge me and provided me with a template to take to a notary. 


so that's where we stand today. thank you again for the hundreds who shared their thoughts and ideas. i wouldn't have been able to figure all this out without the outpour of support from the reddit community; some who work for audi, others in the repossession industry, and others in the legal and intelligence community that have helped tremendously. i cannot thank you guys enough for your help in sending me in the right direction. so thank you guys, seriously.

i'll keep you guys posted along the way.

"i grew up on food stamps, do ok now but still struggling - what can i do to give my child a better start at life?. i come from generations of poverty. many of my cousins have been to prison, or live in trailers in the same dead-end town we grew up in. no one has a steady job, or a career to speak of. my mom did the best she could as a single parent, always working two or three jobs. i was never given any advice on how to plan for a life, career, college, etc. and so i took some classes but still don't have a degree (in my thirties), neither does my husband. we make an ok living, probably lower-middle class income, but we are still struggling at times.

edit: getting a lot of comments along the lines of 'don't have a kid if you can't afford it.' just to clarify, we can afford it just fine. we don't have 8 kids, we have one. my question is in regards to ""how can i help my child get out of the lower class? middle and upper class people have access to lots of information and resources that i didn't growing up - what are those things? what are the basics i need to start teaching him now?""


edit2:wow, this is getting some attention! here's a little more details:

*we've since moved away from the dead-end town in a bigger city, so no sleazy family influences to deal with

*we picked our current location based on the best public school system in the area, but it's still only rated about a 5/10

*we're good on the basic-basic daily needs, we have a budget, but just can't ever get ahead on getting an emergency fund together

*financial situation is mostly due to me not having a college degree, and my husband finally got his ged last week (hooray!)

edit 5: ok guys, i've tried to keep up, but checking out for now! lots of people have suggested going back to school myself, and it looks like i may be able to sign up for some summer courses. thanks for all the awesome stories of moms and dads who did make a better life for their families through sacrifice and hard work. it's good to know it was worth the effort and was a good lesson too. lots to think about, and a big list to put together!

"gave my two week notice at work and they counter offered with more time and helping me find better job.. i'll start by giving some background on my current job. i have a unique job in a small company of about 150 people. i live two states away from the main office and basically work remotely. i get to make my own schedule for the most part and can take off days whenever i want as long as i can finish the work before the month is over. however, for the majority of the month, i travel to various client sites and i'd say my average mileage each month is about 1,500 miles. i am one of two employees in my entire state so i'm basically isolated and alone all month. i had moved from the main office a year ago where i had friends and more office/ less field work which was amazing. some of these sites are really unsafe and i've been witness to many bad incidents that have left me pretty traumatized. so i've been doing this job for almost 3 years and i'm just feeling done. there's no real way to move up in the company and get out of the trenches without moving back to the main office, which i don't want to move from my current state. i had planned on quitting without any back up job in november as well, though im not sure if i would have followed through. i've always had a job, starting at age 16.

so i started looking for work and 5 months later i get a job interview, a month later (this past monday), i recieved an email seeing if im still interested in the position. i say ""yes"". the new job is a lateral move though. they barely wanted to match my salary i'm making now ($23/hr) which is just above entry level for a college graduate wth my degree. i would get one extra week of paid vacation but i would be doing 9-5 and driving about 45min-1hr commute one way. there wouldn't be flexibility and i would be in a small kiosk but, i would have coworkers to talk to and people to do things with. i don't think there's much growth though within this job as there's only 30 people in the company. im not entirely thrilled about it either. i don't know why but i just don't seem to have excitement for the new job. i tried to request a month to give to my old employer but the new one needs me now. 

problem: 

i gave my two weeks notice yesterday and my current company panicked. most of the time, people give at least a months notice due to the nature of the job and training so im kind of cutting them short. the vp of the company called me and wanted to know why i was so unhappy, i told him, he asked why i didn't tell him i was looking? i've always been told never shoot yourself in the foot before you know you have a job lined up. he asked about the new job and i told him about it, that its linear, that im not all that thrilled, i just can't do this job anymore. 

so he countered by saying, if i stay and give them more time, he will help me find a new job that's probably going to be a step up instead of linear. he said he would help review my resume, write me a letter of recommendation, and use his contacts to find me a good job. if i stay longer. 

i know he's true to his word on this because i've personally seen two of our employees be hired out to our clients through the vp so i know he's not just talking smoke here. 

but now im conflicted. do i stay and do a job that i hate for just a little bit longer (amount if time unknown) if it means i have a chance at getting a real better job? or do i go to the new company, burn the old bridge, and see what happens?

im in a dual income marriage with only a cat, so if this blows up in my face one way or another, we would be fine for over 10 months. my partner is supportive of whatever i decide as well. i've talked to my parents and they both agree this is a hard decision. 

im leaning more towards staying though, because i know this company, i know the vp well, i think he can really help me. i just don't want to do this work anymore which i'd have to. neither of these jobs are my dream job. 

so good people at pf, what should i do?  

thank you for reading.

edit: hi everyone! thank you for all your comments! it seems to be a consensus to stay and see if my vp can help me. im at work now so my responses are slow. im continuing to read through the comments and i'll respond where i can. thank you all for your encouragement and insight. i'll be trying to get a written confirmation from him and tell the new company about my counter offer. you're all the best. thank you!

"has anyone here managed to get any substantial passive income?. youtube and google are kind of useless for this, you just end up with people either humble bragging or trying to sell you something.

"i booked a non-refundable hotel room. when i arrived it was riddled with mold - and i'm quite sensitive (runny nose, itchy eyes). i asked to switch rooms, same issue. i left and stayed elsewhere. the hotel refuses to reimburse me. what can i do?. **edit 3:  i understand that i should not book through a 3rd party - i just learned that a couple months ago! ;)  this was my second hotel that i've ever booked (i don't book hotels often) and these 3rd party sites are heavily advertised.  i've learned my lesson.  i get it!**

*edit:  i am calling my credit card company now.  thank you all for chiming in - i appreciate it.  i've also contacted the health services authority for the region that the hotel is in.*

*edit 2:  the hotel was* **travelodge** *- parent company is* **wyndham**.  *i booked through expedia.*

*i asked: ""does expedia have no built in protections for customers if the rooms are filthy or not as described/advertised?""*

*their response: ""expedia is subject to the rules and restrictions of the vendors whose services we sell. we act only as an agent for their product and do not have the authority to override or to change their policies.""*

*needless to say i won't be using expedia or any other 3rd party again.  the true problem however was travelodge and wyndham.*



the girl at the front desk told me that the building was just old and all rooms would likely have the mold.  it looked more like neglect - they just didn't bother to clean the windows, vents, and ac / heating unit for a long time.

i've been in contact with the hotel's parent company for 2 months - they're offering a half refund.  the hotel's manager will not return my calls and will not authorize a refund.

would it be appropriate to try to cancel this charge on my credit card since the hotel will not communicate with me?",10
"is there an app or website where i can enter products i buy all the time and be alerted when they go on sale?. i've tried some websites that are out there like krazy koupon lady and google shopping and been disappointed. it's 2017, do i really need to haunt 15 stores in person weekly to find out when grocery, pharmacy, and cleaning products are on sale? i don't buy sunday paper (long story, and it doesn't have every store's circular anyway) and reading pdf circulars is pretty difficult. a circular is just a way to get you to buy stuff you weren't planning on, anyway! i know what i want, please tell me when it's on sale so i can stock up. i am aware there are coupon apps but most coupons are for promoting premium priced items i don't buy and generally the savings is much less than a real sale. however if there is a coupon app that alerts you when local stores have a sale on specific items i would be down for that.

"i feel like my job is becoming less worth it each year. here is the problem i'm having with my job. i like working here, but every year my responsibility level goes up and up. 5 years ago when i started, the job was busy but pretty good. however, now i'm the lead on projects, with people working under me, interfacing with customers, travelling internationally, solving problems on the floor, and reporting directly to senior management. the stress and the work have really ramped up in intensity with each passing year. the more senior you get, the worse it gets.

meanwhile, our compensation increases by 4-4.5% annually depending on a number of factors. it is always within this range until it caps after you reach the ceiling for the role. with inflation being around 2% annually, the real growth in compensation is about 2-2.5% annually. after 5 years, i am making about 23% more than my starting salary.

it really doesn't feel worth it anymore. during my last annual review i tried to ask for a larger increase, but was told that it simply doesn't happen. i have actually been thinking about leaving. if i can't find a higher paying role, would it be a reasonable thing to do to look for a lesser paying role with less stress and responsibility?

"cancelled la fitness - they keep charging me. i hope this is in the right place.

&#x200b;

i spoke with an employee via phone at my local la fitness about cancelling my membership 4 months ago.  i am a month to month member and she told me i could cancel via email and to send it to a specific manager in xx department.  i did so and i believed i have cancelled.  i got a new credit card number due to fraud and now i'm getting calls everyday from la fitness saying i've missed my payment.  6 days in a row i'm getting these calls.  the first time i spoke to a young lady and explained what i had done, how i followed instructions and cancelled the account via email and she acknowledged that was in the notes and she would have a manager call me to reimburse for the last 3 months (yes, they continued to charge me) and to confirm my cancellation.  problem is everyday they call back (from a different phone number), it's a different person, with the same story ... ""you've missed a payment, would you like to update your card"" and i have to explain and they apologize and say the manager should call the next day, except ....

"a realtor is selling my house without my permission, what should i do?. we bought it 2 years ago and found out about it being sold on the internet only a few hours ago. we don't know how long the ad has been up but it's not on the site of the realtor we bought it from... any advice?

**edit: ok... time to disappoint a lot of people.**

first of all, thank you to everyone here for the overwhelming response we had. a lot of great and precious advice.

i have to clarify a few things as well:

- this isn't happening in the us. sorry. sorry. i'm sorry. when i posted this on here i didn't realize that it was based in the us, we wanted as much advice as possible. all the time you spent writing advice wasn't wasted though, because it seems mostly applicable here too; the terminology is just different.
- as a few of you pointed out, no one is ""selling"" my house without my permission. it's just a listing. still worrying but not as much as the title implies i guess.
- i am not behind the ""scam"" (if this turns out to be one). i'm not a realtor and i don't think posting about it on reddit would be the greatest idea.

now for the update part: from what i've read across the 250 or so comments in my inbox (haven't gone through all the replies yet), this could be one of 3 things (from less likely to most likely):

- an actual scam. someone is trying to forge documents to gain ownership of the house or something. i haven't really understood the whole process of this one but it's still possible.
- a bait & switch listing, used to get interested people to call to visit the house. then the realtor tells them it's not available right now but ""here are some other houses we can take a look at"". we think this one is what is actually happening. they might be taking (or keeping) old ads on their website just to have a good quantity of them so people come.
- an error. honestly the most likely. the pictures are from 2 years ago when we bought the house. the house is not currently for sale anymore and someone could have forgotten to take the ad down. the price is the same as when we bought it too. 

all in all, this is probably just a fun ride and we're not likely to lose our house that way (thanks for pointing that out, it's reassuring).

we will call the realtor as potential buyers, saying we're interested and want to visit the (our) house. if they remove the ad it was just a mistake. if they answer offering to take a look at other houses we will send a formal letter asking to remove the listing. same thing if we don't get an answer.

either way, i will keep this post updated.

ps. i realized that this should have been posted on r/legaladvice instead. i don't think i can just move the whole thing now but if the mods want to remove it because it breaks the rules i'm ok with that..

thanks again for all the replies, advice and to everyone who shared their experience! see ya in ""edit 2"" probably

"i'm 18 and about to earn $73,000 a year.. i recently got the opportunity to work on an oil and gas rig and if everything goes to plan in the next week i should have the job. it is a 2 week on 2 week off job so i can't really go to uni, nor do i want to. i want to go to film school but i'm not sure i can since i will be flying out to a rig for 2 weeks at a time. for now i am putting that on hold but still doing some little projects on my time off. my question is; what should i do with the money since i am so young, don't plan on going to uni, and live at home?

"why you might consider a trade over college (one real-world perspective). my husband and i are in our early thirties.  neither of us completed high school; we both have geds.  we both come from very financially and emotionally unstable backgrounds.  we have a lot of reasons/excuses to fail in life.  and we did, for a while.

then we found plumbing.  my husband went through his apprenticeship first while i financially held down the fort (driving 18 wheelers, which is a great short term way to earn a good amount of money).  he still made between $12-15/hr throughout his two year apprenticeship, which is a lot better than no dollars per hour, and now he is paid commission and nets about $60/k year.  that is low for this company and he will make more as he gains confidence and experience.

i have now decided to follow in his footsteps and got lucky with a $15/hr position as a completely green apprentice.  as a female, it was very hard to break in with no previous labor experience, but i found a female-owned company that gave me a shot.  i'm 3 months in, 21 to go for my tradesman license.

so, for now, we have a combined net income of about $85k/year, and no debt of any kind.  within two years, that income should rise to $120-$150k very realistically.  more is entirely possible as half the plumbers at the company we both currently work for bring home $90k or more.  also, this is for service (residential) plumbing, not commercial or union.  you can make great money in both of those arenas as well (especially union if you're in a good state for it).

i think that most states do not have a tradesman license, so in that case, your apprenticeship would be 4 years to get your journeyman.  i still think it would be well worth it for a lot of people.  

i just thought i would make a post giving some people a first-hand, real world example of making it without a college degree or any student loan debt.  and the job prospects are fantastic.  there are no plumbers in my city that look for a job for more than a few days... and they have multiple offers to choose from.  the fact is that there are not enough plumbers to go around, and that is true of a lot of trades.  the job growth in plumbing over the next 20 years is double the national average.

unless you are disabled, there are no excuses.  and yes, ladies, you can do it, too.  i do.  i'm 5'1"" and weigh 118 lbs and i do it.  i have trouble helping lift water heaters into and out of attics, and the company tries to keep me off water heaters when possible, but i still do it.  yes, it will be harder.  but no one ever got anywhere by whining about fairness or difficulty.

"our emergency fund: a love story. from the time i was old enough to understand what money was my mom drove two things into my head:

1. always live below your means
2. always have a rainy day fund

i took it to heart, but this month was the first time i really learned just how important those lessons were. 

my husband and i are in the process of buying our first house. we are doing it ""old school"" with conventional, 20% down. we have been saving for years and after some search found the perfect place at about half the cost of what the bank told us we could afford. it fits our needs and is well within the budget we set for ourselves. 20% down plus closing and general moving expenses means we had to save a lot of cash, and we insisted we have that money available on top of our standard 6-month emergency fund. 

everything was sunshine and rainbows until 12 days before closing. we file our taxes and due to a change in our financial situation wind up owing the irs $1800. great, pay it from the emergency fund and be done with it. 12 hours later, we learn there was an unexpected death in the family. we live 900 miles away, so that means a last second trip. $1000 in suits/dresses, 3 days off work, travel expenses tbd. but that is okay, because we have an emergency fund. all told it adds up to about $4000 we weren't planning on having to spend this month. 

without our emergency fund, we would have had to skip a funeral for a loved one, setup payment plans with the irs, or worse, had to delay the purchase of our home. instead we will buckle down on our spending for the next few months and recoup what spent from our ""rainy day"" fund. when it rains, it pours. do yourself a favor and save yourself some stress, have an emergency fund.


**edit:** a lot of people seem to have an issue with spending ~$1k on clothing. well, here is a breakdown:

$100 - a new, quality dress for me that fit off the rack, is appropriate for a funeral and a host of other functions. i love it. it will last for years.

$800 - two (buy one get one free deal) designer suits, two dress shirts (bogo), two ties (bogo), and rush tailoring on one of the suits for my husband. was it expensive? yes, but they will fit him a whole lot better than the $150 h&m alternative and will also last for years. 

$100 - a large black umbrella, a new belt, a shoe shine kit, other small necessaries  

we had been planning to get him a new suit for a while anyway, now he has two. for every wedding, funeral, cocktail party or work event we go to for the next several years we are set. saving and being frugal matters, i obviously know and care about that. spending $1000 to not look like a schlub at a funeral and to have our formal clothing needs satisfied for several years was worth it to us.

"is amway just another pyramid scheme? my friend recently got excited over it and wants me in it. hi,  
i have a friend that i met at uni and we're very close (met him on my first day which was last year this time).   just yesterday he was approached through a networking website and attended a meeting for a company named ""amway"".   i did a bit of research and what i've gathered, it's another pyramid scheme.   but how? aren't they illegal?   he literally spilt out everything they said in the meeting about ""investing in products, marketing it and gaining huge profits eventually"", and seemed genuinely excited. he then wants to bring me in as a mentee, because he thinks i'll really like it.   i don't believe he would try to bring me in, if he knew it was something along the lines of a pyramid scheme, (since we're close mates and all).   so what does reddit think of amway?   is it an obvious choice to run?  
edit: thanks for the answers everyone!   unfortunately, we had a long debate today about it and he is definitely set. even after i talked about the pyramid scheme esque facts and everything else you guys said. i'm still going to be his friend but i'm definitely not bought. he is very stubborn and wants me to read a book by kiyosaki... he also mentioned that they sell products at a price lower than retail price, contrary to what other posters said. can anyone confirm?  
mind you guys, i am definitely not going to consider joining amway. i might be beating a dead horse but i'm going to still continue to convince my friend to run.

"given a promotion... and less money?. i could really use reddit's advice this morning...

i started a new job at the beginning of september. i was brought on at a base salary of $70k - with promises of commissions. they estimated my annual compensation to be about $105k but said that it had the potential to go up to around $130k.

at the beginning of november, a man in a similar (but more senior) role turned in his notice. he's a director level, while i'm at a manager level. i was congratulated by my boss for this unexpected promotion and assured that this was a very good move for me and that i'd be making ""a lot more money"". he even referred to it as life changing. i asked if my job title would be changing and he said no.

it took him a few weeks to put my comp plan together. yesterday, he called me in and gave me rave reviews of my performance so far (to be fair, i've mostly been in training) and highlighted some goals for 2020. and then he discussed my exciting new comp plan...

he's cutting my base salary to $60k (which is supposedly what the director's base salary was). and estimating my total compensation to be $104k.  

he acted absolutely flabbergasted that i wasn't excited about it. i told him it was less than he had estimated my previous role - and he said that he had re-ran the math and i would have never gotten close to that in commissions, he had originally run the math based on outdated data. he said that these commissions are basically guaranteed, as in this role, i'll be getting commission based on overall company performance rather than on just my own work. 

i asked him for a night to think about it - and he told me yes, but that it wouldn't change anything. and if i wasn't happy with that, that we could shake hands and go our separate ways. 

i don't know what to do. does anyone have any suggestions? i can't afford to be jobless, but man - this feels like a bait and switch.

update:
i took the director out for drinks. oh boy. apparently he's leaving because they cut his commission by 70% - and told him his new annual compensation estimate was exactly what they've told me mine would be. yikes. i truly appreciate all of the advice and help! it's encouraging when others validate what you're feeling & fearing.",10
"i've simulated and plotted the entire s&p since 1871: how you'd make out for every possible 40-year period if you buy and hold. (yes, this includes inflation and re-invested dividends). i submitted this to /r/dataisbeautiful some time last week(https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4q9iwa/40_years_of_investing_returns_in_the_sp500_with/) and it got some traction, so i wanted to post it here but with a more in-depth writeup.

note that this data is from robert shiller's work. an up-to-date repository is kept at this link(https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500/tree/master/data). up next, i'll probably find some bond data and see if i can simulate a three-fund portfolio or something. but for now, enjoy some visuals based around the stock market:

**image gallery:**

* main image(https://i.redd.it/nn43lzu4d16x.png)
* after 145 years (all data)(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/investing/master/returns.png)

* animated(https://github.com/zonination/investing/blob/master/readme.md#other-visualizations)

the plots above were generated based on past returns in the s&p. so at year 1, we take every point on the s&p curve, look at every point on the s&p that's one year ahead, add in dividends and subtract inflation, and record all points as a relative gain or loss for year 1. then we do the same thing for year 2. then year 3. and so on, ad nauseum. the program took a couple hours to finish crunching all the numbers.

in short, for the plots above: **if you invest for x years, you have a distribution of y possible returns**, based on previous history.

some of the worst market downturns are also represented here, like the great depression(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_depression), the 1970s recession(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%e2%80%9374_stock_market_crash), black monday(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_monday_(1987\)), the dot-com bubble(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dot-com_bubble), the 2008 financial crisis(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_crisis_of_2007%e2%80%9308). but note how they completely recover to turn a profit after some more time in the market. here's the list of years you can invest, and still be down. take note that **some of these years cover the same eras**:

* **down after 10 years** (11.8% chance historically)**:** 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1929 1930 1936 1937 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1998 1999 2000 2001
* **down after 15 years** (4.73% chance historically)**:** 1905 1906 1907 1929 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969
* **down after 20 years** (0.0664% chance historically)**:** 1901
* **down after 25 years** (0% chance historically)**:** *none*

---

**disclaimer:**

note that this stock market simulation assumes a portfolio that is invested in 100% us stocks. while a lot of the results show that 100% stocks can generate an impressive return, **this is not an ideal portfolio.**

**a portfolio should be diversified(https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/three-fund_portfolio)** with a good mix of us stocks, international stocks, and bonds. this diversification helps to hedge against market swings, and will help the investor to optimize returns on their investment with lower risk than this visual demonstrates. this is especially true closer to retirement age.

in addition to this, this curve only looks at **one lump sum** of initial investing. a typical investor will not have the capital to employ a single lump sum as a basis for a long-term investment, and will instead rely on *dollar cost averaging*, where cash is deposited across multiple years (which helps to smooth out the curve as well).

"purchasing renter's insurance and no one will let me read the contract before signing it.. i'm buying renter's insurance for the first time because my new building requires it. i'm trying to be a responsible shopper by getting a few quotes, comparing them, and then reading the contract before i agree to it. this is how i've always been taught to make big decisions like this.

but apparently that's not how the rental insurance world works. i've talked to three companies now (state farm, allstate, and geico), and they've all told me they will not send me the contract before i make payment. i called the dc department of insurance, securities, and banking, and bafflingly, this is a perfectly legal practice.

i spoke to an understanding man at geico who explained that, at least for them, they were reselling the insurance of one of their partners, and they are contractually obligated not to release the contract before someone purchases insurance. he told me this is standard practice in the renter's insurance world and that no company wanted their contracts (called an ho-4) released prior to payment. he sent me an example of what an ho-4 typically looked like that he found online (here(https://www.uuinsurance.com/z_agent_pdf_forms/policy%20jackets/ho4%20renters.pdf)), but couldn't find the contract i would actually be agreeing to (assurant's march 2017 rental contract).

so here are my questions, from most to least pressing:

* does anyone have a copy of assurant's march 2017 renter's insurance contract for the district of columbia?
* is there a good source online for me to find more of these contracts?
* does anyone know if state farm and allstate are similarly resellers of insurance?
* if they are resellers, do you know who they would source a dc rental policy from?
* how can i get copies of these contracts before i agree to them?
* why does this business work this way?",10
"my credit card number was hijacked and used at smoothie king for $200. what's the logic in using a stolen card number at a smoothie king?. my credit card company notified me immediately and asked if it was an authorized transaction. they promptly canceled the card. i still have the card in my possession so i'm not even sure how they got it to process. maybe they picked up the number from an online transaction or restaurant and then fabricated a fake with a strip instead of the chip? also, why a smoothie king and what did they buy for $200?!? maybe they were trying for gift cards or one of those tubs of protein and then possibly a cash return?? i'm only guessing....i'm confused by their actions....",10
"paid off 48k in student debt in one year, just made last payment.. hi everyone,

long time lurker and was 48k in student debt last december. made a commitment last year to get out of debt. first, off i went the opposite direction and took a $3,500 digital marketing course. that allowed me though to land a higher paying job as a marketing manager for a professional services firm. 

i already had an emergency fund of 5k and my new job didn't let us get in the 401k plan until a year in (since has been changed). i put everything i made into my loans, besides rent & utility, cheap food and didn't buy anything like new clothes or luxury items. i then got a gig doing private security at events like pax east, comic con, apple and at hospitals that paid any where from $20-30hr. would do these sporadically for anywhere from 10-40 extra hrs a week and huck it am my loans. i also signed up for rover.com and took care of about 40 different types of dogs. 

the final push is when i started driving uber. i work in boston right next to a college so after work it would often be surging and i'd drive for hours after work. i got addicted and would try to bring in an extra $500-800 week driving. lots of caffeine and not going out on weekends. kept track of mileage, driving expenses and expected taxes. i also made and extra $1600 referring four drivers

i was making quick headway, but was getting really burnt out. i would occasionally take a weekend off to recharge and then get back at it i would fantasize about hitting a scratch ticket for the last 10k or a gift from a long lost relative. then fate intervened. at my old job we had a pension program i never paid attention to because they said it was going away. well one day i get a call from my  old cfo the plan was frozen and i was being paid out a little over 10k. i could either take it as cash and pay 3k in taxes & fines, or roll it over. i was extremely tempted to take it and run, but after talking to my cpa coworkers, decided to suck it up and roll it over into an ira at wealthfront. 

i drove a shit ton of uber the last two months, put my whole work bonus and all my rover funds towards the last 10k. i was down to 3k last night and used 3gs from my emergency fund to finish it off. it was a very long process, but i'm glad i'm done. now have to replenish the emergency fund and save up for taxes (saved a bunch, but got greedy towards the end putting it all at the loan). 

i'm done and am looking forward to having more free time for fun, learning more skills to get a better job and getting back into fitness. i also made my first post loans splurge purchase..new retro jordan 9's..don't know why i wanted them, but i did. 😎

edit: thank you to everyone for their kind words. i'm done replying for a while, please search the thread if you have questions, i think i answered most of them somewhere. have a great day and let's go pats!",10
"minimum wage just raised to $14, how can i bring up a relevent raise to my pay?. the wordings a bit rough, but essentially minimum wage just went from $11.40 to $14 (in ontario, canada). i have a job as an analyst in a lab, and my starting pay was $14 (before the wage went up). after 3 months, it was automatically going to be re-negotiated to $14.50 (which will be sometime this month), but now i'm wondering if i can try for something that reflects the current minimum.

 how can i go about bringing this up to my boss? how would i even word it, or argue for it? 

edit: hey everyone! thank you so much for sharing your advice! i can't believe this exploaded the way it did, but i honestly appreciate each and every comment. to do a mini update, here's my plan of action : **nothing!**

not in a bad sense however! i recognize this is in inopportune time for such a talk, and that my value as a worker does not necessarily reflect upon what others around me make. rather, its a reflection of what i bring to the table, and should be compensated accordingly. now, this beind said, staying in this job isn't my long term goals. i'll let the dust settle, garner as much experiance as i can in this field, and polish up the ol'resume to start finding a career that suits my needs and pays me the good monies.

 its known where i work that you have to fight for every cent, which isn't really my forte, nor do i wish to do so. i'll work my way up to the next level of analyst (intermediate requires 2-3 years exp), and cast my net out in search of greener lands (heres looking at you big pharma), but damn if i won't be sending out resumes all the while. 

again, thank you all for the advice! i really appreciate it, and wish y'all a happy new year! please accept a photo of my cat, her ladyship, nori, as an appeasment for the fact that i can't get around to replying to everyone : https://imgur.com/gallery/8wh4h",10
"how do you ever retire at 65 and live to 95 given the power of inflation?. i recently created a retirement spreadsheet using excel and am having a hard time understanding how, given the power of inflation, you could ever retire with relative certainty that'd you'd be ok in the long run. 

suppose you retire at age 65 with optimistically $1.5 million in savings. suppose that generates 5% per year in interest income that you plan to live on = $75k/yr. suppose you pay 30% total income tax on that (fed/state) leaving you with ~$50k/yr or roughly $4,000/mo. clearly today $4,000/mo is plenty to live on comfortably.

but ~30 years from now (i am 36), assuming 3.2% annual inflation, $4,000/mo is worth only about $1,500 in today's dollars. still maybe ok if you live frugally; maybe have a place to live for free at that point (assuming you didn't need your home equity to get to the original $1.5m nest egg). 

but the thing that really has me scratching my head is what if you live to be 95? that $4k/mo is now worth only ~$600/mo. that's tough to live on. and the thing that is even harder for me to understand is how much money it would take to make a material difference — suppose you double the $1.5m nest egg to $3.0m. by 95, that is still only giving you ~$1,200/mo in today's dollars worth of purchasing power?

clearly you might have additional income — ssi and/or work pension etc. but for the sake of simplicity, assume you don't have those additional sources (because 1.5m as a nest egg is a stretch as is, so in coming up with the above numbers, i already shifted them to assume some of that original $4k/mo includes those sources).

how does one responsibly plan to live into deep old age (the universe willing) given the power of inflation? once you stop working and start living on interest income, your dollars seem to devalue rapidly. is the only solution kids/other family support by ppl working who make salaries inflated to 60-years-from-now levels? or just enjoy the first 10-15 years of retirement while your money is still competitive? is the advice on so many finance websites to aim for 1m to 1.5m in retirement savings dated (keyed to today's dollars or even 30 years from now dollars, rather than 40/50/60 years from now dollars)? or the advice that you should save x times your current salary to sustain x quality of life somewhat incomprehensible, since retirement is not a static situation, but rather a dynamic one in which x quality of life takes increasingly more income to sustain every year?

i'd really appreciate any help with reorienting my thinking about this if possible. i thought the retirement spreadsheet drafting process would make me feel more secure, and instead i feel less secure.

tl;dr - draft retirement spreadsheet has me confused as to how one can ever reasonably expect to live 30 years post-retirement on interest income alone without many millions in savings given the power of inflation. please help :)

edit: wow, thank you all so much for the incredible response and wealth of information. to summarize major takeaways: 1) the biggest mistake i made was to assume that i would live entirely off interest income in retirement; rather, most people seem to draw down principal and a 4% draw is very likely to last 30 years, a 3% draw almost certainly will (see trinity study and concept of ""safe withdrawal rate""). 2) i made many assumptions that are too pessimistic: a) tax rate is likely to be something closer to 20%, b) real return (inflation adjusted) is likely to be 3-5% annually, in part because c) 3.2% is likely too high an estimate of inflation (100-year historic average does not take into account modern monetary policy). 3) if possible, try not to assume the equity in your home will become part of the nest egg; great if you can live in the home to reduce housing expenses in retirement. 4) for many, retirement at 65 may be optimistic given increasing life expectancies — consider staying engaged even in part-time work you enjoy beyond that. 5) expenses do tend to go down in retirement, though this may be non-linear (early active years, more sedentary mid-retirement, increased care costs in late retirement). 6) consider ""bond tent"" or similar approach to asset allocation near the retirement age. since poor stock market returns near retirement can cause you to dip into principal in a way that dramatically alters performance throughout retirement, it is a good idea to shift some of your portfolio to bonds near retirement age (see ""sequence of returns"" concept). 7) if an appealing option, consider jurisdictional arbitrage — i.e., make money in a place where wages/income are relatively high and then retire to a place where cost of living is relatively low (tl;dr - work in the us and retire to mexico/south america/southeast asia). 8) lastly, wherever you are on the path to retirement, proceed in the face of inherent uncertainty (even the corrected assumptions above about swrs, future tax rates, real returns, and inflation are not certain), balancing as best you can the ability to hedge risk and plan for the future while also enjoying today. thank you all — spreadsheet updated!",10

"is there a such thing as personal finance for poor people?. just curiously, all the pf books and informaiton out there seems to be geared toward middle class and upper middle class people. is there anything out there that is geared toward actually helping someone who is poor and in a broken home (no support) to become stable?

it would cover the same principals but use examples more relvant to poor people, for instance ""assume you have $500 to put down on a car, a decent job, but no support if your car breaks down... should you buy use or new?"" i figure the bulk of the lessons would be about pf in the light of risk management.",10

"""hidden"" costs of buying a home and how to prepare for them.. i see a lot of people talking about the ""hidden"" expenses of buying a home.  while many things in life are uncertain, you can still plan for the most common scenarios.  i'll be listing big ticket items below that a lot of people don't budget for, the average cost, and the average life expectancy.  a house is likely the most expensive purchase you will ever make so you want to do your research before hand.  two things to note before i begin:

1. unexpected things can happen no matter how well you plan.  my 17 year old tree got knocked down during a windstorm 2 weeks after i bought my house.  my fence was fairly new and should have had a decade left in it, but trees are bigger than fences.  as mr. gump once said, ""shit happens.""

2. these prices all vary massively.  i aggregated averages from various sites, but just because the median price is 7500 doesn't mean you won't be paying between 2k and 30k.  i'll explain what to look for cost wise for each item, but remember that every scenario is unique so you need to do research for your specific circumstance.  now let's get started.

**roof**

this is the most expensive one for most people.  the average cost of a roof is $7500 dollars.  the average life expectancy is 20 years.  this varies greatly based on the material it is made out of, the size, and the climate you are in.  the best way to get the most out of your roof is to keep it clean of things like moss build-up.  i bought a 17 year old home.  if the roof was the original i'd be looking at a huge cost in the not so distant future.  luckily mine was almost brand new, which is a sigh of relief for any homeowner.

**furnace**

the average cost of a furnace is $3000 dollars.  the average life expectancy is 18 years.  this varies based on the brand you have and the climate you are in.  the best way to get the most out of your furnace is to change filters on time and not use it when it's not needed.  unlike my roof, my furnace was an original with the house.  knowing it was on it's last years of life i upped my emergency fund by a few thousand dollars for when the sucker died.  (rip 2016, made it 21 years!)

**central air**

the average cost of a central air unit is $4000 dollars.  the average life expectancy is 18 years.  this varies based on the brand you have, the size, and the climate you are in.  someone buying a unit for a 1200sq foot home in maine is naturally going to spend less than someone buying for a 2500 sq foot home in arizona.  (assuming people in maine even have them?)  the best way to get the most out of your ac is to not use it when it's not needed.  i had same story with ac unit as furnace.  they died about 6 months apart, but since i'd been planning for that for a few years it wasn't too devastating of a hit to me.

**wood fence**

the average cost of a wooden fence is $25 dollars per sq ft.  the average life expectancy is 12 years.  this quite a bit based on the material you use and the climate.  also if you don't like wood the cost for other materials will change a lot.  this is the first item on the list that i will say you can save money on by doing the labor yourself.  without expertise you don't want to mess with building a roof or installing an ac or furnace.  fences aren't that bad though if you're relatively handy and you can cut the cost on half.

**washer/dryer**

the average cost of a washers and dryers is $500 dollars each.  the average life expectancy is 10 years.  this varies based on the brand and size.  if you want a behemoth washer that is also basically a computer you'll be paying a lot more than a normal sized with with 2 knobs on it for heat and time.  make sure to clear the damn lint trap for your dryer!

**fridge**

the average cost of a refrigerator is $1100 dollars.  the average life expectancy is 14 years.  this varies based on the brand and size.  barring something obvious like leaving it open for 16 weeks in a row there isn't really a way to keep it alive longer.  just make sure you go catch it if it's running.

**deck repair**

the average cost of deck repair is $1500.  the average life expectancy is 15 years.  this varies based on the size of the deck and the extent of repairs needed.  this is also one that you can save a lot of money if you do it yourself.  as for a new deck... you'll have to price that out yourself because it has a wider range than pretty much any of the other items based on size and materials.

**sprinkler system**

the average cost of a new sprinkler system is $3000.  the average life expectancy is 15 years if you don't go cheapo.  this varies based on the size of the yard, climate, and how many installations you want.  repairs to a system can be 100-1000 dollars based on what is damage and where.

**hot water heater**

last item!  the average cost of a hot water heater is $1500 dollars.  the average life expectancy is 10 years.  this varies based on the brand and size.  a good way to expand the life of a hot water heater is to not drive your car into it like my cousin once did.  (he did it to his own, not mine thankfully.)

**conclusion**

so, these are all the items my realtor ran through with me.  hope it helps at least someone out there!

in the 8 years i've been here i've had expected replacements to hot water, ac, furnace, washer, and dryer.  i've had unexpected replacements to the fence.  everything else is still within it's normal life span so this list has been great for me minus one stupid wind storm.",10

"timeshare ownership is never a good financial idea.. i see on reddit a some comments about how owning timeshares ""can be a good deal"" and thought it was prudent to point out this is just not true in any evidence i could find. they are a really predatory and deceptive business whether resale or points based and especially when bought from the developer. let's go through the options if you **own** a timeshare:

* you buy from a developer/direct -

they immediately decrease in value if bought from the developer, sometimes to literal worthlessness or even negative value. every. single. timeshare. decreases. i don't care if it's disney vacation club or whatever the salesperson told you. you buy it from the developer and you just wasted tens of thousands of dollars. check ebay if you don't believe me or literally any of the resale sites. you just lost thousands of dollars. find a single one that has increased in value vs inflation, post the link and i'll buy the first person gold. even dvc which is considered the most valuable timeshare currency sells for under initial purchase value when accounting for inflation.

* you buy/gifted from a reseller/family member -

let's say you get it for literally zero dollars on ebay. pretty sweet right, free vacation? wrong. maintenance fees will be very expensive. at least 500-800$ yearly. so you are paying 500-800 a year, to hopefully go on vacation to the same place at the same time (if the word ""points"" just jumped into your brain, go to the next paragraph).  this may be a discount of 0%-50%. so this is the one thing i will conceded this may provide you with a *small* discount. so a small discount to have a liability and complete lack of flexibility in a vacation is a terrible financial tradeoff. people that post that ""the same room/condo would be 5k that week!"" are always quoting the developers ""stated rate"" which is not market at all and basically made up. give me an exact example if you think i'm wrong along with screen shot of your maintenance fees and again, gold to the first person.

* ""but 16semesters, i get points! i have plenty of flexibility""

points are garbage. garbage. they oftentimes include an additional fee to use a different resort. no matter what the salesperson told you, there *are* byzantine rules on dates, switching out, etc. they are restrictive and expire after *at most* 3 years. they sell for fractions of their ""value"" on resale sites. why would points be selling for so little on the resale market if they are such good deals? wouldn't it be prudent to just buy the points at a significant discount and use those instead? let me know your company your timeshare is through and i can promise i'll find points well below ""retail"".

a lot of people also get second hand information on these things from family members that may be inaccurate or outdated so i'd caution passing off ""well my aunt only pays x"" unless you've seen some proof.  it's okay if you've been scam by a timeshare or someone in your family has. i've been scammed on other scams before, it doesn't make you stupid. i write this post on the personal finance subreddit so that people can be informed moving forward. if anyone has disagreements or something i missed let me know.",10

i worked full time remotely at a company for 5 years. my wife is a stay home mom and we have two kids (a 2 year old, and a 6 month old). in the final two months of my employment, i got fewer and fewer projects to work on. in april, my boss emailed and told me they were going to change my full time employment to part time, dropping me from 40 hours to 8 hours or less per week, and that i will also lose all of my benefits. he said they didn't have have enough projects to keep me busy. i can't afford to lose my hours and medical benefits (it is what covers my family!), so i emailed my boss and pointed it out to him that cutting my hours from 40 hours to 8 hour or less is a lay off. that i would rather he just laid me off so i can start looking for a new job. he agreed and told me he is going to process my lay off per my request. 

i applied for unemployment and during the phone interview for unemployment eligibility, the interviewer told me my boss told them that i quit my job because i was not satisfied with the work. i told them that was not true as i was laid off. the interviewer told me they were going to investigate. today i called the edd office to follow up, and they told me my claim was denied and that i would a denial letter within a week. 

i have been applying for jobs and have couple interviews lined up. i also have enough emergency funds to cover for expenses while i'm looking. but i do need the unemployment money in case i can't find a job in time.

do i have a case for an appeal?

edit: yes, i have all of the emails copies. is email evidence enough to proof my case or i should hire a lawyer?

edit 2: wow, more than 7000 upvotes!! thank you all! didn't expect this will get so many attentions. 
let me answer some of the questions here:
1. i forwarded the work emails to my personal email account before they took over my work email.
2. i pointed out to them that what they were doing (cutting my hours from 40 to 8) is consider a lay off and i rather they just do it. i didn't mentioned i am going to look for a new job.

"federal workers, was your back-pay short?. my wife is a federal employee who wasn't payed during the shutdown. yesterday she got a direct deposit for one missed paycheck and another is pending for tomorrow. each payment is $484 less than her normal pay. she's going to ask about it today, but i was wondering if it happened to anyone else.

"employer keeps changing pay/benefits during the hiring process? is this a red flag? how to do i respond?. orginally i was quoted a salary of 97k. i accepted. later, in an email, i was told that was a mistake and that my actual salary would be around 75k. they said ""i hope this doesnt impact your decision to work for us"". 

i told them it did impact my decision. i told them this was my dream job but that i have offers for up 120k so i am definitely not accepting 75k.  finally after much negotiation, we settled on a salary of $94k and $10k per year student loan repayment (for up to 60k for 6 years). 

now, months later, i am filling out the loan repayment paper work and the hr lady emails me again saying they made a mistake and that after reivenstigation of policies the student loan repayment is only going to be a total of 10k over 3 years. and the full 60k will not be reached until 8 years. 

how should i respond to the email if this is not okay with me? are all these changes red flags? should i pick a different place to work? ",10

"the irs says i owe them $20000.00. what do i do?. so i have been getting mail recently from the irs claiming that i owe the federal government almost $20,000.00 from the 2014 tax year. 

there's just one problem with that though: i was in high school in 2014, and i made less than $2000 total that year. 

i think they may have gotten me confused with my dad who has the same name as me. my dad and i don't talk anymore, but i know that he hasn't done his taxes in about four or five years. 

i have tried calling the irs, but they were very unhelpful. saying that i needed my dads tax information to verify that the balance is his..... but he has no tax information.  

what should i do? is there an in person office i can do in to to state my case? this really is inconvenient as it is a mistake on their part, but now i am having to do the work to clean it up. ",10
"sallie mae has raised my interest rate to a ludicrous rate and are not informing me why and are straight up ignoring my questions. i need advice on how to battle this or some good loan consolidation options.. i'll keep this short and sweet (or bitter rather).

as the title states, sallie mae recently raised my interest rate to 10.75%, my loan amount is 28k. i have called them multiple times and have tried to get it lowered to no avail.

what are my options? currently i'm paying $250 in interest alone every month and my total monthly payment is around $360. i've been paying around $500 each month to try and chip away at it faster but i realize that it would be a lot faster if i also reconsolidated this loan and also paid 500 every month.

what are some good loan reconsolidating options? i've tried my bank but they don't offer student loan reconsolidating options anymore. i've gone to my parents since they have excellent credit and asked them if they could reconsolidate it for me by taking a personal loan (they could probably get a rate of 3-4% with their credit) and i would just pay them every month instead of sallie mae but they shut that idea down and are not willing to help.

what can i do? any help/criticism would be greatly appreciated and i can provide some additional info if needed.

edit: to further clarify, i know i signed up for variable rate but was told as long as i make the monthly payments on time they wouldn't raise the rate on me (if that's wrong i understand, that's just what i had been told)

for the past 1.5 years i have been making the minimum plus an extra 150-200 dollars, but my interest rate has increased by 3.5 points.

edit 2 from what i've learned  before i go to sleep:

1. always choose fixed rate over variable
2. shop around for rates instead of sticking to one financial institution
3. interest rates can fluctuate for various external reasons (hence always choosing fixed rate)
4. the people of reddit are very helpful! 

thanks everyone!",10
"my husband died suddenly and i'm not sure what to do.. my husband died suddenly on saturday and i'm not sure what to do. we have a mortgage, one car payment, boat payment, $8000 in cc debt, and he did have a small student loan balance. between his esop and iras he has about $200,000.00 and we had a small life insurance policy on him through my work of $12,000.

i will be selling the house, boat, and one of the vehicles and i may just pay off all the cc debt, but i don't want to make any rash decisions.

i'm so lost.

edit/update: thank you all so much for this information. a little more info on our full situation. my husband and i live in  alaska in a more remote area and it was just the two of us. he died while running a 10k and i saw him about 3 minutes before and he was ecstatic and smiling and gave me a thumbs up. both of our families live in new mexico, so i will be moving back there. the boat was just a pleasure boat we'd use on the ocean and luckily it's a very sought after boat in this state so it should move quickly. we have one truck that is paid off and i will be selling that and keeping my subaru. i went ahead and canceled all of the auto payments on his credit cards and i've already begun paperwork on ira's and the life insurance policy. i'm fortunate that my family has means and are able to help me right now. my parents arrived the day after he died and his dad and sister arrived tuesday night, so i have a wonderful support network. i have about 13000 liquid with about 7000 more coming in so i'll be able to make the mortgage payment, car, etc. while we're waiting to clear things out. the esop is not paid out until a year after the event and my dad has already contacted his financial advisor to help me navigate what to do with the money as well as not to be hit hard with taxes. i'll also be able to receive his permanent fund dividend this year which is good since i guess it's supposed to be a whopper. i feel so fortunate that we somewhat had our shit together. my husband and i were both socking money away into our retirement accounts and we had a modest home so we could have lots of adventures, which we did. we lived without regrets and that is really helping me right now. well i guess i slightly misspoke, i wish we did have more life insurance, but hindsights always 20/20. if anyone can learn anything from my situation it is this: life is fleeting. live everyday to the fullest. my husband and i went on adventures nearly every weekend. whether it be hiking, backpacking, bike-packing, boating, fishing, hunting, traveling, we were always doing something. we told each other numerous times a day that we loved each other and we were each others world. i will get through this and i will continue to accomplish the goals that we shared together. life through me a shitty surprise, but it's not the end of the world. i will get better. my beloved loved to tell me to get my shit together when i was being a whiny pants and that's just what i'm going to do. also, because i'm selfish in my grief and if anyone is interested to learn more about my amazing husband(https://www.sewardjournal.com/eedition/page/page_643cb6a9-a712-5261-8d3f-323e2b159dae.html), i wrote a letter of thanks and it's been published in two papers.",10
"girlfriend diagnosed with leukemia w/o insurance last year. now in remission (woo!)... but not without $100,000+ of medical debt.. as the title states;

my girlfriend was diagnosed with leukemia last year and went through chemotherapy at a number of large medical facilities.

a year later, she's in full remission, which is wonderful and the best news possible.

... but...

she now owes money to a variety of medical institutions including three area hospitals, a few doctors offices, medical testing labs, you name it, she has an account there.


she is currently unemployed (because of the intensive treatment), and unable to work for at least the next year. 


what compounds and complicates her situation further is that she is young and unskilled with no current future career path. this meaning that her chances of being able to even make payments at all are pretty slim to none.


what are her options?


would filing for bankruptcy be a fitting option at her age (early 20s)?


if so, what does that process entail? 
she does not own any property or anything of great value. ",10

>for this reason, saving in your 401(k) has the potential to put you in a lower tax bracket, so you owe a smaller percentage of your income in tax. currently, single filers making between $77,400 and $156,150 pay 22%(https://www.fool.com/retirement/2019/01/07/how-will-the-new-tax-law-affect-retirees.aspx) on their income. if you are in the lower end of that range, a 401(k) contribution could move you into the lower bracket, where taxes are just 12%. if you make $80,000 per year, for example, and contribute $5,000, **your resulting income of $75,000 would be taxed at 12% rather than 22%.**

"opening a joint account with my s.o. was the best financial decision i've ever made. about two years ago, my significant other and i were serious enough to open a joint savings account together. i am not great with money, and i tend to spend anything i get. often, i spend any extra money on paying off student loans, but that doesn't negate the fact that my personal accounts frequently hover close to zero. 

with one joint account, we each deposit a set amount every pay cycle. that money cannot be touched for anything besides the already budgeted necessities like rent, groceries and the electric bill. 

because we deposit slightly more than we actually need, in a relatively short time we built up the account and now both have easy access to roughly $2000 in case of emergency. 

i would never have been able to do this alone, but knowing it's our money as opposed to my money means i leave it where it is. i would only use it in a real emergency.

"having a baby, super excited! but any place around here wants 2-300 weekly for childcare. where do people who have never budgeted for child care find an extra thousand/1200 dollars in their existing income stream?. honestly 200ish sounds fairly reasonable. i mean i get it, dont get me wrong. and we're not so bad off that diapers, clothes, ect is going to hurt us. but with health care bills piling up, the expected 2k delivery copay (assuming all goes well) and existing bills already, where does it come from?! 

we've been able to save about 400 a month, and with just eating out less (we go out out 40ish once a week and probably 3-4fast/cheap takeouts each week) well recoup some money to the tune of 100 bucks a week. we'd have more discretionary income if i stopped putting renovations in the house, but not a lot... a new spigot here, a paint job there... i redid the floors in hardwoods recently and still have moldings to buy and install. the new (5 month old) privacy fence needs stained. it's all ( relatively) little stuff and i save a small fortune by turning my own wrenches on the cars, fixing my own plumbing/electrical/interior stuff. 

 we've got a couple grand in savings which i know isn't enough; in fact that number represents slightly less than what my wife nets in a month at her hourly job. of course theres maternity to think about too- complete job security but its unpaid due to her lack of tenure.  

everyone says ""oh you did it in the right order; you moved out, went to college, got married, got good jobs, bought a house before you got pregnant"" but we've not been graduated long- 3 years for me, 2 for her- so the extra i used to throw in savings is gone to eliminating my college debt, the car i have, the downpayment on the house, the fence... 

...i'm realizing this is super long. where have yall found the money to be responsible for this whole other human  life? (mostly the childcare part)

edit: thank you guys all so much for the help. i'm talking to my wife about all this and we feel a lot better. there are some great people out there (and some not so great?..) and i thank you guys for crafting and maintaining this discussion. i'll check back tomorrow for more. ",10
"when buying something, why not think of it in terms of how long it'll take for you at work to pay it off?. a few weeks ago, i was having a discussion with my sister on the merits of buying a new car for $17000 vs a 2 year old car for $14000.

her argument was ""it's only $3000 more for a new car.""

my argument was that $3000 was **200 hours** of work (equivalent to **five weeks**) for her at $15/hour. 

personally i just feel like it helps me a lot whenever i'm making a purchase of anything... in my mind i'm always thinking ""well, i have to work 1.5 hours to pay for that"" and it typically makes me less likely to purchase it. seems like it's a pretty efficient way to save money and increase savings. thoughts?",10

"started selling my plasma. short story, but i'm a broke college kid who can't get enough hours at my work. i had a lot of debt from moving out and other things that came up unexpectedly. i had always donated my blood for free, but went to a place where they buy plasma. i found out my rare blood type (ab+) was worth a $100 a visit (get paid in gift cards).  this little extra income every week has helped me tremendously financially and i suggest if you are in debt or just want extra income, find out what blood type you have and look into how much people will pay you for it.

edit 1: some plasma places will ask you to prove your blood type. i used information from the centers i had donated at before (online profile). can also get info from your doctor i'm sure.

"lost my baby at 35 weeks this morning. *eta some stuff at bottom of post*

so i'm sitting in this hospital bed just waiting for the labor to progress. the reason i'm writing here, even though it's unfortunate i have to think about this at this time, is because i'm currently in a different state (united states citizen) from where i live/am employed- so i'm pretty sure my insurance isn't going to cover jack for this whole ordeal. i'm worried about just how much this bill will be. i've already told the doctor that if it is safe to do so i would like to leave asap (after the baby is delivered of course) to prevent further charges. i'm still considering not getting an epidural to save that cost as well, although mentally i'd much rather not feel any more pain with this nightmare. 


i won't know just how much i'm facing for a while, but i'm sure its safe to assume we're looking at a lot, possibly 10k+? that's just a guess though. i wouldn't be shocked if it was well more, considering what us hospitals charge for everything. 


i also have never planned a funeral. ...we were thinking cremation, and i'm sure the funeral home can give us a quote when the time comes. no seperate ceremony or anything. i hope it isn't too steep. 


so, i guess i'm just wondering if anyone has any helpful advice with regards to saving a bit of money on these types of things and/or the best way to manage what will surely be quite the financial burden most effectively? me and my husband are both employed, and i will definitely try to pick up as many shifts as possible extra (rn). my husband is a bit more limited since he's a professor/musician and where we live isn't the most happenin' place for him to pick up some decent gigs for extra cash. we have a mortgage and 3 kids at home so obviously those things are still a factor. 


i'm just so lost... i guess i'm just hoping for some sort of guidance with this type of thing. anything. i never thought i'd be in this position...and everything feels so crazy. i guess this is the only thing i might find answers for in this whole mess, and i sure would appreciate any advice. thanks in advance for your time.

** so while i was in labor, it obviously became much more painful and i just could not keep up with my replies. i was reading though, and i want everyone to know that i did read every single reply and i went back to the post to catch any replies that do not show up in my inbox. i will respond here. i'm not sure i can reply to everyone individually, as so many of you reached out- and i can't express enough thanks for that. 
- many of you also have unfortunately had similar experiences and i'm so, so sorry for your loss. and thank you for allowing your experience to help another. 

**i did end up getting the epidural for thos who were concerned. i am still in the hospital, and the doctor will probably see me later this morning (i couldn't sleep much, it's 3:45am currently). 

**i put someone in charge of calling funeral homes, as so many of you had great suggestions with that and finding a place that could offer an at cost (and some places, free or close to it). unfortunately/apparently in this area only 2 places even accept stillborn babies, and 1 was about 2k before the urn and they told us you have to buy at least some certain  type of urn. many of you have said that is not true, but this person did not argue with them, she just gathered the info. the other isn't much better, but apparently i don't have much choice either. i will call them tomorrow as i can manage a more stern demeanor when inquiring about specific things/dealing with ruthless upselling. 

**a kind redditor (and another looked up some more generalized info) who works in insurance actually extended a helping hand and is offering me some more personalized (without personal info) guidance, which is so nice and will hopefully lend some answers while we get to figuring out the nitty gritty of it all. 

**i've had a few troll messages, and if you are one please know that i'm an adult who knows when and how to ignore- luckily it doesn't get to me but i do hope you reconsider your actions when messaging others as they may not be as stable/prepared for such a thing, especially when dealing with profound tragedy.

"i would strongly recommend the military for re-setting your life financially and professionally.. basically what the title says.

once upon a time, i had a ba in a social science field that was getting me nothing but low-paid jobs, and i would have needed to go to grad school to ever have a real chance of landing a salaried position. i paid my own way through college and was not willing to take on additional debt for a graduate degree in an already very competitive (and low-paying) field. i wanted to go in a different direction.

i had worked part-time at a law firm during college, and i decided working in a support position (i.e. paralegal/legal assistant) was something i was very interested in. i applied for positions at every law firm in my general area and received nothing but rejection and one invitation to intern for free. no thanks, i had bills to pay.

the military had always been something i'd considered and i did a lot of research on the different branches and what they offered. turns out the army offers an enlisted position that was exactly what i was looking for--paralegal specialist, and since i had a degree i would enter the military as an e-4. the army also guarantees that the specific job you select is written into your contract.

it's now a little over four years since i raised my right hand-- i now work for the department of justice. my military service counts towards my federal retirement and also put me in a higher leave bracket. the high-ranking connections i made in the army jag corps combined with the job experience i received are what landed me this position. i have thousands of dollars in the bank that i saved because i didn't need to pay for housing, food, or health insurance while i served. i'll be able to use a va-backed loan to buy a house when i choose to, and if i want to go back to school i can do so for free using the gi bill.

i write all this because i read this sub regularly and there are so many posts by people who don't make a living wage, or majored in something unmarketable (like me) and don't know what the next step should be, or who have student loan debt, or are just kind of lost in life. and i think military service could benefit a lot of those people.

of course this comes with a large caveat: the military comes with risks. you could deploy, you could be in combat, you could die, you could be involved in a freak training accident, etc. you could also get stuck in a terrible unit with toxic leadership. it's all luck of the draw really. i was incredibly fortunate in having a positive experience but i know many aren't so fortunate. it's the ultimate 'your experience may vary' scenario. 

but at least for me it was a great way to kickstart my career in the direction i wanted to go and set myself up financially. i just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone who may be considering the service.",10

"june goal: do not buy breakfast or lunch out!. me: 31/f, fully employed, $3,145 net take home each month

i have been slowly working my way out of credit card debt for the past three years. with a little over one year of payments left to go on my $20k debt consolidation loan, i can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

with that, i have been closely monitoring where my money has been going this year. i am very good about tracking how my money is distributed (bills, rent, loan payments, etc) but have never been good about tracking what i have been spending my money on. in looking at my spending habits in january, february, march, april, and now may i have confirmed what i already knew in my head... i spend a shit ton of money eating out. in january, i spent $400 eating out on just breakfast (coffee) and lunches alone. in february, close to $500. same goes for march and april. i was way down in may because i made a conscious effort to not eat out so that i could save up for a trip i took. it helped a lot.

i took a look at my calendar and found that i miraculously have one lunch appointment on the calendar and no breakfast appointments in june. this means i have an opportunity to save money by eating breakfast at home and packing my lunch every day. 

i know this seems so simple but i haven't always been good about this. my work culture is such that people eat out a lot, i meet with people over coffee or lunches frequently, and so on. some of that i get reimbursed but a lot of it is just eating out with coworkers. i live in a mid-sized city, so lunches cost anywhere from $10-18/lunch. not terrible, but like many of you know, that adds up!

i'm excited to challenge myself this month and hopefully save a butt load of money. this money could be better spent either in savings account (that's dismal right now) or paying off loans. 

thanks for reading. i really feel like i am starting to make a turn in how i manage money and am so looking forward to financial freedom in the very near future. my june goal to not eat breakfast or lunches out will help give me the boost i need and hopefully, become a habit of mine.

**edit (6/1, 8:40am est):** 
wow! i wasn't quite expecting that type of response! a couple of things i learned from you.

* scaling back or cutting the number of meals you eat out can make a big difference financially.  
* it can also make a difference health-wise!  
* it's important to be strategic about when you eat out, especially when it comes to work and colleagues. even though you aren't going out and buying lunch, don't exclude yourself from group situations if possible.  
* when meal planning, variety is key. some of you mentioned getting bored with the meals you were making at home and as a result, would slip up and buy food.  
* r/mealprepsunday was mentioned several times as a resource for planning.  
* really examine why you're in debt to begin with. and once you pay off that debt, consider investing the money you no longer are using to pay down debt. your future self with thank you!  
* more than anything, it's about having realistic goals and making sure you aren't setting yourself up for failure. 

i very much enjoyed reading all of your responses, tips, and well-wishes! it has given me great motivation for today - day 1! for breakfast i had cheerios at home. i packed myself a lunch and headed to work where i am now sipping a free hazelnut coffee. 

i look forward to catching up with you all at the end of the month. for my own purposes, i will be keeping a daily log of what i spend (including non-food related items), what i meal prep and eat, and what noticeable changes i see. i've never had a ""blog"" so to speak, but i might consider starting one so i can share all of this with you later this month. any suggestions you have for sites would be most helpful!

(i don't know if i should say the name of the company, although at this point they completely deserve it) but last year i bought a single box from this company to be mailed to me. you have to request a box to be charged, it's not an automatic subscription. 
however, i woke up one recent morning to my bank alerting me that i'd overdrawn from my account. i look at the statement and the company has charged me for 3 of their boxes. i got an email from the company saying it was a ""server error"" and that they'd fix it all same day. 

so i wait a day. 
they refund me for one box. 
i wait two days. 
on the morning of the second day i wake up to my bank alerting me again, because the company has charged me again for that box they refunded, as well as a fourth one for good measure. i now have large bank fees for my insufficient funds and i'm kind of freaking out. 

they owe me $428 for the boxes and the bank fees are $68 and climbing. i've called and called and emailed and emailed. what should i do? i feel robbed!

edit: 
thank you so much everyone for your help! i went to my bank and disputed the charges and got my money back as well as a new card coming in the mail. the company (quarterly co.) still hasn't replied to my emails but i'm fine with that at this point. i don't want anything to do with them anymore. 
thanks again :) ",10
"how my emergency fund made a horrible week a little more bearable.. they say you should start every story with a hook. here's my hook: a friend of mine came to my house about three weeks ago and confessed that she was seriously considering killing herself.

after many hours and tears i managed to convince my friend to go to the er and sat with her all night there. she confessed to the crisis worker that her husband has been abusing her and that she was planning on overdosing that night. when her husband found out she was in the er, he threatened to divorce her to make her leave. mercifully, the hospital ""blue sheeted"" her, meaning she was held by law and admitted to the psych ward. 

 i'm a very recent graduate on the job prowl and living under a very tight budget (i've been using ynab and it's spectacular!). despite the narrowness of my finances and largely due to this lovely subreddit i've been striving very hard over the last year to build a little emergency fund. this emergency fund was the absolute tits during this trying time.

i told my friend i had the means to pay the hospital copay if she couldn't. during that night in the er while she peed in a cup i bought myself some tea and snacks. early in the morning i went shopping for a pair of drawstring-free sweatpants for her because she was sad and afraid and cold and hospital gowns suck balls. i also found her a book to keep her occupied, since psych ward patients are not allowed any form of media. when i was allowed to visit her at the hospital i bought myself a big old cafeteria meal with all the available comfort foods. when she got transferred to a hospital farther away i filled up my gas tank. when i had to cover her shift at work, after not sleeping for two days, i bought all the coffee. all of it. i didn't have the energy to cook so i ate out. when all the stress, sleep loss, and hospital time gave me a goddamn cold, i bought some medicine. after about three days in hell i finally got a chance to sleep. i rested so easily knowing my friend was safe and my finances were secure. all of the money i spent during that time was just sitting there waiting for something like this to happen.

she spent nearly a week in the ward and was put on medications. she says now she's happier than she's ever been. she's not out of the abusive relationship yet (that's going to be a whole other beast) but it sounds like she's gaining the tools she needs to take care of herself.

shit happens, mental health is serious, and emergency funds are super rad. if you don't have one, start one.

thanks for convincing me that the pain-in-the-ass process of saving for unforseeable events when you're poor is totally worth it.

"advice: accidentally got paid 80 hrs of overtime. i get paid biweekly (924.25) and work 40 hrs a week. i recently got paid for 80 hrs of normal work and 80 hrs of overtime (2075.82). it was someone's mistake working on the payroll. once they realized their mistake, i was paid 0.00 for the next paycheck and 498.60 for the next. a total of 2574.42 for the 3 paychecks. 

i would normally make 2772.75 for 3 paychecks. so this is a difference of 198.33 due to having more taxes taken out of the large amount i was accidentally paid. i've been trying to figure out what to do about it. i would like to be paid the 198.33 but the lady i talked to said the taxes have been paid and there's nothing she can do. 

i've been trying to get this resolved. the people managing my paycheck accused me of intentionally doing this and that i tried to hide the mistake. i notified my boss the day i was paid and we couldn't get in touch with the payroll people for a week. so i don't know if there's nothing that can be done or if they just don't want to do anything. 

should i just let this go? or do i file it when i do my taxes? 

edit: thanks so much everyone! this is my first job/ the first time i will be filing taxes so i just wasn't clear on everything. as long as i'll get it back at the end i'm okay with waiting. i now realize that i was paid the same and taxed differently and there's nothing payroll can do now to fix this. 

edit 2: wow thank you all so much for your input! i'm surprised this got so much attention for such a small issue. i will worry about the 198 when i file my taxes! also i will read everyone's comments tonight and reply to them. 

edit 3: okay so while i was at work i spoke to a lady briefly and she just kept telling me there wasn't anything they could do to fix the problem and the money was already sent away from the initial pay check. my boss was calling me at the same time so i told her i had to go. i haven't gotten the chance to call her back today. i just got an email saying my case number has been closed! (they gave me a case number when i reported a problem) i feel like they're trying to hide something. not exactly my issue but i'm sure they have messed up bigger things in the past and they don't want me to draw attention? i'm okay with just letting all of it go. but it's ridiculous that they closed my case without me getting a chance to talk  ",10

"my mother just died. i am 24 years old. i don't know how to handle anything.. edit; thank you for every single one of you, omg. i can't believe how much advice i am getting. it's so overwhelming. i am reading every single one of your posts and i can't respond to you all, but thank you thank you thank you.

i requested a autopsy because: 

yes, she had pancreatic cancer but it was early stages. she had surgery to get a tumor removed, and was doing chemotherapy because she had 2 lymph nodes that were infected. she was doing really well, generally tired, but not very many side affects from the chemo. on monday, she went back to work, and she felt really good. tuesday, wednesday, both good. thursday she took off work because that is when she had chemo and she wanted to rest. thursday she was talking to a family friend saying she was just tired and didnt feel very good. thursday she probably should have went to the hospital but didnt. 

3 am: my mother called 911 and told them she couldnt breathe. my grandma heard her and called out to her and she responded to her, and she was laying on the bathroom floor. once the ambulance got there she was unresponsive and they took her to the er and gave her medicine that would help her heart and then they would do cpr. once the medicine wore off, her pulse would stop, they'd give her more meds, and it would last for about 2 minutes. her heart wouldnt beat on its own. they did this cycle about 12 times. they tried 1 last thing, gave her some medicine that is supposed to clear a blood clot, and see if that would help, but it did not. i had to make the decision (as her poa) to stop the machines and let her go. (i was watching them as they did this... and nothing seemed to help)

as the family we decided to do an autopsy because we don't know exactly what caused her death. yes she had cancer, but she said she couldnt breathe. a heart attack? a blood clot? we dont know, and the er doctor did not know. my mother was my best friend, and i really took care of her these last few months, it's hard to see her go the way she did.


hi all, please bare with me. i am all over the place and i would like some guidance on what to do in this type of situation. 
my mother just died unexpectedly yesterday. i have some guidance from family on what to do but i want to see what other people think so i am coming to you. 

my mother owned her house, only 10k left to pay on it. 
she lost her job about 4 years ago or so, used all of her savings account and 401k to live off of. she finally got a job last year making half of what she used to make, but still able to pay her bills. she fell sick this year (stage 1-2 pancreatic cancer, found early, had surgery) so she was off of work since april. they were giving her half of her paycheck, and then whatever fell short i gave her money. i've paid her mortgage twice, i pay her comcast bill on the regular. my grandmother lives with her and she pays our phone bill. so all my mom really pays is the utilities of the house, and our car insurance. (me, her, and my brother). 

she has built up some credit card debt, which from what i can see on her bank account is $13k. she has some other bills that aren't paid, just because she couldnt afford it. 

my brother doesn't help her much, maybe a few hundred here and there, but it's never enough. i've used my savings account just to pay for her mortgage, when i live with my boyfriend and give him half for our mortgage too. needless to say, my account is going down. i get $1,300 every two weeks for my paycheck. depends on how much i work.

anyways, i called her life insurance agent and he was going to put in a claim, although we have to wait for her death certificate and her autopsy report. which having an autopsy done is costly and delays services. i just don't know what i am supposed to do with all of her bills, the car insurance, the phone bill, the house.. i don't know what to do with it all, and it may seem early to be thinking of this, but i want to be ready to know what to do. 

my grandma lives with her. i don't know what to do with my grandma. i think she plans on staying in the house but that's a lot of money to keep paying off when i don't live there. 

also, i know she has a will. how do i find out about that? do i need to get a laywer?

please anyone.. help me

"i 34m was told last month i was getting a 15% raise on my salary 47.5k; got my first paycheck today and my net pay only increased by $150. where'd my raise go?. the company i work for told me last month i was approved for a 15% raise; that seemed like a lot but i have been really busting my ass this year to prove my worth (in preparation for asking for said raise) and felt pretty accomplished when i got the good news. by my calculations it would but my gross pay right around $54k, which for the field i work in is not too bad for a non-management position. my calculations told me i'd see an increase in my after-tax pay of about $400, which i was planning on throwing at my debt and car payment to expedite clearing them out.

to my surprise, i checked my paystub this morning and my net pay only increased by $150. my gross pay seems to check out re: the increase i was told i was getting, but it seems like most of it has been swallowed up by taxes (over $1.1k this month alone). at the end of the day, my annual take home pay is only increasing ~$2k, off a raise that boosted my annual gross over $7k. so here's my question: am i getting over-deducted in my taxes, or is this what the news means when they talk about the death of the middle class? 

addendum 1: i am paid monthly.

addendum 2: per recommendations from the comments, i went back and pulled my last pre-raise paystub to compare withholdings. my previous gross pay was $3,900 and my federal withholdings were $377/month; adding in social security and medicare + my $60 in health care deductions, my total deductions pre-raise were ~$730. post-raise: my gross pay is $4,552, medicare and social security withholdings only raised a little bit, but my federal tax jumped up to $763/month, over double what it was last month and is the bulk of why my total deductions were over $1.1k. i'm gonna check with hr and see if that's where it's supposed to be.

addendum 3: talked with hr, they confirmed there was a mistake with the paystub service/program they use in the federal withholding calculations this month; they've fixed the glitch and are crediting me back the difference. so, raise found! thanks for everyone's thoughtful replies.",10

i hope this doesn't break rules of the subreddit. i also hope this never happens to any of you as the entire thing can be really stressful. the identitytheft.gov website is a true breath of fresh air.

basically some dickweed employee put my dl number and name (that's it) on 2 gold's gym memberships totally $7,000 (commission?). these memberships were made 2 weeks apart. some debt collectors i guess purchased the debt from gold's gym and think this cash grab is worth pursuing.

debt collectors will threaten you with:

- may have to appear in court
- may have to pay court charges, legal fees, and more
- get my credit rocked
- potential seizure, freezing, and sale of personal assets

legal, credit, finance - all scary stressful stuff in this context.

if you go to the identitytheft.gov(https://identitytheft.gov) though, you can talk to an **actual person**. they also have this extremely easy wizard to click through your situation and it will auto-generate a ""recovery plan"" including dispute letters, steps to contact law enforcement, putting credit freezes, and basically protecting yourself. it also explains your rights pretty well too.

"very productive year, disappointing raise, boss said he had too many ""good"" employees. i had a really great year with my company (very large 50000+ employees), deployed 2 new initiatives and was a major part of my department's bi-annual audit.  we got the best scores ever, and both my boss and his boss stated that it was in large part due to the information i was able to provide.

my department is broken up into teams, and the team that i'm on consists of my boss and 4 others.  i have the highest rank of the other team members, although some have been here longer than me.  i am also the only woman on my team, and the highest ranking woman in the department.
  
when the written annual review came up, my boss marked ""exceptional"" or ""outstanding"" for all of my categories.  this week, we got our raises, and mine was very disappointing.  with the scale being 0-4%, i got exactly 2%.  in the past years here, i've never gotten lower than 2.5%, usually 3%, and i've never had a busier or more productive year than 2018.  i honestly thought the past year was my best ever here, and that my raise would be at least 3%.  

in recent calls, my boss has made comments along the lines of how he has such a great team, and how everyone has exceeded their goals.  i used to be a manager (at another company), so i understand the whole ""pool of percentages"" and that things have to be divided fairly (from the manager's perspective).  however, i have always believed that each employee is an individual and should be evaluated as such.  if everyone had an outstanding year, then everyone should receive and ""outstanding"" percentage increase.    

we do not work in the same office or even the same state.  i call at least once a week (usually goes to vm), send weekly updates on progress, and email every day (about something or nothing), just to stay in touch.  i'm pretty sure he's going to use the remote aspect and lesser communication as part of the reason – however he is the one who consistently cancels our weekly calls and does not answer emails.  

he is going to call me later today to discuss.  i know there is no way to change this now, but please help me calm down and determine the right things to say.

update:  first, thank you to every single one of you for taking the time to respond.  i have been reading through all of the posts and seriously appreciate your opinions.  

my boss called a little while ago.  i told him i was surprised and disappointed in the increase amount, given the exceptional work ""we"" had done.  he said that everyone on our team was given 2%, that the amount was set by our cio and the only way to give anyone more would mean someone would get less.   

he also ""reminded"" me that i am the only one on our team (besides him) that gets a bonus.  that comment has led me to believe that i in fact was given more than 2%, and he took my extra and divided it among the others on my team.  whatever.  today has been an eye-opener for me, for sure.

freakin novella:

so a couple weeks ago i received some fairly ambiguous and uncomfortable news that caused me to really think about the state i'd be leaving my beloved wife in if i were to die. original post (https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8co3an/i_might_be_kicking_the_bucket_what_do_i_need_to/)  

it felt great to know that her promising career and our financial position would carry her through the worst case scenario, but i also identified a number of of things that i should address and i believe they may apply to some of you. it's become a bit of a stereotype that only fiscal nerds and the elderly need to be concerned with stuff like this, but i'm a reasonably healthy 28 year old that just left the army and i spent the last two weeks scrambling to deal with this stuff because of a random blob on an mri. 

**first thing is first, i'm not an attorney or finance professional and this is just stuff that i've observed throughout this process. please feel free to speak up if you disagree with whatever follows; i'd definitely appreciate making sure i'm doing everything i can do here.** 


**1.** the first thing that i did after leaving the doctor's office was drive to a lawyer's. it might seem unnecessary and like a waste of money, but i'm glad i did and i wish i had gone sooner. i'm fortunate enough to have access to ""free"" legal services by virtue of being on active duty; however, i would have happily paid to know that i'm preventing my wife from taking on additional hardship during what would likely be a very already difficult time in her life. even if you don't have a medical concern, i still strongly recommend doing it because shit happens. a lawyer may also save you from the ramblings of a random man on the internet. 

**1.a.** i, stupidly, believed i understood the way things worked. i thought my wife would inherit everything because she's my wife, right? what's mine is hers, as we often see with posts about brutal divorces, and our situation is very simple (only one beneficiary, no crazy property stuff, etc.). what i didn't consider about that reasoning was that divorce is usually a drawn out legal process under the best of terms. i had wrongly assumed that joint ownership was sort of inferred by virtue of our marriage. my wife almost certainly would have gained access to all my assets, but only after having dealt with a lengthy legal process and piles of paperwork (that shit takes 18 months in virginia). it makes me ridiculously sad, and upset with myself, to think of my wife dealing with all that stress in the midst of such a traumatic time because she married an idiot know-it-all. 

**2.** my first step toward making life easy on her was making sure she had easy access to my (our) money. we've kept our finances separated because we feel it's a wise choice for newlyweds. i still feel this way; however, our circumstances have changed and i was unwilling to leave her exposed to the risk of the aforementioned stress.  there were three options here: handle it using a ""last will and testament,"" add her to my account, or set up a ""payment upon death."" i'll get into the will thing a little later, but i didn't like it for this situation and my intent. instead, i chose to add her to the account because she would have (actually has) direct and immediate access to those accounts without dealing with any bureaucracy. the last option is sort of a middle-ground between all the other steps. ""payment upon death"" is a way of telling you bank to give all your stuff to someone when you die. this offers protection from the risks of a joint account while circumventing lengthy administrative processes; however, i didn't like the idea of my wife having to prove to some strangers that i was dead. i'm sure this wouldn't be too unreasonable of a process, but i just saw it as another burden for her to deal with as she worked through everything.

**3.** the next step was making sure she had access to the investments i made. this was easy because i'm behind a lot of you and only have holdings in a few mutual funds.  those holdings are linked to my banking accounts and i've left my wife with a detailed explanation of what they are and how to deal with them, sell them, etc. i also explained the order in which i believe she should sell them and the scenarios that would justify doing so. 

**4.** the final asset to worry about was my car. if the worst happens and my death is inevitable, i'll trade in both of our cars so that she can have one brand new one and remove one more potential stress factor during that time. for now, i'm just working on adding her as a joint owner so that she has more control (as with the bank account) and won't be subject to the bureaucracy i keep mentioning. 

**5.** the ""silver bullet"" for addressing any of my oversights in preparation for my wife having to deal with all my assets during this process is a general durable power of attorney. there's a huge amount of risk exposure here, as with joint bank accounts, because this allows someone to legally act on your behalf. i can't begin to tell you how many guys i've watched meltdown afghanistan because their wife took everything and divorced them using that power of attorney. that being said, i have complete faith in my wife and you can also set these up to have a limited scope or scale (e.g. timeframe, what it applies to, etc.). mine will also be secured in a safety deposit box with other key documents that she'll be able to access if i die. 

**6.** my last main effort has been compiling a massive document of everything. this document will also be in the safety deposit box and will contain login information for literally everything (bank stuff, credit cards, utilities, car loan, computers, social media, netflix, etc.). it also contains details on how and when various bills are paid, where spare keys for the cars are, the type of oil her car needs, the order in which to sell investments, advice on financially moving forward (you guys make an appearance), approximate values for any of my stuff that happens to be valuable so that she doesn't get taken advantage of, contact information for the attorney, etc.  this is literally just a giant pile of everything, almost like a reference book for me. my intent here was to provide her with more information than necessary because i don't want her to deal with the stress of something working through netflix password recovery when she moves. 

**7.** i previously mentioned that a ""last will and testament"" wasn't ideal for my circumstances. the truth is, relying solely on one would have done a shitty job of fulfilling my intent here. i don't have a lot of stuff and i want my wife to have everything, so some massive undertaking isn't necessary to ensure the proper transfer of my ""estate."" these documents certainly have their purpose, but in my case this document was only slightly better than relying on community property laws and probate. the common expectation, at least in my experience, is that the bereaved sit down in an office with lots of hardwood and leather-bound books while a stuffy man with a stack of paper quickly takes care of the rest. after speaking with an attorney, this really didn't seem to be the case. i ended up having one drawn up to serve as a tertiary contingency plan in the event that this somehow becomes what is best for my wife, but i really didn't like it and hope she won't rely on it because my previous steps were effective.

**8.** the last thing i did was an advanced medical directive. in the interest of saving my wife from having to deal with the reality of deciding whether or not i should die i went ahead and did it myself. i outlined the criteria for which medical staff will have to follow and i set limits on what i was comfortable with with regard to prolonging my life. this in and of itself was worth the trip because i know the scenario that this could apply to would tear my wife apart.  



so, all that being said- is there anything else i can do here?

* each row denotes a day, so you can keep track daily. i find it best to do that. i keep my receipts and at the end of the day i quickly add up the total for each category and put it in the correct cell (i also write a comment for each cell so i can remember what it was that i did with that money. ex: if i go out to lunch and dinner i add both totals in the food cell for that day (=5.54+25) and then in the comment i write: breakfast at starbucks, lunch at slater's)

* column j is the monthly totals. halves breaks the month into 2 from the 1st to the 15, and from the 15th to the end of the month).

* the initial row in column n and o are there to put the amount of money in your checking and savings account that you have the morning of the 1st (take into account the money that has not cleared due to the holiday).

* column m is for the description of where the money comes. so if its from your employer you can put work, if its from taxes, you label it taxes and so on.

* column n is for the actual income amount. so if your paycheck is $2,000 after taxes you write that down on the corresponding cell of the day you were paid. 

* then on column o, you can add anything that you pass to your savings account. so if your paycheck was $2,000 and are saving $500 of those, you put the $2,000 in column n, and then the $500 in column o.

* p18 holds a marker for the amount you have available in your checking account, p19 shows your savings, and p20 shows your liquid cash. i keep that near the month i'm on so i can quickly see this amount instead of having to scroll down the sheet and find it there (these are the same amounts as m370, o368 and m368, respectively).

* the boxes labeled net gain in column p show the relationship between the amount you spent that month with the amount you made that month. if its a negative number, you spent more than you made.

* p25 is a rough hourly estimate of how much you are making per month (it's a left over from the days i was paid hourly. the 4.3333 is the 52 weeks divided into 12 months. not the best but its supposed to be a rough estimate).

* row 368 gives you your up-to-date year totals in each category for the expenses. for the income section it gives you your total amount in bank (savings and checking) and then savings and checking amounts individually.

* the monthly payments section starting at b370, simple adds the defined amounts that need to be paid each month, settings a basic expenses monthly total. (this helps me see how much i spend over the basic things i need to pay for)

* in the income section starting in l376 you can change the change the formulas in m377 and m378 to include your jobs' names. this goes with what you put in column m and it keeps track for you of the income per source. 

* the section starting at b379 is the totals from column j neatly organized to see the month expense totals, average, minimums and maximums for each category. you can make some neat charts from this.

* this year i added a new net worth tab to this sheet. i want to thank u/secondnameia who inspired me to do this from this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/55wngb/ive_been_tracking_my_net_worth_for_7_years_xpost/). 
how this works: at the end of the month i look up the amounts in my bank, the value of my stocks, hard assets (house, collectibles, cars, etc.), retirement assets (401k, and any other sort of savings account for this purpose), and the debt i have on credit and add it to the specific month. this will figure out your net worth and give you some percentage data. (this section is still pretty new, but works fine for what i want) (also, for the house, i don't own a house i put my guitars and lego collectables on this section but i'm guessing if you do own a house/houses, you might want to subtract the mortgage amount from the value of the house but i'm really not sure how to go about it for this case)

one thing to note: this chart does not take into account any expenses done with credit cards. i try to avoid those at all costs so i hardly ever have to worry about it. 

let me know if you have any questions and i'll try to explain what the sheet does.

"florida 'no surprises' law.. just thought i'd share this as i sometimes see health insurance issues here.

i got a bill from a medical test that was taken in a doctors office that was in network. a year later i got a bill for the test that they had sent out to a company in california that was not in network.  

i was about to just write a check and be done with it and decided to call and pay with my rewards credit card so it wasn't a total loss. i complained about the bill to the customer service rep i got and she said 'let me put you on hold because florida has a no surprises law'.  while on hold i googled it and it passed in 2016. 

since it was out of network but from an in network dr/issue the bill was zeroed out and i don't have to pay it. 

it was nuts. from a $400 bill to nothing and had i not called i would have been out $.

there may be other states with this law so check before you pay.",10
"psa: useful personal finance loopholes. a lot of personal finance advice is straightforward applications of math: keep expenses less than income.  pay off highest interest rate debts first.  compound growth is your friend.

then there are obvious legal requirements and benefits:   use tax-preferred retirement / hsa accounts.  keep insurance in force.   know how self-employment taxes work. 

this post is about less-obvious but still interesting-to-redditors ways to use loopholes / benefits in existing us laws to your advantage.  there's an endless number of these, but some come into play frequently enough that it makes sense to raise awareness about  them.  our friends in other countries, especially the uk and canada, are welcome to lobby for local versions in their associated personal finance subs, see links in the sidebar. i don't know those laws...

here are some that you may not already know about:

tax planning:

- if you earn less than 30k single / 60k jointly, you can use the saver's credit(https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit) to get a tax credit for a portion of your ira or 401k contributions, even for roth contributions. full-time students are not eligible.

- you pay no taxes at all on long-term capital gains(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/no-capital-gains-due-for-some-investors-1.aspx) if your taxable income (including those gains) is less than the top of the 15% tax bracket.  that could be $95,000 gross income for a married couple filing jointly.  this is better than a roth in that you can do this at any age.

- sales of a personal residence often have no capital gains tax(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/capital-gains-and-your-home-sale-1.aspx) as well.  various rules apply.  

- if you rent a room in your house, part of all of your housing expenses (including insurance and utilities) can be schedule e expense deductions against your rental income(http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-out-room-your-house.html) (but you need to declare the rental income).  

- take advantage of ""adjustments(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/cut-your-taxes-without-itemizing-1.aspx)"" like student loan interest, tuition, moving costs, etc., that don't require itemization if you are eligible.  

retirement:

- employer contributions to your 401k don't count(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/retirement/employer-match-counts-toward-401k-limit.aspx) against the 18k limit.  

- if you change you mind about making an ira contribution, e.g. your income becomes too high for it to be allowable, you can simply remove the money(https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/excess-contribution) before the tax filing deadline without penalty.

-  for redditors with more ""life experience"", you can increase your contributions (https://www.trustetc.com/resources/investor-awareness/contribution-limits) to a 401k and ira at age 50, and your hsa contributions  at age 55.

- self-employed people have lots of options(https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people) for retirement accounts.  this can apply even if you have employment retirement savings.

- think you make too much to contribute to roth ira?  think again!  the ever-popular backdoor roth ira(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/backdoor-roth-ira-high-income-how-to-guide/) may work for you.  but no, i am not adding the mega-backdoor roth.  there are some places even i won't go.

health insurance:

- if you change jobs and don't have insurance coverage for a time, you have 60 days to elect continuing (cobra) coverage.  this works retroactively(http://www.mymoneyblog.com/cobra-and-retroactive-health-insurance-coverage.html); you can decide to take cobra at day 59 and be covered for the previous 59 days.  yes, we get that cobra is expensive.  but it's free if you wait to elect it and don't need it, but you're still covered because you can elect it retroactively.  any other health insurance you'd have to pay for but probably still not use.

- you won't pay a penalty for lack of health insurance if you have a single  brief coverage gap(http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-coverage-gap-exemption/), which is defined as ""less than three months.""  i.e. may 1 to july 28 is ok.  may 1 to july 31 is not.

"my girlfriend found a company that helps people who are financially struggling, but i fear they're scamming us. my girlfriend found a lady who claimed she works for a company called the young america mutual insurance company, and their whole shtick is they take insurance deposits of people that have passed away, and donate those to the younger people of america who are struggling with debt and making ends meet. the person at the company told her that she would transfer money to our account, my girlfriend would then transfer back about 70% of it, and the other 30% would be ours to keep.

she needed to know our bank acct info before doing the transfer, so we emptied out the account just to be safe, and did the double transfer like she said. and then we did it the next day. and the whole time this is going on she is keeping in *constant* communication. like messaging everyday constantly, just to make sure everything is going perfectly.

my girlfriend is now getting just as skeptical as i am, because the woman told us to withdraw the money and send snaps of it to her. we withdrew as much as the atm would allow, but just want to sit on it for awhile, because we know people have gotten in trouble for spending money that isn't theirs. is this money ours, or are we getting scammed or used as a way to launder money or something?",10
"i found a fake wells fargo account with my name on it, what next?. i was checking my credit reports and i found a wells fargo credit card opened in my name. i have never dealt with wells fargo. 

the account was open from 12/2013 to  4/2014. it had a $5000 limit, and the ""high credit"" listed on my credit report was for almost all of it. it was paid on time, and then closed.

i have a lot of questions. since it's for a closed account with payments made on time, should i report it to the credit bureaus or just leave it alone? does this mean my information has been stolen? should i file a complaint with someone, since this is probably a fake account created by wells fargo?",10
"retailers taking advantage of the ""buy in bulk to save"" assumption of shoppers. ever buy in bulk to save on the per unit cost? the battle to get your money's worth used to only be whether you would use all of the bulk items you bought. beware, i've noticed amazon sellers taking advantage of this assumption and charging more for bulk buying.

i don't know if they prices will show up the same for everyone, but as an example 1 qt of oil is $6.47. a 5 qt jug is $7.69 per qt. a 3 pack of 5 qt jugs is 8.02 per qt. a 6 pack of 1 qt jugs is $9.85 per qt.

i've noticed this tactic at local grocery stores too. be sure to calculate the per unit cost when buying anything these days, folks.

edit: sorry about the notifications, no idea why it happened. many people i talked to irl were shocked when i told them about this, so i thought i'd share for the people who don't know that paying more for bulk is becoming a common practice.

edit2: this has blown up a bit, with a surprising number comments about toilet paper. i always get the big charmin pack from costco.",10
"t-mobile made a mistake and billed me for a month after i cancelled. they agreed it was a mistake and said they'd fix it. i just got a mail from a collections agency saying i can settle that t-mobile bill. i saw my credit score was hit hard by this as well.. so last year i cancelled my t-mobile plan. i went into the store and paid everything i owed up to the end of the billing cycle. i had no phones to be paid off, just the service bill. i paid it off and cancelled my service and they agreed i wouldn't get any more bills since i paid off my current cycle.

well the following month i got a full bill as if my subscription was never cancelled. i called into customer service and after a while of arguing with different reps they finally agreed that yes they did make a mistake and it was taken care of.

well a few days ago i got a letter in the mail from an attorney's office of some sort saying i can settle the t-mobile bill for like $100 less than what i ""owe"" t-mobile. 

i just checked my credit score on my credit card and it dropped 100 points as of last month. i've never had any delinquent payments and never been sent to collections. according to my cc i had a credit score of 805 3 months ago. now it's 695. 

i don't know what to do now. i'm pretty upset by this. do i really have to pay a bill for services that i no longer used?? how do i fix my credit score?",10
"spend $1500+/month on groceries and eating out, please help!. for as long as i can remember, my family has eaten out 75% of meals.  my mother is the only mother i've ever known who is a certifiably terrible cook (my dad refuses to eat any fruits or vegetables or anything with spices other than s+p, so that doesn't help).  throughout college, i worked full time while going to school full time and spent most of my money pursuing the same habits, getting wendy's or taco bell 4-5 times a week.  i've never really learned to cook and when i think about it psychologically i realize i definitely turn to fast food as a comfort and really enjoy the feeling of ""being out"" at a restaurant or something.   i'm really unhappy if i manage to not eat out for a week or so and feel miserable.

now i'm older, 30, and i make around $200k a year.  but my habits have still not matured.  it's not fast food, but i still go to fast casual restaurants and fancy places 7-10 times a week, often paying for my gf. i checked my mint.com records recently and found i was spending upwards of $1500/month on this, which i realize is ridiculous.   i need to change and just feel a little overwhelmed with how to do so.  is this a case for therapy or is there something simpler i can do in the meantime?   

edit: whoa, this blew up. thanks everyone for the great advice.  i was an inaugural member of blue apron years ago and was frustrated with their selection a lot of the time. too much cod. yuck. anyway a lot of it went to waste anyway as i'd just ignore my blue apron food to eat out anyway. anyway i got rid of that a few years ago. i think the suggestions to do things gradually and without the use of a food service are good and i'm gonna try those. 

i agree with those of you who suggested it is not hard to cook. i should have been clearer in the op - i can cook fine, i just don't ever desire to cook at home. i genuinely prefer fast food and fine dining (curiously i sometimes prefer fast food). just thought i'd try and get some ideas from folks i respect (this forum) on how to change that.   i can probably ""afford"" it but i just don't want to. i would prefer to spend what an average person does and just save the rest.

edit 2:  since everyone was asking, i work in a big law firm. also i thought i'd give an update - i made a bunch of breakfast burritos to eat over the next two weeks instead of my usual latte and muffin out, and cooked enough chili for leftovers for the rest of the week. one day at a time.",10
"do you ever view ""not spending money"" as ""earning money""?. example:

tomorrow, i have to fly for business.  12 hours in the back of economy.  for $625, i could have upgraded to a lie-flat business class seat.  it was tempting, as i could *technically* afford it.  (i'm not rich by any means, but i'm not struggling.)

instead, i'm choosing to go without.  because the way i see it, in 12 hours i can either have some mild cramping that will pass in a day or two and $625 in my bank, or i can hopefully have a decent sleep but wake up with a large dent in my bank account.  

now, here's the thing: i would love that upgrade.  i've talked myself into it being a wise idea for a number of reasons.  so i've counted that money as being gone in a way - but by selling my shot at the upgrade, i've earned that $625.  

yes, i know i haven't actually gained more money by not spending it...but in a way, it feels like i have.  does anyone else ever treat big potential purchases this way?

edit: first off, wow.  did not expect this to take off.  second: the moment that plane touched down, i had such a great feeling of ""i am so glad i didn't spend that money"".  felt richer as soon as i set foot in the airport.",10
"an employers point of view of someone not getting paid.. ive spent a lot of time reading this subreddit and almost every week or so, without fail, someone posts something about how their employer is doing something shady, trying to not pay them, giving them bad checks, etc. and everyone here immediately goes to 'call department of labor on their ass! these weasels are stealing from you!'. and i am not suggesting it doesnt happen, but i am here to tell you a short version from the employers point of view. 

my wife and i run a small shop, have 3 great employees and my wife works a ton with them. we tried hiring someone else, immediately saw it was a bad fit, and let her know we werent able to continue her employment. fast forward a week, we had a problem with our payroll and instead of direct deposit, we had to cut checks for everyone. we immediately emailed her to let her know, told her she could pick it up. she opted for us to mail it to her and the next day, we did. 

since then, i've been told i am running a scam, i am a con artist, thief, threatened, 2am emails, etc. first it took the post office 5 days to get her the check. not much i can do. then it took 3 days for the bank to deposit the check. again, not much i can do. everything was our fault despite us trying to help her get her money as fast as we could.

i dont want to get too far into details and eventually the check cleared, but a lot of people here are quick to start blaming employers for payment issues. sometimes, things are out of employers hands. sometimes, people bend their perspective of things where they are a victim and quickly come looking to others to validate their point of view. in my case, there was nothing more i could do to help this person, but i was still the piece of shit who was trying to steal from someone.

"psa - parents don't be afraid to educate or explain your financial situation to your kids, particularly as you both get older. i think financial education is a great thing at any age, but i can appreciate talking about finances - especially family details - can be a sticky, tricky topic.  we are often taught that money isn't an appropriate subject, and that may be true in many cases.  however, i see multiple posts on reddit about people asking for advice on how to deal with their parent's situation and i've learned from what happened to us as well ...

my dad died suddenly at age 66.  he was always good with money and we lived comfortably and somewhat frugally.  as my parents got older, i tried gently prodding financial insights from them - did they have life insurance, are all the bills covered, does my mom get dad's pension if he goes first.  my dad was never comfortable discussing any of these things.  when he died, my mom was clueless, and everything was left to me to figure out.  clearly my dad should have talked to her, if not to me, but i was in a much better position to deal with everything even though i had to figure out the information with nothing to go on.

this morning my husband's single mom calls us in tears saying that she can't travel to visit us this year because she is broke.  my husband grew up relatively poor, but she had married a few times in her 50s and was actually given a $250k settlement from her ex-husband, about 3 years ago.  somehow she has blown through this and doesn't earn enough from ss to cover her basic bills.  if she had only talked to us when she got that settlement i could have helped her plan a way to make it last - we had no idea she received this money nor that she was living so close to the edge.

too little, too late in both these situations and yet, my husband and i are being called in to help.  death is inevitable, money is necessary, i wish my family had not felt these were taboo topics until it was too late.

edit:  well this blew up ... as many have realized, yes, i was talking about adult children in particular based on the experiences of myself, friends and colleagues being unpleasantly surprised by parental circumstances and then not being in a position to do anything about it.  of course, as a parent, use your discretion on kids of any age - still lessons to be learned, just not in the ways many have described below.",10
"had an interview, had me pay for the flight, said they'd reimburse me, they have yet to pay me. i had an interview for a company on may 18th, i have email correspondence that says they want me to buy the flight to the interview as they do not want my personal information or to mess up the flight scheduling, but they will reimburse me for the flights cost. whatever, figure that's a normal~ish thing to occur. i go to the interview and we we are not on the same wavelength, so i knew it wasn't going to work out as did they. 

i called them two weeks ago and asked when i was going to get reimbursed for my flight, they said they were still working on it. 

is there a specific time i should wait for this reimbursement? what are the steps i should take if they just never send anything back to me? 

maybe i'm overreacting, but i gave them the price of my flight well before i even went to the interview, so they've known the cost of it for nearly two months now. just seems a little off to me.

edit 1. sent an email out to the person i was in correspondence with previously asking for an eta. will update on how she responds. 

edit 2. because of some comments made i'll clarify some things. i've already accepted a position at a different company. i heard about this company through my friend who was trying to do business with them. so can't exactly burn bridges here, but am more than willing to write a glassdoor review on the interview process if this drags on.

"my boss offered my friend a $6 raise, after only giving me a $1.5 raise. how do i ask for more money?. i have been working for the same company for 2 years now. every year you make at the company you have a review where you get a raise. only people that work ""full time"" are eligible. 

the first year that i was working there, i was working ""part-time"", which really just means i didn't have benefits, because i was still working almost 40 hours a week. i started working ""full time"" when i made my first year, which meant that i did not get a review for my entire full year. it's been a year of me being full time and i had my first review and i left with a $1.5 raise. 

a couple of months ago i referred my friend to the job because we were short people. long story short she has been here 5 months, and she found/was offered a job at another office for $6 more an hour. when she put in her two weeks to leave for the new job, my current boss counter offered her to match the pay for her to stay. so now my friend who has only been working there for less than 6 months got a $6 raise, while i only got a $1.5 raise after two years of working for this company. 

while i'm really happy for my friend (i'm not blaming her at all), i can't help but to feel cheated and undervalued by the company. we technically have the same job, (but i'm practically managing my own office alone) and i don't know what to do or how to handle this situation. 

do i ask my boss to match her pay? how would i even bring that up? what if she says no? i'm just really lost as to what my next steps are..

"demoted today with a $9k pay cut - what are my options?. background: i've been with my current employer for almost 4 years. i was hired as a service techinician (servicing/installing bank equipment - locks, safes, pneumatic tube systems, burg/fire alarms, cctv, etc) and was promoted to service manager jan 1 2018.

i'm the third person to take (and now lose) this job since i've worked there - it's a small company of 6 employees, and the boss is a hothead and very hard to please. i knew this going in, but i figured for the money it was worth an attempt.

i was making $19/hr hourly working full time before, changed to $50k/yr salary once i took the manager job.

today, i had a pretty bullshit ""6 month review"" - he sat me down and basically said, ""i don't think this is working, so i'm making you a tech again, i'll pay you $20/hr. take the rest of today and tomorrow off, come wednesday we'll get you rolling in the field again."" he has his reasons, and i don't disagree that there were challenges in working together - but nothing was ever documented on paper, i would just have to sit through angry outbursts once in a while every time he didn't like the way i did something. most critically, i just took a $9000 dollar pay cut - having just purchased a car, and this puts a huge crunch on my finances. i'm going to spend some time today redoing my budget, and i already don't like how it's going to turn out.

here are my thoughts. if i stay here, that management experience withers away, and loses effectiveness on my resume the longer i continue as a technician.

going back to work there is going to be awkward. that much i can manage, but i see it causing some interpersonal drama now that i'm back working alongside 4 techs i was previously in charge of.

lastly, would this qualify as constructive dismissal? i understand that my job duties are changing as well as my pay - but this is an 18% pay cut that was decided unilaterally. would i be better served declining it and accepting dismissal, trying to survive off of unemployment while searching for something in the vain of what i was previously doing?

this is the first time something like this has happened to me, and while my head is spinning a little, i feel like i can make the best of the situation somehow - just need a little guidance.

i appreciate in advance any advice you can offer - and if there are any questions you have for me i'm happy to answer them.",10
"employer offering to pay my student loan instead of contributing to my 401k. yesterday my employer let us know that they will be offering a new program in january. instead of matching up to 6% of our salaries in 401k contributions, we will have the option to put that money toward student loans. i currently have about 33k left and with regular monthly payments of $470, they will be paid off in roughly 6.5 years. i can currently add about $500 to the monthly payment, and at that rate, they will be paid off in ~2.5 years. using my employer's new program, i could have them paid off in ~18 months.  

my 401k will be at about 12k by the end of the year. i make 50k, so the annual contribution between my self and my employer is 6k. that 6k over 40 years will be worth ~60k at least. short-term, it would be nice to pay off my loans a year earlier, but long-term, my 401k loses a pretty big chunk of money. is this a good assessment?

"single dad w/ 4 kids, live with family for help with kids. my kids mother never contributed, but passed a few weeks ago, we now qualify for about $1k a month in social security.. i've posted numerous times and have always received great advice, so i want to say thank you in advance. so 2 years ago i separated with my wife and moved back to my home town with my mother/sister/grandparents because i needed help with my kids. i was unemployed and incredibly depressed, i took a job making $13 an hour, and i received a couple of raises and promotions for working hard and what not. last may after a bunch of great advice from this sub i'm now making close to $50k a year (with over time).  because we live with family we don't have many living expenses, and over the last 2 years i've paid off over 25k of debt, my credit score went from 590 to 720, and my only remaining debt are my federal student loans. my emergency fund is at about 3 months, and i have over 10k in credit cards if ever needed. to be honest i've been spending money kinda frivolously because i was going through a divorce and now because she passed away (retail therapy i guess). 

because of her passing we'll now receive about 1k a month in survivor benefits, and i don't know how to plan for that. i could very quickly save up to buy a house right now, but i don't know if that should be a priority because to be honest i still need help with my children, and there are so many other living expenses i'd absorb. also we currently live in a suburb and i don't know if i could afford to live in the area and keep my kids in the same school. part of me feel like i should just leave that money separate and start college funds for all my kids. also i'm 33 and don't have much saved for retirement. my 401k isn't even a year old and i'm only contributing 5% a month. 

i've made a ton of steps in the right direction, and i want to stay on track. any advice would be appreciated. ",10
"life on a budget. i am in a great mood today and want to try to spread some confidence. i know life can be hard, and finances makes it a lot harder than it has to be. my wife, myself, and our 3 month old baby live on a single income with no assistance other than renting a house that is based on my income. i make about $33,000 a year with base salary, benefits, and commissions. yes, we may not be in the best situation, and we don't have the most or nicest things, but even with our low income it's still possible for us to live, and even save! we pay close to $300 extra on my car every month and expect to pay it off next summer 3 years short of maturity. most importantly though, we are happy.

i'm no expert, and nowhere near perfect but here are some tips i have for budgeting:

* actually do it every month, there is no way you can just copy and paste it from month to month
* keep it simple, we like to line item everything we have, instead of food $600 we have groceries $300, monthly restaurant $26, emergency fast food $30, farm produce $24, and so on. when you have a small line item you are more careful with what you have on paper
* keep an overflow, but not too much. we usually keep about $50 each month for that inevitable ""oh no, i forgot i need an oil change!"" once you get really good at planning you won't need it as much, but that peace of mind makes budgeting seem easy.
* trust your budget. once you get it down don't hold your payments until the last second, just mail that check!

if we can do it, anyone can do it! you just have to believe in yourself and stick to your plan. nail that budget down, eat at home as much as possible, be thrifty, and learn to say no to that new tv. you guys got this, together we can all win at this money thing!

edit: thank you for all of your kind words! a few people have asked for me to lay out the budget so here it is https://imgur.com/a/osmdh3e(https://imgur.com/a/osmdh3e) . this month is a pretty big month for commissions so we decided to have a bit of fun and buy a few things that we've been wanting for a few months. the non-recurring stuff is most of that, and we are going to go on our first date since the baby so we pumped the restaurant budget up a tiny bit. it's important to have a bit of fun from time to time!

edit 2: i use everydollar to budget. i used mint for a little while but i found everydollar to be easier to use. linking your bank account seems like a good idea, but in my experience having the delay hurt me a lot, so i ended up manually entering everything anyway.

edit 3: a few faqs. 

* how do you get internet for $4.99 a month? i work for an isp and reimbursed for the majority of it. the mobile phone is also mostly paid for by my employer which is why it's so cheap for 2 lines. both of these were factored into my benefits.
* how is your rent and utilities so cheap? i live in tennessee which i think is one of the cheapest places to live in america. the duplex we live in is normally $564 a month, but it is based on income so we pay $444. electricity is the only thing we have to pay for in it because there is no gas, and each duplex shares a water meter, so they can't split it between the 2 units. the place isn't very nice i'm not going to lie, but until i can get my income up we're going to stay here and save as much as we can.
* why dota 2? because it's fun, and i like the tracking that comes with dota plus subscription.
* how do you eat so cheap? my wife is extraordinarily good at shopping for deals, aldi is great if you live near one! we eat different stuff every week because she only buys stuff that is on sale. we eat well and healthy too, tonight we had pork chops and brussels sprouts. also small stuff like buying whole chickens and cutting them yourself saves quite a bit of money. we spend about $20 for 4 chickens, which is about 6 meals worth of meat.

edit 4: thank you kind stranger for the gold! in true dota fashion thanks for the gold!(https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/b/b9/wind_lasthit_07.mp3)",10

"encouragement it sucks but paying down debt is a good way to avoid spending money on stupid stuff.. the short is that my wife and i were making over $120k. i drove a stupid expensive truck and she needed to quit her job.

cut to late last year where i ditched my truck for an electric vehicle saving a combined $500+/ month gas and payments. she quite her job and got $5k in back pay, the ev tax credit yielded me a $6.5 tax return and my work bonus was $3k.

we also heavily reorganized our finances, changed insurance providers,  and got our spending under major control. we were never at risk when she was working, but we ate out too much and spent too much money on junk.

we took this ""windfall"" $14k and sat on it as it came in across jan/feb/mar. i watched our savings grow past our emergency fund limit and everytime i had the urge to go out and upgrade my vehicle again i would pay off a student loan. i just made another payment and feel proud that i am working to dig out of the hole instead of digging deeper in.

anyone struggling out there, when you get money don't do what you want to, do what you need to. i am confident that buying that vehicle wouldn't have truly negatively affected me, but the loan is something i won't be living with and that will be unequivocally the better life option.

thanks for reading as i still fight the emotional feeling if wanting my expensive luxury truck i can no longer afford a down payment on.",10
"please stop suggesting mechanical turk to people in financial need. its a horrible waste of time.. almost every time i see a post for someone requesting a way to earn some extra money to cover some bills there are a half dozen people suggesting that they sign up for amazon mechanical turk and they can earn a couple hundred a month.

this is completely untrue and people that never tried this website need to stop suggesting it. it is an utter waste of someone's time. 

a few years ago i found myself at home unable to find work and unable to get out and look for work in a brick and mortar setting. it was due to health problems with a family member and i was pretty desperate to earn some money.

i will tell you what things have gone back to this and right now i am going through the same thing and when i see people suggest mechanical turk i can only believe they never tried it.


first of all you have to understand that much of the work in the hits they give you is not really related to honest work. much of it is psychological profiling and testing and as you will see some of it is not even available to you because they are targeting very specific groups. more so you will find that the hits that are available often pay about 10 cents us or less and take you 15 minutes or so to perform. many are looking at someone's website to find mistakes, some are looking at images and sorting them and others are just so random you can't really understand why anyone wants this stuff done.. but heck if you can fork out $5 and have 500 of these things going does it matter?


so my experience is very poor with mturk

i do understand though that some people .. very very few people that to private work through mturk do get paid a bit more. you have to be pre-approved to do this work. its not open to everyone and the few hits of this type that i was approved for to do some writing were unjustifiably difficult to get paid for.


my earnings back a couple years

http://i.imgur.com/uehew9m.png


examples of hits you can earn.. look how little they pay 

3 cents for 20 minutes

1 cent for 5 minutes

http://i.imgur.com/aoeidon.png


highest paid hits are very unique .. and they are asking you to do stuff thats not quite on the up and up.. asking you to look for movies and use your internet account .. be on a specific cable provider.. then show them a screenshot of the movie.. wth

you just can not earn money on mechanical turk

how are you going to spend 10 minutes earning 3 cents? 

this is worse than what they pay people in india.. these hits are probably indian companies hiring american workers that they put out of work to do their jobs for pennies...

i mean really .. more than happy to make money helping companies this way but its got to pay more than 10 cents an hour...

http://i.imgur.com/hgzz0u7.png

the highest paid hits are transcriptions of 2 hour movies.. wow thats a ton of work for $35

by the second page all of the hits that are sorted high to low are down in the sub $1 area and taking an hour or much longer... 

example one is.. post 10 videos of yourself.. we will pay you 75cents... ok but then you also have a high probability of having these hits rejected. or reused in ways you don't want to think about.. 

from my experience mechanical turk is not a honest place to earn any amount of extra cash.. sure you might make something and i did after months i made like $20 but it is such an utter waste of your time.. you would be better off just sleeping or cleaning your home or anything more productive than trying to earn money on this site.

that is my experience and i really wish it wasn't.

please stop suggesting this site for people in financial need.. you can not earn anything substantial from it.....

you would be better off putting up a blog about your dog and throwing adsense ads on it... honestly",10
"don't use debit cards at the gas pump -- or anywhere. it's best not to use a debit card at all, if you can help it.

card readers grab data off a credit or debit card's magnetic strip without your knowledge, with some pump skimming devices being capable of stealing debit card pins as well. it's a good idea to avoid paying with a debit card at the pump. armed with your pin and debit card data, thieves can clone the card and pull money out of your account at an atm.

that's one reason, generally, why security and fraud experts recommend paying with a credit card over a debit card: if you use a credit card, you're not actually spending your money, and you're protected by your issuer's zero-liability policy. when your debit card transactions are approved, the money is taken out of your account then and there. if a fraudster took the funds, you then have to wait for their recovery and return, which could take days or weeks. credit cards can also potentially earn you rewards on gas purchases, depending on which one you use.

some newer pumps may include more mobile payment options like apple pay, samsung pay or android pay, which don't require the customer to share credit or debit information with the station at all. if you use a mobile payment service that's enabled at a gas station your frequent, opt for that payment method over your card. in general, newer pumps are going to be more secure for payments than older pumps.

https://twocents.lifehacker.com/dont-use-a-debit-card-at-the-gas-pump-1832796443(https://twocents.lifehacker.com/dont-use-a-debit-card-at-the-gas-pump-1832796443)

edit: big misunderstanding here. both debit and credit cards in the us have chips which are more secure against skimming. however, many if not most gas pumps around the us have not been updated with the modern chip readers and therefore people who pay with a card at the dated pumps only have the option to slide their card through the reader. this makes both credit and debit cards susceptible to skimming. credit cards are not immune from skimming. credit cards are more protective against the effects of fraudulent charges on your account.",10

**2018 year in review:**

- earned all-time high annual net income

- invested 50% of my net income this year, setting new records for both cumulative (total dollars) and quantitative (% of net income) annual investing rate. running annual average rate is 30%.

- spent 25% net income on living expenses, 25% on recreational expenses, 0% on debt this year. running annual average rates are now 35%, 24%, 10% respectively.

- suffered significant damage to my average roi (-37%) thanks to crypto market volatility

- net worth flat lined this year as decreasing value of taxable assets were offset by increasing estimated present value of pension.

**2019 goals:**

- invest 45% of my net income.

- spend 25% of my net income on recreational/fun activities.

- keep living expenses below 30% of my net income.

- lick my wounds and hopefully recover some of my roi.

"today i paid off the remainder of my $37000 student loan. originally had a 10 year term but i paid it off in 4. i saved roughly $8000 in interest fees.. 4 years of being out of school and today i had a bit of extra money in my bank account, so i made a lump sum payment and paid off the remaining balance of my loan.  it feels really good.

i used a loan calculator to determine the cost of borrowing for my original 10 year repayment term vs the 4 year term that i ended up with.  there's a difference of about $8000.  that's $8000 that i would have handed over to the bank over the next 6 years had i just made the minimum payments on my loan.

it's something to think about for those of you with loans.  one dollar spent now is one dollar with interest compounded over the remaining life of your loan that you don't have to give away to the bank.  with that thought in the back of my mind, i've been making the decision to delay gratification and pay off my loans with my extra spending money every paycheque. 

i would recommend to people with loans to put a small amount of extra money into your loan every time you get paid.  it doesn't have to be much, maybe only $20-50 if you can afford it, but it does wonders to decreasing the term length of your loan, which in turn saves you a lot of money in the end.

edit: quick note because a lot of people are asking, but my interest rate on the loan was 6.5%. i also have an employer-matched pension that i pay into every month. i think i'd be hard pressed to find an investment with better than a 6.5% guaranteed return.  

edit 2: i work as a physiotherapist, and annually i earn 65-70k, with a take home of about ~~35k.~~50k.",10

"(ro) disabled and broke. no clue where to go.. hey guys. i've hit nearly rock bottom and i need your help. i'm 21 and live in romania. in the 2010s, i've developed muscular dystrophy, which confined me permanently to a wheelchair. but of course, it doesn't stop there. the various apartment buildings
in my city have no elevators whatsoever, but they all have stairs, so i'm stuck inside unless carried out and that's not an option since it's pure agony on my back.

this wasn't the end of it though, because around the same time my mother has developed paranoid schizophrenia and became completely irresponsible, taking out large loans from all sorts of firms to get 4-star vacations. she went to malta, greece and paris (twice), accumulating a huge pile of debt. she's retired early, so she only gets a piddly little pension and she's a chain-smoker, smoking 3 packs a day which adds even more financial strain.

i only get a disability pension which isn't that much and my father is a cab driver who works for a patron. he works from 5 am to 8 pm and doesn't make a lot. none of this is enough for the massive pile of debt, we live practically check-to-check nowadays.

i want to do something, get a job, make some money and help in putting all of this behind us and moving out so i don't have to stay with my mother, who has completely ruined us. but i don't have any skills, i barely learned anything in the rare home schooled classes i took. and i think i might be suffering from depression, i can't bring any focus or motivation to bear. i try to do some programming or focus on studying systems administration and i can barely focus without my thoughts drifting or switching to doing something else (reddit, fanfiction, youtube). but the others things i do aren't any more compelling. even my favorite hobby (gaming) doesn't entertain me. i just feel... empty and so, so tired. i don't even remember what it feels like to be happy any more.

sorry if i've been rambling or incoherent, but this is the first time i've got all this out. not sure if posting all this was a good idea, or if this even is the right subreddit for it, but i don't really have anything left to lose. any ideas, guys?",10
"true cost of raising a child: $245,340 national average (not including college). i'm 30/f and of course the question of whether or not i want to have kids eventually is looming over me. 

i got to wondering how much it actually costs to raise a kid to 18 and thought i'd share what i found, especially since i see a lot of ""we just had a baby what should we expect?"" questions posted here.

true cost of raising a child (http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/cities/cost-raising-child/). it's based on the 2013 usda report(http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/expenditures_on_children_by_families/crc2013.pdf) but takes into account cost of living in various cities. the national average is **$245,340**. here in oakland, ca it comes out closer to $337,477!! and this is only to 18, not including cost of college which we all know is getting more and more expensive.

then this other article(http://www.todaysparent.com/family/family-budget/million-dollar-babies/) goes into more of the details of other costs, saying ""ward pegs the all-in cost of raising a child to 18 in the u.s. at around $700,000, or closer to $900,000 to age 22""

i don't know how you parents do it, this seems like an insane amount to me!

i also found this usda cost of raising a child calculator(http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/calculatorintro.htm) which lets you get more granular and input the number of children, number of parents, region, and income. afterwards you can also customize how much you expect to pay for housing, food, transportation, clothing, health, care, child care and education, and other: ""if your yearly expenses are different than average, you can type in your actual expense for a specific budgetary component by just going to calculator results, typing in your actual expenses on the results table, and hitting the recalculate button.""

**edit 2**: also note that the estimated expense is based on a child born in 2013. i'm sure plenty of people are/were raised on less but i still find it useful to think about.

**edit 3**: a lot of people are saying the number is bs, but it seems totally plausible to me when i break it down actually.. i know someone who is giving his ex $1,100/mo in child support. kid is currently 2 yrs old. by 18 that comes out to $237,600. that's pretty close to the estimate. 

**edit 4**: wow, i really did not expect this to blow up as much as it did. i just thought it was an interesting article. but wanted to add a couple of additional thoughts since i can't reply to everyone...

a couple of parents have said something along the lines of ""if you're pricing it out, you probably shouldn't have a kid anyways because the joy of parenthood is priceless."" this seems sort of weird to me, because having kids is obviously a huge commitment. i think it's fair to try and understand what you might be getting into and try to evaluate what changes you'd need to make in order to raise a child before diving into it. of course i know plenty of people who weren't planning on having kids but accidentally did anyways and make it work despite their circumstances. but if i was going to have a kid i'd like to be somewhat prepared financially to provide for them.

the estimate is high and i was initially shocked by it, but it hasn't entirely deterred me from possibly having a kid still. just makes me think hard about what it would take.",10
"a warning about the sim swap scam. many of you may know what the sim swap scam is, however, i did not, and unfortunately, i got the opportunity to learn the hard way on christmas eve. if you're not going to read the rest of this, here's the quick take-away: if you unexpectedly receive a text message from your mobile carrier providing you with a pin, do not ignore it. call your provider immediately and take action because someone is likely trying to gain temporary access to your number (or someone else's on your plan) and the damage they can cause is far-reaching.

my wife and i began receiving texts and voicemail from t-mobile on christmas eve morning. the texts would include one-time pins, and the voicemail was from t-mobile representatives apologizing for getting disconnected. each time, we would call t-mobile and speak to a representative and inform them that someone was trying to gain access to our account. and each time, the representative would assure us that there is no way it would happen due to the notes and flags they were putting on our account. i was even laughed at the 4th time i called when i got put on the line with the same representative i spoke to the 2nd time, as she thought it was silly that i was so concerned. when i asked why this person would be working so hard just to swap a sim, i was told it was probably so he/she could make international calls on our account. 
on our 5th call, in the middle of anther one of these assurance speeches, it happened. my wife's phone lost service. i interrupted the t-mobile representative and informed her, who in disbelief began the process of routing the sim back to my wife's phone. roughly 5 minutes later my wife is back online, but there's a big problem: she can no longer sign in to our wells fargo account. that's when it clicked for us: he spent all day trying to get access, got turned down countless times until one bad t-mobile representative granted his request, just so that he could use our number to reset our wells fargo password. the fact that it was christmas eve evening when it all went down likely wasn't a coincidence either as wells fargo and t-mobile storefronts were all closed, and getting help wasn't easy. 
fortunately, we caught it just in time and we were able to get wells fargo on the phone and our accounts locked down. the only actions he was able to take was to move money across multiple accounts into one, with the intention of making an atm withdrawal (according to a wells fargo employee familiar with this scam).
we spent the better part of the day after christmas undoing the damage: closing and opening wells fargo accounts, turning back on online access, switching mobile providers, …etc. i'm left feeling vulnerable. despite all our calls and our warnings to t-mobile, they still let the fraudster in. immediately after we locked down our wells fargo account, as in not even 2 minutes afterwards, i was back on the phone with t-mobile, because they had ""someone on the line who wants to swap sim cards and i just need to get your permission to go ahead"". i felt helpless because obviously t-mobile was doing nothing to prevent this from happening. when i suggested that we shut the whole thing down and cancel our t-mobile account entirely, going without service for the remainder of christmas eve and christmas day, i was informed that while our representative could do that, she couldn't ensure that the fraudster wouldn't be able to call in and turn everything back on. 
we ended up making it out okay, and it appears that after the fraudster realized he wasn't going to get anything out of our wells fargo accounts, he moved on. i'm not sure at all that switching to a new carrier will prevent this from happening, but due to t-mobile's response, or the absolute lack-there-of, i felt i had no choice. i want to make others aware of this as we might have had more options had we known what was going to happen when we first started receiving unexpected texts and voicemail from t-mobile. please do take it very serious and act quickly if you suspect this is happening to you.

"ficos are beginning to become arbitrary. i work in automotive lending for a major automotive lender. with increased technology, credit swipes, credit boosts, authorized user credit, and  just straight fraud, ficos are starting to become unreliable. below is an example of what i'm referring to: 

yesterday i had two separate applications that stood out.

customer a: credit had a perfect paid auto, 3-4 perfect paid credit cards, 1 perfect paid installment loan and a student loan that had 1 payment over 30 days past due, the rest were perfect. 

customer b: had 15 credit cards, most had at least 2-5 over 30 days past due, a prior bankruptcy, a prior auto loss, a couple installment loans paid slow and they were currently 6 months past due on their mortgage. 

customer a: 389 fico

customer b: 708 fico 

both were trying to get a similar style car around 30k, it was affordable for both. one got approved the other did not. the 389 fico was approved, 708 rejected. 

customer a's fico was so low because in their specific circumstance their student loan counted 24 times. as a lender and someone with student loans myself i understand that most likely they just missed 1 total payment. 

i bring this up to make a point to stop worrying about what your fico number is, and instead worry about what makes up your credit. pay your major credit first: autos/mortgages. if you're going to be late on something, do it on something not detrimental to your finances (like a low interest student loan). have individual credit, don't rely on parents/partners credit cards to boost your score, we see it and know you do it, and don't try to cheat the system. there are tons of people like me who look at credit all day every day, we know what to look for and generally can play the game better than most. 

i say all this with the caveat that some banks have not gone away from using the fico as an end all be all. it's still important for determining rate tiers. however most are starting to learn the tricks. i would not be surprised if in the coming years a fico score becomes irrelevant. so instead of trying to inflate your score, just work on paying the important things on time every time.

"target charged me a $3.18 without explanation. check your cc statements.. i was checking my credit card statement this morning and i saw a charge i made at target.com for a christmas present but right next to it was another charge from target for $3.18.  i called their customer service number to ask what the charge was.  i gave them my previous order number and they said the total cost of the order was the exact difference from what i received in my email.  so i have an email saying the price was $122.16 but then they just decided ""nope, changed our minds.  price will now be $125.34."" and made a separate charge to make up the difference without any notification.  they said as a ""one time courtesy"" that they would refund me the difference but could not explain to me where it came from (shipping?  tax?).  just a warning for those of you out there because i wonder how many of these small charges fall through the cracks.

edit: some extra details.  target confirmed that they made the charge (though the call center rep couldn't tell me why) so it's not a spoofed charge to check if my cc is valid.  my confirmation email from them includes tax and notes that shipping is free.  so it's not an adjustment for sales tax.  if they did need to charge me for shipping after all, they should at least send me an email asking if that's okay or if i want to cancel the order.

"buying a house ""responsibly"" impossible for many?. so i've been doing some back of the envelope math, and am thinking that if you live in the west coast, northeast, chicago, honolulu, or denver, you need to be literally made of money and sweat solid gold to ever even dream of home ownership.   

so where i live, of the three city / county areas i'd want to live to not be an hour away from work, and even looking primarily in areas with bad schools for...reasons, the average house cost is $500k for a wwii era run-down shoebox of around 1200 square feet.  and we don't even crack the top 10 list of most expensive areas!

going by pf logic, i then need:

* 20% downpayment = $100k
* 3% closing costs = $15k
* 1% of the cost of the house annually for repairs = $5000
* property tax, school tax, asshole tax, you-lookin'-at-me-kid tax, etc:  $925 a month or $11k annually
* mortgage payment and insurance: $2500 per month or $30k annually

then you need 6-12 months of expenses saved for an emergency fund.  so call it 12 to be safe, and we need $30k mortgage + $11k taxes + $5k repairs + $36k other living expenses = $81k.  

so let's add all these up and see how much we have to save before we can buy our first (crappy, 1200 sq ft, wwii era) house!  

$100k down payment + $81k emergency fund + $15k closing costs + $5k repair costs = **$201k**.  just to get in the door and still owe $400k!  

let's say the average person can save 10% of their monthly after-tax income.  how long does somebody have to save before they can responsibly dream of owning a house?  


* let's say you make the us median of ~$50k.  at $50k salary = $35k take home = $3500 annually — a mere **54 years**!
* oh, well, what if you make more?  how about $75k, the median for an individual with a doctorate degree?  **38 years**.
* or what if you have an mba and make the median $100k that folk with professional degrees make?  **29 years**.
* what if you're in the top 1.5% for income and make $200k annually?  **11 years!**

even if you can save 20% of your after-tax income, you'll just cut these numbers in half.  

what is the average time before changing jobs?  well if you're above 25 and relatively stable, between 70%-87% of people will still change jobs within 5 years.  so you're between 10% and 45% of your house-saving goal by the time you'll get a new job and have to relocate anyways.  

conclusion:  homeownership in highly populated / coastal areas is essentially impossible for 99% of the population to strive for ""responsibly.""  

judging by the numerous all-cash no contingencies offers the crappy shoeboxes all around me get within 48 hours of listing, i'm going to hazard a guess that either nobody is buying a home ""responsibly"" or the rich are buying up literally every property everywhere and we're all doomed to be serfs to wealthy landowners forevermore.  and that is my cheerful thought of the day!  :-d

"50k in debt - accepted an offer at a higher paying job but failed background test due to bad credit - now unemployed and scared of the future.. please help me, this subreddit has always given me hope that it is possible to rebuild but i don't know what to do anymore. i ask that you please provide sound advice to get through this and not scold me for my mistakes; i've had a couple nervous breakdowns this week.

&#x200b;

i left a job that offered me a promotion (to avoid burning bridges) because the company i interviewed with extended me an offer. the difference in pay between the two companies was roughly 30k and the role was a step in the right direction for me career-wise.

&#x200b;

i never thought my bad credit would get in the way of getting me a job and grossly assumed that because i don't have a criminal record that i would move forward.

&#x200b;

long story short i hit a rough patch early in 2018 and wasnt able to pay my credit cards (they went to collections). i'm 30k in the hole in cc debt and 20k in student loans. even though i knew this was ruining my credit i figured if i worked hard, pay for the essentials to live (rent,food, car insurance,utilities, medical bills) and land high paying job that i would be able to get back on track.

&#x200b;

i finally landed that job, accepted the offer only to be told a few weeks later that because of my credit history they would not move forward with me. this broke me.

&#x200b;

not only did i leave a job that offered me a promotion but now i no longer have an income. i've already asked for my job back but have been told their isnt a spot for me there anymore.

&#x200b;

i've been aggressively applying to other jobs in hopes of finding something fast but also terrified that i will run into the same issue again.

&#x200b;

i have 4k left for me to survive. i started consulting again with a company i used to work with in the past (25 hourly) to earn some kind of income; the problem is that its only a few hours a week.

i don't know what to do, and i'm getting desperate. ",10
"macy's shoes broke after two weeks of regular usage. they won't return them ; can i issue a chargeback?. hello pf, i bought some shoes from macy's, they broke after two weeks of use. the warranty at macy's is 180 days, but when i tried to return them (with the receipt), they told me they don't have returns for broken products. i didn't wear them through a swamp or anything; they're dress shoes, and the laces snapped, back of the heel wore out, and the shoe separated from the bottom after two weeks of regular usage. 

if macy's will not issue a return, can i file for a chargeback under 'not as described'(https://chargebacks911.com/knowledge-base/product-not-as-described-chargebacks/), since these were sold as regular dress shoes? would this affect my credit, and how long would it take for a return? or am i better off just eating the purchase and buying elsewhere.

thanks so much for your advice.


edit: thanks again everyone for your input, i appreciate it. for everyone wondering, these(https://www.macys.com/shop/product/alfani-mens-turner-chukka-boot-created-for-macys?id=4876085) are the shoes in question. i get that they're cheap shoes, but they were $45 when i got them, and they're falling apart after 2 weeks. it looks like the consensus is to go back, re-iterate my case with someone above the shoe department person, then take a trip to /r/malefashionadvice/.


update: good news everyone! the manager processed my return. frustrating it took a half hour of my time, but here we are. learned a few good finance lessons:

1. don't buy at macy's
2. don't buy cheap shoes 2-3 times a year ; buy a good pair once every five years
3. ask for the manager.

"countering the ""rent is just throwing away money"" meme.. hello wonderful pf community. this is in partial response to yesterday's top post entitled ""buying a house 'responsibly' impossible for many?"". while this was a great post, i'd like to point out that renting isn't half bad for what you get. a rent payment doesn't *just* cover the roof over your head. you also get:

- included appliances, such as stove, dishwasher, fridge, laundry units, etc. this could cost thousands of dollars out of your pocket when you own. to not only buy the equipment up front, but also repair them.

- lawn care. you either have to buy your own mower upfront and be out in the hot sun for two hours every saturday, or pay a lawn guy. 

-  amenities. if your rental has a pool, gym, etc. you might pay a slight premium in rent for all of these, but the value is still there. gym memberships are *costly* these days. pool ownership and maintenance is a *hassle* (any current owners know this is true). 

- above all else, flexibility to move at basically anytime, so long as you have the cash on hand to buy out of your lease. with a house you have to factor in: possibly being underwater if you don't have enough equity, the extreme length of the sales process (even in a good market it could take up to a year!), and in a worst case scenario not even being able to sell it. i'm sure everyone already saw the ""leave your current job every 5 years or so to get a significant raise"" post. what if the next great opportunity is across the country? ya never know.

all this is *not* to say that renting beats homeownership. certainly the huge advantage of having no mortgage payment at the end of your 30 years (or however long) is great. but you have to do it right to make it work. just hoping to change the minds of some ""rent averse"" people!

edit 1: also property taxes!

edit 2: it's been pointed out that if you rent a *house* rather than an apartment that some of these perks wouldn't be included. but you also get more square footage and more freedom (not having to worry about pet regulations, not having neighbors literally on top of you, etc.)",10

some relevant details: 

1. the state school would cost me ~20k a year after the merit-based scholarship i will receive from the school itself and financial aid. this price includes housing, tuition, books, and food. i would need to find somewhere to live during summer, though.

2. it will only take me 6 semesters to achieve my degree because i have taken prerequisite college courses online.

3. as of right now, i am about to finish my junior year and have a part-time job where i average about 20 hours a week, however, there are no extra hours available. 

4. senior year i will be getting out of school early (about noon), so i could get a second job and work full time.

5. the way my state/university is laid out i will more or less need to buy a car, so i intend to buy a used car at the end of summer (i have about 2,000 saved right now).

6. my grades (top 5% of class) and test scores are good (99.5 percentile) however i am not eligible for need-based scholarships.

which leads to my questions: 

what actions should i be taking now in order to prepare for what's to come? 

is it possible for a teenager to get a job paying more than minimum wage, if so how and where?

what can i do to lessen the costs of college (i've taken all 100 & 200 level courses at community college already so it is not possible for me to go to community college first)? 

what are some costs i should be prepared for?

"heads up: fannie mae will now be buying and accepting loans made with one credit report frozen. if you are worried about your credit info being breached but didn't freeze all three agencies, do that now.. **why this is important:**
with the recent equifax breach, plenty of people have put freezes on their credit reports (for good reason). but if you only froze one, someone can now still take out a loan on your name if they have the rest of your info. 


**what changed:**
until recently, fannie mae required all three credit reports to actually report for them to buy a loan from a bank. the change now allows for your report to be frozen with one credit reporting agency, but the other two must be unfrozen. 

**why this matters:**
your local bank might sell the mortgages they originate to fannie mae. many small and even moderately sized banks have investors they sell mortgages to. fannie mae is one of the largest investors here. the loan must be originated and underwritten to fannie mae's standards for them to purchase it. this means that fannie mae's guidelines impact your local banks' guidelines if they sell to them. this change means that other banks will now be allowing this same thing. so if you're worried about your credit but didn't freeze it with all three agencies, do that now. 


edit: source—i'm a technical writer at a bank and am rewriting our internal procedures on what we accept based on the above as i type this. 

edit 2: i'm not suggesting fannie mae originates loans. the thing is that their decisions as an investor will impact how banks do business. fannie mae says they'll take loans that are riskier? banks that sell to fannie mae will start originating those riskier loans because they know they can sell them. this is about fannie mae (being a large investor) saying they'll take loans with one frozen score, so some banks will start accepting that too and not require that it be unfrozen. all i was saying was, if you were concerned but thought freezing one or two was good enough, that's not necessarily the case.

"got $65 in dental fees waived just by calling.. i received a bill from my dentist several months after my last appointment for $65. i called them and they said they were for x-ray fees which my insurance didn't cover because it hadn't been enough time since my previous x-ray. i explained that i'd never requested an x-ray or been asked when my last one was, i was simply told that i needed an x-ray. long story short, they ended up waiving the fee. it's always worth calling about unexpected fees!

"sorry guys, i can't keep doing this.. as a background, i am a 29 year old married man who made some terrible financial decisions that left me with a large student loan, high car payments, 26k in medical debt, and several thousand in credit card debt.

for the last few years, my wife and i have employed the hardcore mindset of personalfinance:  have an emergency fund, put every dime you have towards debt, and grind until it's gone.  i took this to heart.  we have a decent savings, we nearly eliminated our entertainment budget(thanks netflix!), i got in shape, we made money on the side(working the flea every weekend), and we made slow but steady progress.

i am proud to say that as of last month, i have completely eliminated all my short-term debts.  my car, my medical debt, all my credit card debt, is officially at zero. 

however, i still have 86k in student loans.  i am now almost 30, married, and living in an apartment.  

after all my bills(including rent/student loans) my wife an i have a monthly surplus of 2.5k usd.  

i know the right thing is to continue putting every dime i have left over into student loans, but i can't do it anymore.  for the last several years our lives have been putting every cent i have towards debt.  it's been painful and boring, and the only thing that kept me going is the joy of seeing those debts get knocked off one by one.  all free time has been netflix, gaming, and working the flea market on weekends to pay off this debt.

after several years, i am tired, stressed, and feel like my life is going nowhere. i have been a slave to the results of my bad decisions and debt.  all my student loans add up to $600/month.  i can live with $600/month of my salary going to student loans, but i can't live the next three years of my life in this shitty apartment putting my dreams of a house and family/kids on hold.

i've done my budget a hundred times.  we can have a modest house and still have a monthly surplus of $1800.  we have a modest savings to cover any large expenses.  we have enough to cover overages, save, and put money towards the house to pay it off a decade early.  having a kid will take some compromising, but another 3 years of my life is just not worth $600/month.

i know am making the wrong decision financially, but i believe i am making the right decision for my sanity.  i don't know if i'm looking for reassurance that i am doing the right thing or need a new perspective, but it feels good to vent.

edit:  i just wanted to say thank you to everyone to responded and offered advice.  i tried to respond to everyone in the beginning, but it was overwhelming in a good way.  thank you again to everyone, and i believe i am making the right decision to move forward with the house plans.

thank you again, it is much appreciated and means a lot.",10

"should i try to pay for a house in cash, or is this a really bad use of money?. my 24m wife 23f and i are just getting started with our careers, and we almost have all of our debt paid off. our credit scores are great, and we could live off of my salary alone fine, but she will probably be making more than me starting in two years once she finishes law school and gets a job. we are both pretty risk averse, and i've always been leery of the way americans buy a $400k house for a 30-year mortgage (pronounced ""debt"") and then end up paying much more for that house over that time period. 

so, we have been talking about staying in our apartment for a couple years longer than originally planned and trying to buy a house... in cash. even if not the whole thing, maybe putting like 60% down or more, and trying to have it paid off within four or five years. to me, it's about cash flow and getting things paid off as quickly as possible so that if something were to happen to one of us (disability or illness, lose our job, etc), we wouldn't be screwed and living in a bigger house than we can afford. i'm big on not having debt - it terrifies me.

i told my friends about it and they thought it was a very dumb idea. they said i should put 20% down or so - however much is needed to get the lowest interest rates possible - and then invest the rest. they said i would get better returns through investing, and it hedges against the risk of your house burns down or property values plummet. i get that, but a) isn't that what insurance is for, and b) the beauty of owning a house outright is that if the property values plummet and the economy tanks... we wouldn't really care because we own that house. to me it still makes sense to try to buy a house in cash even if it isn't the best ""investment"" decision.

"warren buffett just revealed the best investment most people can make. ""buffett's logic is that someone who invests in a s&p 500 index fund, by definition, will match the market's performance.

on the other hand, ""active investors"" as a group will also deliver average investment performance over time -- that is, some managers' investments will do well, and others won't. however, when you add in the cost of actively managed investment options, particularly hedge funds, the result is that the average hedge fund will underperform the market.

from the results of his bet, which competed against five funds-of-funds that represented hundreds of individual hedge funds, it appears his logic was sound. in fact, buffett estimates that 60% of all the fund-of-funds gains went toward management fees.

buffett's main point is that when managers charge high fees, the managers may earn tremendous profits -- but investors won't. therefore, the best investment most people can make, whether they're wealthy or just have a few hundred dollars to invest, is a low-cost index fund such as the one buffett used for his bet.""

"my newborn son passed away after 2 days in hospital. bill is $208,000.. my son was born in indiana but we quickly discovered he was having issues breathing on his own. he was air lifted 2 hours away to indianapolis where he spent 2 nights in nicu connected to ecmo. we discovered he never fully developed blood vessels to carry blood to/from his lungs and heart.

he passed away 3 months ago and we recently received the bills. my gf was on medicaid for pregnant women which covered $5,000 but the remaining balance is $208,000 + $50,000 for helicopter transport. the minimum payments are about $250/mo. we both work full-time but we'd never be able to pay it in our lifetime. 

our situation seems bleak so just asking if we have any other options?

thank you guys. much love to everyone.

"if you drive a used car, put $100-200 in a savings account specifically earmarked for car repairs. i've seen some sound advice about driving used cars in the $2-3k price range. one reason i've heard that people lease or buy new cars under warranty is that they will never have to worry about repairs.

one other way to ""never have to worry about repairs"" is to save $100-200 per month and put it into a savings account earmarked for repairs. a savings account for repairs will take away all of the negative feelings associated with unexpected repairs. your account is also likely to accumulate money over time that can be used for your next car purchase (if your first car was $2000 your second in a few years may be $5000).

you can actually drive a bit nicer cars, too. i had a $7000 honda civic for about 5 years and after depreciation and repairs it cost me on average less than $40/month. it was a car i liked a lot and when something did break, i actually felt good about spending the money to make the repair because that was what the money was for.",10
"should i sell my first home with a $130-150k profit? then rent or buy another home?. i grew up really poor and moved around a lot. my so also moved around a ton growing up. at one point he moved seven times in one year. when we got together and became a little more financially stable, we bought a house four years ago and we both finally felt like we had a home. the market and the area we live in is booming like crazy so we've been considering selling. 3-4 of our friends have already sold and pocked over 100k. one bought a bigger home, and the others are renting, and waiting for the market to go down. it is an option to have this be our forever home, but the prospect of a lump sum of cash is tempting. 

should we sell our home and pay off our debts we've incurred, then rent or buy? so is the only one working right now. i go to school and have about $60k saved up, but have credit card debt and student loans. so has a lot of cc debt. he wants to rent and wait til the market levels off, but i want to pay down half our debt, put some money towards our wedding, then put down for a slightly bigger brand new home, while still saving a small portion to invest in index funds.  we do currently rent out our rooms, and would continue to rent out a room or two in our new home to help pay down principle/create a lovely backyard. we did this with our first home to furnish our entire place within the year. what are your thoughts?

edit: 
just woke up and trying to read through the comments, which i appreciate everyone's input. just for clarification:

i only have $8 grand in cc debt (zero percent interest from a balance transfer). the rest is $27k in student loans i incurred when i lost my fafsa because i started making money. $11k of it was when i was an 18 year old idiot and used the money unwisely, but stopped going to school when i was 20 to work and buy my current home. 15k i would like to pay asap, because it's unsubsidized loans ranging from 3-5%, but i still get a better return in the stock market, but i don't wanna pull out money to pay that down. i own my home with my so so he would get a portion of the profits to pay down his debts as he sees fit. 

the reason i haven't entirely paid down my debt is because i'm currently laid off and i think cash is king. i can pay my mortgage, which is priority number 1 with cash, but everything else can be bought with a credit card. i will be working in a couple months forsure. my job can usually net between $50-80k if i work full time, but i haven't been offered a full time position in two years. all in total, my bills are only $950-1050/month. my car has been paid off for two and a half years and i bought he brand new when i was 18, i'll ride that bitch til it dies. anything i make more than that pays debt. i use my credit card for travel points so there's always a rotating balance, but i do want a significant portion paid down.  

once i start working full time again, i plan on crushing down my credit card debt and student loans within the year, especially if we don't sell the house for a profit. unfortunately my ccs have been carrying me, but i didn't ask to be laid off. and as i've stated, you can delay paying off cc complete, but your mortgage needs to be paid with cash. we pay all our bills on time. 

my so struggled with addiction and racked up ccs without my knowledge. he's been clean for 2 and a half years and i'm trying to help him dig himself out the hole. he makes anywhere from 40-55k. i handle all the money and try to make 2-3k in payments each month depending on how much he makes. 

12k is in 401k
47k is in index funds/roth ira 

i rotate with about $3-5k in cash at all times because i don't want to touch my investments. to clarify, i'm not waiting for the stock market to go down, i'm considering waiting for the housing market to level off. i don't live in california, so it's not entirely unlikely, but like others have stated, it's also all speculation. the other option is to sell my current house and buy 5-7 min away from where i currently live to a ""cheaper"" area but the house is still $350k. and it would be closer to work. we bought our house for $220k brand new from the ground up and still owe $200k. we would net about $130k. our new house would also be a brand new build. 

we have considered refinancing and taking out a heloc, but a lump some of cash is just as enticing. it would prolly shave off $2-300 off of our mortgage which is $1550. 

soooo if we sold i can just pay off the 8k in cc and 15k in student loans, rent in a cheaper area or put down on our forever home. 

long term: 
-finish school. 
-destination wedding (i know people have strong opinions, but as we get older this may be the last time our friends and family can get together before life takes up all the time). plus traveling is very important to us.
-stay in current home or buy our next forever home
-keep funding my index funds

"found out my predecessor earned 37% more than i earn now. how do i approach this for negotiations?. a little over a year ago, both my wife and i were unemployed with our first child on the way. i landed an interview, but thought i bombed it. but two weeks later, i got a phone call from hr double checking my salary requirements. i replied with $60k, which was about 10% more than i made at my previous job. i thought there would be some negotiating, but they sent me an offer letter with the full 60k. i obviously accepted.

fast forward a year. i love my job and the people i work with. everything is great.

i have access to my predecessor's inbox to be able to find pertinent information/conversations regarding old projects. one day while doing exactly that, i saw an electronic copy of her w2. i really shouldn't have clicked it, but my curiosity got the better of me and i saw that she earned over 80k in base salary. obviously i got a bit of sticker shock, then a little jealous.

without addressing salary at all, i asked my manager how my work compares to that of my predecessor. i know she was well liked and good at her job, so i wanted to double check that there were no gaps in job responsibilities or performance that could be used to justify a lower pay grade. my manager assured me that my performance has been equal in most cases and even exceeds in a few areas.

so i guess my question is this. in the next month or so, i have an official performance review with the head of hr, my boss, and the owner of the company (small business, approx $20mil in sales annually.) how can i use this new found knowledge to approach this conversation? obviously i am not going to mention the w2. i have been very happy with this company and have no desire to leave. i don't even truly feel underpaid. but now that i know that i left money on the table, i want to see what we can work out.

"is it normal to ask salaried employees to clock-in?...and then threaten to withhold pay for working less than 40 hours?. i work for a small business that employs around 100 people. i'd guess that maybe 10 of us are salaried and everyone else is hourly. up until last year, i was also hourly until my boss who is also the ceo/owner told me that i would be switching to a salaried position, but to keep clocking in as usual. nothing changed except that my checks were now always the same amount with ""0"" hours worked instead of 40, 41, whatever.   

a couple of weeks ago, i had a small medical emergency that informed them off, and i had to go to the doctor in the afternoon so i left early around 1pm and didn't come back that day. our hr director emailed me today and told me that salaried employees are expected to work 40 hours and told me that i was only at 36 for that pay period. he ended the email with ""what do you want to do about this?""   

so i walked over to him and told him why i was missing hours, and asked him what they end of his message meant. i asked if my boss (the owner) was trying to say that he was going to withhold money for missing those hours. the hr director said ""yes"". i told him that made no sense since i was salaried, and he stuttered and stammered and i told him that i will make sure i'm always hitting my 40 hours (as i have been) but that this seems ridiculous. he said that we were ok and not to worry about it.   

so my questions: is it normal to ask salaried employees to clock in? is it normal to then threaten to withhold pay if they don't hit 40 hours worked per week? is it even legal for them to do that? if not, and they threaten to do it again, what should i do?   

edit: for those who asked, i have zero interactions with outside clients. i do project management and excel work all day every day.  

edit 2: holy crap this thread exploded! a few answers to your guys' main questions:  

1) i was given no contract. i was sent an email telling me i was now salaried and to keep clocking in/out   
2) i get 10 days of pto, but was never instructed that i was required to work 40 hours or that i would still get overtime   
3) i work more than 40 hours plenty of time, including the week prior to this. like i said, it is extremely rare for me to not be at work. i have called in sick three times in the last five years.

"real life example how savings can be good for your mental well-being. hi fellow redditors, just wanted to share this little gem with you real quick.

hey everyone. using my throwaway account because i don't want to be recognised by potential peers. 

i am an 18 year old student from hong kong. because of plagiarism, i will not graduate from high school. my parents, and rightfully so, have decided to kick me out of the house in six month's time. i am at a loss and completely regret my actions, but am ready to do whatever it takes to get myself back on track. i've got a few questions. 

1. how do i find a job? i have no qualifications except for a high school education (of which i did not graduate), so i'm referring to low-pay jobs like janitorial work perhaps.

2. where can i find a place to live? this isn't a plea for someone to take me in. rather, does anyone know of a way to acquire cheap shelter.

3. how am i supposed to set up a bank account, manage money etc. my school never offered a course that gave advice on how to handle money. i know as much about this as a 12 year old would.

i understand that some of the questions i have posted may have answers online. i will be doing my own research whilst waiting for replies on this thread. additionally, the position i am in isn't the most common, so i thought it would be a better idea to post it on a forum like reddit where i could explain my circumstance.

edit : i refrained from stating the type of education i'd received, as i did not want to provide another opportunity to be identified. however, enough kind people have suggested looking for a transfer. i am not in a position to transfer schools because i received a private school education, and thus a transfer would mean having the financial means necessary to pay for the education. on another note, posting this thread has been a great decision. i've just been feeling lost for the whole day, but the advice given has shown that with enough work i can get back on my feet. thank you so much everyone.

"i believe someone has set up a virtual intercept for my phone. i think they can receive and send texts from my number. $8.5k has been stolen from my bank account. help!. first, about 6 months ago, $5.5k was taken out of my checking account via ach. chase refunded it and i closed out the account and spent a month reconnecting all of my finances that used that account. this just happened again with $3k from my new account. the first time it showed up as a paypal payment and this time it showed up as a venmo payment, but neither showed up on my paypal or venmo account. 

i believe someone somehow has access to my phone number? is this possible? they can send and receive texts from my number i believe. there are a few reasons why: there was a few months where i would receive calls from numbers that were very similar to mine (the area code and first 3 digits were the same). i finally answered some of them, and they were usually the same, i would say hello, and the person on the line would be sound confused and say, ""hello who is this?"" i asked 2 of them how they got my number and one of them said they got a text from their son from this number and was calling back. also, i just reset my venmo and paypal password again to be super secure, and when i went to get a verification code, it came from two different numbers, 86753 (which is legit because i've received all my notifications from that number), but another text came from 16466796281 with the verification code. i feel like this one is fake. i'm guessing they are brute forcing my password and using my phone number somehow to 2 step verify? my passwords are way better now than they were before and aren't brute forceable anymore.

has anyone heard of a scam like this? is there a way to see if someone is using my number somehow? is there anything else i can do? thanks!

edit: it sounds like from the comments the phone calls and the bank fraud are separate issues, although i am not fully convinced based on the timing. i believe my chase login was compromised. i have changed passwords for chase, venmo, paypal, google and made them even more secure. i use lastpass for all of my logins. i am also getting a bunch of people saying sms 2 factor authentication is awful. i'm going to use google authenticator where possible. i still have a hard time believing sms is worse than email authentication. any proof on that would be appreciated.

edit 3: some more info, immediately after the money was stolen, i checked chase and venmo and it looked like i had unauthorized logins on both of them. on venmo i was able to remove all of the devices. for chase i had to call support, but they were able to clear all saved devices as well. i never got any validation texts for logins. this keeps pointing me back to someone having access to my phone. i'm going to go into t-mobile today.",10

i'm in a bit of a bind. a complete stranger has zelled me a huge amount of money. seeing this as strange, i called up chase on the phone, to report the transaction. the girl over the phone was fumbling, acting strange, but eventually told me to go to the bank with two forms of id. i went to my local branch, explained the situation, where me, a man working there helping me, and a woman on the phone all conversed. the man was extremely understanding, but while we were speaking, the person sent me another twenty dollars. i immediately showed them. i asked if all of this could be reversed as i don't want to hold a strangers money, but by the time i was able to do anything, they filed a dispute saying the transaction was unauthorized. chase has now frozen or temporarily restricted my account because of this, even though i had no idea what i had done wrong. the woman over the phone was talking over me, as i was trying to dig for an answer as to why this happened. funnily enough the person only reported $500 being unauthorized, but i filed a dispute asking to give the other $520 be returned to the sender. i'm quite young, only 19 years of age, and i do receive financial aid for college, which comes in the form of a check. i feel sick to my stomach, and like i can't explain it to anyone, my parents aren't the most understanding folk, so my questions today are:

is there any way for me to cash my check while my account is frozen pending this investigation?

can i open up a temporary account to use while this investigation goes on with chase?

what would be the best course of action to get my account back to its regular status as fast as possible, so that i may use my debit card again?

thank you so much to anyone and everyone who reads this.

edit: called today and they said they can't do anything until the funds are removed. and that my account is frozen to protect me because the scammers might be going after my account next, (which makes sense.) thank you everyone who's been informing me on the issue, i'll go heading to open up a new bank account soon, but firstly today i'll be speaking to a branch manager about what i can do.",10
"return flight cancelled - airline only offering $200 refund on a $850 ticket. hey everyone, i booked a round trip ticket and used the first half of it to get to my destination. my return flight has been cancelled and the airline said they'd refund me $200. i think this is unfair (i'd expect half, at least) and i'm wondering if i could do a charge-back with my bank. however, i paid with a debit card, and this is my first time doing something like this.

"are there any other ""financial gurus"" (like dave ramsey) that do not intertwine religion with their advice?. i was looking for a good financial podcast to listen to on my way to work but i couldn't seem to find what i was looking for.  i don't dislike dave ramsey (despite thinking he is wrong on a few issues) but i'd rather not listen to someone who intertwines their religious views in their podcast.

update: it's not that i'm ""offended"" or put off by his religious views, but i was just wondering if there are different shows that may cover similar material and not incorporate religion in their show.  

and to those of you who are sending me private messages:  i'm not saying you are ""dumb"" if you listen to dave ramsey nor am i saying he shouldn't mention religion; it is just a preference of mine to not have that in a podcast about finance.

"i'm not being allowed to make payment on a loan i cosigned. in a past life i cosigned a car loan with my now ex-wife.  we got divorced, she was to assume responsibility for the loan.

fast forward a few years and the loan is almost paid off, down to about $300.  i started noticing a few months ago that she was missing the payment deadline, earning some late fees, but ultimately making payments.  i called the bank and verified that they wouldn't report late payments on my credit report unless the late payment was delinquent for 30 days.  so i started watching the loan like a hawk, with the intention of stepping in if a payment ever ran the risk of running over that threshold.

yesterday i saw that it didn't look like my ex was going to make a payment within that 30 day threshold, so i called up the bank to make a payment and was told that due to a situation they were having with my ex--that they could not disclose with me--they would not accept any payments against the loan!

i'm at a loss of how to proceed.  i thought the whole point of cosigning a loan was that i was to be responsible to make payment if the primary loan holder could not, but now they won't let me, and they said they're still going to report the loan to my credit for nonpayment.

i'm kicking myself because maybe i should have made payment as soon as it was late, rather than waiting until it was closer to the 30 days, but i didn't want to do my ex any favors.    i have no contact with her, she has purged all her social media over the last couple years and changed her phone number, i don't even know where she lives, so reaching out to her to figure out what's going on is going to be a problem.

at this point, having made all the mistakes i've made already, how would you proceed in this situation?


edit: i just spoke to someone at the bank and it turns out my ex's checking account and savings accounts are in the red, so they won't let her make payments on her car until she's rectified that situation. so now i'm climbing the supervisor ladder making my case that this shouldn't prevent me from satisfying my obligation to the debt, as that was the whole point of having me cosign on the loan to begin with.

edit2: thank you, everyone.  i finally got someone high enough on the ladder to be authorized to use common sense and they apologized profusely and allowed me to pay off the loan over the phone.  i requested they send me a receipt as i don't trust that this is really done until i have paper saying i'm off the hook, but i feel one step closer.",10
"update: spectrum ""lost"" my returned router. i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8m57d0/spectrum_lost_my_returned_router/) last week about my experience attempting to return a router to spectrum, which was similar to experiences others had detailed in this other post(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8jdimu/always_get_receipts_and_keep_them_stored_properly/) from several months ago.

the tl;dr of the original post is that i returned my router to spectrum in their box with a pre-paid mailing label they sent me, and then they charged me for it anyway and wouldn't cooperate with me with respect to getting it tracked down even though i called multiple times. i eventually paid the charge because i didn't want it sent to collections.

however, on the same day i paid (and posted) i also filed complaints with the fcc and the ftc about their business practices. that seemed to light a fire under their ass, because several days later, i received a phone call from spectrum informing me that my issue had been forwarded to their research dept and that they were working on it. they proceeded to call me every day thereafter to give me updates, and this morning i got a call informing me that they had the tracking number of the label they sent, that their research showed that it had indeed been mailed when i said i had mailed it (shocking!), and that they would be refunding my payment for the router today. 

i just wanted to give an update about this so that others know that if you cannot get satisfaction from the low-level reps at the cable companies, filing a federal-level complaint may get some actual traction going on your problem. 

10/10 would take on big cable again anytime. 

**edited to add:** several people asked how spectrum knew i filed complaints against them. several days after i filed i got an email from the fcc notifying me that they had served the complaint against spectrum, and that the company had 30 days to respond. the next business day (and every day thereafter) i got a very polite call from a spectrum rep informing me that they were working on resolving my issue. the difference in how they treated me before and after filing that complaint was like night and day (they actually seemed to give a damn post-complaint).

also on edit: i received a letter from spectrum (charter) in the mail yesterday about this issue, dated the same day the fcc served the complaint on them. as part of the letter, they referenced the fcc case number, so it was definitely the fcc complaint that prompted them to take some real action on my behalf.

"seriously guys, invest in a dash cam for your vehicle. in my opinion, everyone should have a dash cam. it can potentially save you thousands of dollars if you get into an accident. it doesn't matter if you're a good driver, because guess what? other people aren't. and you're driving within inches and feet of those people every day, especially in the city.

one of my friends just got into an accident when another car ran a stop sign (along with speeding) and t-boned her on a country road. guess what? the guy is pointing the finger at her and there were no other people around so no witness'. i have never been in that situation before so i don't know what's going to happen, i'm assuming she'll be going to court over this. if she had a dash cam, it would be an easy win for her.

you can find a cheap dash cam on amazon for sub $100. the really nice ones are around $300 or so, still pretty cheap for what it does. the one i have is around $150, hd recording, starts automatically when the car turns on. records in a 90 minute loop.

so if you don't have a dash cam in your vehicle, i highly recommend you invest in one asap.

/r/roadcam

/r/dashcam

**edit:** man, this blew up overnight. i'll try and go through my inbox and respond. been getting a lot of questions on how dash cams work and how to ""wire"" them. there is no ""wiring"" needed, you don't need to be a mechanic to do this. i know absolutely nothing about cars. **all you do is take it out of the box, attach the camera to the mount that comes with it. put the mount (suction cup) to your wind shield. plug it into the lighter charger and you're done. it's really that simple. when you turn on the car it will start recording automatically. you don't need to touch it. it records on a 90 minute loop and stores 18 five minute videos on a sd card that comes with it. what if it gets stolen? well, i live in a safe area so i never have to worry about that. if i lived in the city i would definitely take it off and store it in the glove box or out of sight somewhere**

the dash cam that i have is the **kd links x1**. so everything that i said is specific to that camera. i'd post the link here but people would probably get upset and accuse me of trying to make money. so just go to amazon and look it up. it's a great camera and awesome customer service.",10

"recently got my car totaled by a city garbage truck. the amount they are offering is way lower than what i expected. do i have options?. i have a 2010 ford focus with 86k miles. i was actually selling it and had 3 interested buyers for $4,000. the car had a dent already on the opposite side of the garbage truck impact. the city is basically saying without the dent my car would be worth $4,087 however the kbb value of it with the dent and scratch is $4,100 and in good/great condition $4,500-$5,000. so they are already low balling me there. not only that but they said if i wanted a rental (the car was unable to be driven) i would need to go through my insurance and file a claim. my insurance said they should be paying for it. (previous accident the company of the truck that hit me paid for damages and a rental)  
now, to the price they are offering me because of the prior dent damage... $2,854 (tax included). is there anything i can do about this? i really needed at least $4,000.  
this is my first post on any financial/advice sub so please let me know if i'm in the right place or if there is any other information ya'll may need to know.

edit: so i've gotten way more advice than i could have hoped for. a couple of things i have already done since posting.  
i've used both kbb and nada as well as looked at local postings of the same make, model, year of vehicles for sale. they are around and over $5,000 with well over 100k miles. so with the previous damage of a quoted ""$1,400"" i should still be getting close to $4,000 regardless.  
i have spoken to my insurance company and will make a claim with them if i do not get a reasonable offer from the city in response to my documentation and email. only reason i don't want to go initially through insurance is due to the fact that i will have to pay a deductible and risk my premium going up as some people have mentioned. also, i recently reduced coverage on the vehicle.   
.  
edit 2: also, for those stating to claim injury or speak to injury attorneys / lawyers. i was not in the vehicle at the time of the incident. garbage truck hit it, took off, then over an hour later came back down the other side of the street when the cop stopped him. he initially claimed to have not hit my car (grease and yellow paint all over my blue car) then claimed he didn't know he hit it even though the paint on his truck from my car seemed as if he tried scraping it off. usually garbage trucks do not take over 30min to come back down the other side of our street either...

edit 3: my state is texas. i will be looking into filing a loss of use claim for sure. i will also be making some more phone calls to my insurance company and going from there. i have read a lot of your comments with similar stories who have had great outcomes. hopefully i will report back with the same. thank you all again for the good (and bad) advice and the cold hard truths of the possible negative outcomes o_o thanks

edit 4: last update for today until i reach a milestone. for those saying i need to use my insurance company, i was told by my insurance company that they can't do anything since i recently changed my coverage to liability and personal injury. didn't include collision due to me selling the vehicle soon. just my shitty luck. so that's out of the question. on to fighting the city by myself with the help of reddit.",10
"beware other ally bank users. recently my bank card was somehow comprised and charged a penny in oregon. i'm in central california. during the compromise i recieved 1 legitimate phone call from ally asking me to confirm that i didnt make the charge and that my card would be disabled and to call back to get a new card issued. 

i forgot to call back quickly since i was at work when it happened. late that evening maybe 8:30 or 9pm i got a call from ally bank under the caller id i set up. asked me about the compromise and needed to confirm the charges were mine and if they were that they would be charged to my account. the woman on the phone worded it strangely and i had her repeat it to me several times. she also said we are on a secure line and that the call is being recorded about 5 times in the first minute of the phone call which i thought was strange. she then began to throw out numerous large dollar amount charges at major retailers that had been declined. this got my heart beating hard. she continued to say over and over that this is a secured line and is being recorded. after saying none of that was mine asked me to confirm my identity with my online banking username. that's when it clicked for me. never had ally used my online banking id to confirm identity. she insisted it was a new update to their systems. i refused to give it out and said i would call back to ally myself. she told me that's unnecessary and that again this is a secured and recorded line and she already has all my information in front of her. told me to look at the caller id and how it is the official ally number. the way she insisted me not to end the call really made it clear this was a scam call. she kept trying to call me maybe 5+ times while i was waiting to get someone at ally on the phone.

"update to negotiating a raise based on headhunter's invitation to apply. hi guys, i posted(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/disof5/negotiating_a_raise_based_on_a_headhunters/) a few weeks back about how a headhunter contacted me for a position offering a significant pay increase and whether i could use that to ask for a raise at my current job. it didn't get a ton of attention but i figured an update might help some people out so i'm posting one anyways.

the consensus in the last post was that no, i could not get a raise based solely on this invitation and i should either ignore it or get an offer before asking for a raise. i didn't want to ignore it, but getting an offer i had no interest in felt disingenuous. i decided to bring it up anyways, but didn't want to push it as a demand for a raise because of the responses i received. instead, i brought it up to my boss as more of a discussion about the company and why other companies are offering more. essentially the conversation went ""hey boss, a headhunter contacted me for a position and while i'm not at all looking to change jobs, they are quoting a salary more than 20k above what i make now. i feel like i'd be an idiot to not at least look into it. why are other companies offering so much more?"" 


apparently, there is a wage compression happening across my industry as a whole within the past year, and companies are having to offer more money to new hires to get them to accept. he also spoke more specifically about the company that sought me out. i have a very niche skill that is relatively expensive to invest in (scuba diving for underwater inspections). both of the employees who used to work for my company that now work for the prospective company were involved in this field. i do not do this with my current company and have little interest in pursuing it, but theoretically i could earn more money if i decided to pursue it with another company. finally, he ended with the fact that i am highly valued within the company, and he would talk to finance and see what he could do for me.


a week and a half after the discussion, we had a follow-up meeting in which he gave me a $4k raise, so ~7%. this is immediate, and i will still receive a raise in the spring for annual raises. not enormous, but enough to be worth the effort. he also said he is giving my coworkers small raises (although not as much as mine).


could i have gotten a bigger raise if i had followed up with the headhunter and secured an offer before bringing it up? probably. however, i didn't want to rock the boat, and it felt immoral to waste the other company's time interviewing for an offer i had no desire to accept. also, i'm lazy by nature.


tl;dr brought it up despite not having an offer in hand, got a 4k raise for myself and small raises for my coworkers. probably could have gotten more if i had an offer, but a small raise is better than the nothing i would have received had i just ignored the other company.",10
"my parent/sibling/significant other/friend wants me to cosign on a auto loan/mortgage/student loan with them. should i do it?. one of the most common recurring questions on /r/personalfinance these days seems to involve a scenario where a close friend or family member, often a parent or sibling, wants the poster to cosign on some sort of financial commitment for which the acquaintance would not otherwise qualify, due to problems such as poor credit, insufficient/inconsistent income, or other unspecified issues. 

in many cases, the person pressuring the poster to cosign will offer an emotional argument which resonates with the poster, such as pointing out times in the past where they've helped the poster in one way or another. 

this post is an attempt to canonically summarize the community wisdom around this recurring topic.

**here goes:**

if you cosign on any sort of financial obligation with another person, you're equal partners in that obligation. this means that you're on the hook for payment just as much as the person asking for your cosignature. there are (at least) two major implications of this fact:

- if the person for whom you are cosigning finds themselves unable or unwilling to continue making timely payments, **you** will be pursued for the debt and held accountable as much as they will be. this means that unless you step up and take over making payments, debt collectors may be sent after you, the delinquency will likely be reported to your credit score, and you will, broadly, suffer the exact same consequences as if *you'd* defaulted on a loan that was solely in your own name.

- additionally, and *just as importantly*, even if all is well and timely payments are being made, the loan will show on your credit report as though it is yours (since it effectively *is*). this means that in the case of a major loan such as a mortgage, or even an auto loan, your ability to get a loan of your own in the future may be negatively impacted. if you cosign on a mortgage to, say, help a parent out of a bind, you may find yourself unable to secure your own financing when you're ready to buy a home of your own, as until the cosigned loan is paid off, you already have a mortgage.

for these reasons and more, the community consensus is almost always that cosigning a loan is inadvisable and should be avoided. do not cosign on any obligation that you aren't prepared to take full responsibility for if things go awry. if you're absolutely sure you could and would take on that responsibility without derailing your other financial goals, it **might** be okay to *consider* cosigning on, say, an auto or student loan -- but if you aren't ready for that responsibility, then run, don't walk, away. as for a mortgage, it is advised that you should never cosign on a mortgage with someone you are not married to, full stop. this means you are advised not to cosign on a mortgage for a sibling, parent, or friend -- ever. marriage (in the united states and countries with similar legal systems around marriage) comes with legal parameters to help determine what happens in case two people separate while sharing a debt. if you aren't married, there's no protections, and any sort of falling out or separation is dramatically likely to result in a major, regrettable headache. 


furthermore, even if you feel that you are fully prepared for the possibility of being held responsible for payments, take time to deeply consider all other potential financial implications of the decision before taking on this commitment. when a bank refuses to provide specific financing to a person, that means that they've made a determination that it's a bad idea. if they've made determined that it's too risky for them to facilitate the financing, it's almost always safe to say that it's too risky for you to consider as well.

no matter how hard someone works to convince you that you're in a position where you can do them a major favor, it's important to recognize that by cosigning on a debt that they are potentially not going to be able to repay, you would be setting them up for even more significant hardship down the road. even if it seems difficult to refuse, in the vast majority of cases, choosing not to cosign is ultimately the better choice for *all* parties involved.

"my family is forcing me to co-sign a mortgage loan. the thing is i'm the only person in the house that doesn't have debt and have good credit (~700). my mom is forcing me to co-sign a 250k mortgage loan on the house with 5.2% interest. obviously, i'm not comfortable with this. i'm a full-time college student who work two part time jobs. she and my aunt are the ones who's going to pay and they promised me that it won't be an issue where this comes up but nothing is ever guaranteed in life. i need help i don't know much and my family shunned me when i said i don't want to sign it.

my question is what is the pros and cons of this? i'm so lost and i need help. they said worst case scenario if we can't make more payments then they will find someone to buy it off of us and it won't be an issue but what happens to me if we got foreclosed on?

"please take some time to understand your benefits at work. i'm a federal employee and you wouldn't believe how often i encounter people who have no idea how any of our benefits work. the most common i see are:

* people find out they (or their federal employee spouse) are pregnant and want to know how much maternity leave we get (answer: none)
* they think fmla is 12 weeks of paid leave - this is disturbingly common
* then they want to know how they can get short-term disability after the baby is born (answer: that's not a benefit the government gives you - you would have had to enroll before now)
* they want to know how the leave bank works (many agencies have this) and are shocked when they find out they would have had to already be contributing to it in order to draw from it
* they have no idea how our retirement savings (tsp) work - have either not been contributing since they started employment, or are contributing a little but have never adjusted the allocation beyond the government bond fund that all new enrollees are in

august 2013 - i get married and my wife and i find an apartment to move into the week before our wedding.  we looked at some really dumpy places for $600 a month, but i didn't feel safe in those neighborhoods at pretty much any time of day. so we settled on a apartment in a somewhat nicer part of town, closer to my work, that was $800 a month. that was as low as i could go and be comfortable living in my own apartment.


this is when things really start to take off.  my wife is a very frugal person (she lived in africa for a few years with nothing), and we help each other when we wanted to give in. we took most of the money we received from our wedding and put it towards the debt, starting of course with the highest interest cc. mine weren't too bad honestly since i've always had good credit even with the really high utilization.  the most i was paying was about 13% (it's crazy to me now that i ever paid that much)

we saved everywhere we could. for the first months she stayed home and found every way to save money to put towards debt. she cooked every meal, and we didn't do anything but spend time with each other(worked out for the newlyweds).  we had a strict budget and spent that to the dollar. she would go through the grocery ads and find things on sale and that's what we ate that week.  we only had 1 car (my old one being broken), and so i drove to work and back and that was it. no where else unless we had to go.   i made my own lunch every day (while all my co-workers went out) and we didn't go out drinking or really anywhere. we might go see our family and friends but we never ate out. we did have a tv i owned, but we just used an ota antenna i had and watched our movies we already had on dvd. 

pretty much the only items in our budget were rent, water/sewer, electricity, internet service (lowest i could get), groceries, gas , car insurance, and then debt. my work paid for my cell phone and i got my wife a republic wireless phone that cost $12 a month using our internet. 



nov 2013 - i get my wife a part time job at my work, making $10 an hour.  she has a degree in nursing but we wanted to have kids so we always planned for her to stay home.  since she works at my workplace, we keep the 1 car and ride together.  now she brings home around $800 a month which all goes to paying the debt. i also start getting some overtime at my job and that helps a little as well.  we are literally paying maybe close to 2k or more a month now to the debt.


oct 2014 - a year has gone by and all the credit card debt is all paid off, and we are just working on my much lower interest student loan debt. but now we find out my wife is pregnant!  we are so happy but we really don't want to raise a child in our apartment in a sketchy part of town.  in the year or so we've been there, we'd seen some bad things that would make you shudder. so we consider how we could buy a house in a better neighborhood. we decided that a home right now was more important than the debt temporarily, especially since all the loans were under 6% interest (majority of it was at 3%). also they kept raising the rent on us and it had gotten to over $900 a month. 

i also was getting some overtime at my job, but i was moving up quickly.  i was able to negotiate a 9% in place raise when i set up a meeting to review my hourly rate. this put me up around 47k and maybe a little more with overtime.  so instead of saving now for the debt, we stopped and started saving for the house. just put the minimal in all the student loans.  also i did fix up myself my old 86 nissan, and so we had 2 cars now.  this was good so that my wife could stay home more days and rest and go out if needed.


jan 2015 - so we start looking for a home with a realtor, though i'm not sure why.  we did all the work looking through homes and all he did was just set up the times to go look at them. we went out about 5 saturdays and looked at about 6 homes each time.  we would find one we really liked in our price range but then someone else would get it. or there were ones we liked and weren't under contract, but they weren't willing to negotiate down in price.  then one day i found this perfect house randomly on a website, for sale by owner.  i drive by and there's not even a for sale sign on it so i have my realtor talk to him and we negotiated an offer for 219k.  it was a high amount for what is usually considered reasonable by this sub, but i knew i was going to be making more money soon and with our current budget, paying that mortgage wasn't that much more than our rent. 


april 2015- we closed on the house, the seller to pay all the closing costs, we even got a home warranty in there for free. we had only enough cash for 10% down, and i accepted that since the pmi wasn't much with my credit score.  and i was able to get 3.75%  interest on the house with no points, which was great. i spent $80 on a moving truck and did it all ourselves.  


may 2015 - we started putting that extra money back towards the debt again, though obviously less than before. and my wife had stopped working around here, so we lost that extra $800 a month. 

july 2015 - baby born!  this threw a big cost at us, since my work's health insurance deductible was at $5000.  i had some of that in my hsa, but 4k or more came out of my pocket. plus all the other expenses that come with a baby,it was a stretch but not too bad. our good budgeting helped immensely.


august 2015 -  the guy above my position was fired because he was horrible at his job and i was doing all the work for him.  they then promoted me to his position and pushed me up to 55k a year salary.  no more overtime, which sucked because it had really been helping us out. but i did get a bonus if the year was good. 


jan 2016 -  i made the last payment to the student loans. i got paid an extra paycheck and i got a bonus and that was enough to finish it off for good.  it was the greatest feeling, like i'm free!  and i found out we are having another baby! another $5k to pay, hah. 


so moral of the long story, you can do it on a reasonable salary. you find the cheapest place to live that you can, and you put everything to your debt. sell things, work extra hours, do whatever you can to get it gone asap. live as cheaply as possible, and it's a minute by minute decision. you don't need to spend $2 on a soda when water is free. you don't need to buy a new car when it won't cost that much to fix your old one. be determined and it can work. 

i left alot out because this is already too long, especially some specifics, feel free to ask and i'll try to reply. 


edit:  yes i agree title is misleading on having no debt, i owe $190k on my house still which is debt. 

edit 2 :  you can believe what you like,  but our wedding money was around 2k.  so we are talking about 30 months,  which is $60k of money at the average rate of 2k a month. sometimes more and sometimes less. and anything else i could get my hands on went to the debt. so this is definitely possible to do saying i paid off the 43k and put down 21k on the house in the 30 months time frame. i don't print money in my office,  obviously there are other things that help like tax returns,  bonuses,  christmas gifts,  some odd jobs, and sold some car parts. all things that are fortunate to have,  but something most people use for things other than debt. i know not everyone is as well off as even i was,  but i want people to know it's possible to get out of the hole if you work at it. every situation is different. the whole point is get out of debt by any means necessary as soon as possible.

tldr: sprint refused to recognize that i had returned my phone after cancelling my policy and was sending me to collections despite the fact that i had receipts proving i returned the phone.

resolution: i contacted the sprint ceo on linkedin and he had someone call me first thing in the morning, they fixed my issue within 5 minutes. nothing aside from contacting the ceo directly did anything. i posted on their fb, chatted with them on fb, called in many times and went to my local store. if you need anything done seems you have to skip to the top. i'm very impressed that the ceo replied personally and fixed the issue though, kudos to him, shame the customer service reps don't share his sense of ownership.",10

if anyone here remembers that post, thanks for the advice. they didn't even try to stop me from cancelling the order

"nip lifestyle creep in the bud - before it's too late. i turned 40 just over a month ago and for a number of reasons it's a pretty glaring milestone in the history of one's life.

on average you're half way to climbing into a coffin for a long well-deserved dirt nap and so naturally it makes sense to ponder your midterm report card.

whether you want to or not, it's kind of human nature to look around to your peers...to see how you are matching up to your buddies - not so much as a dick measuring contest but more so simply as part of the global analysis.

and 40 is a time in your life where some of your friends start to get those ""real"" promotions...the kind where they make partner or earn a seat in the board room or their business really takes off...the kind of step-up that makes it possible to never have to worry about money ever again (if you play your cards right).

but one thing i noticed is that so many people i know who are now pulling in this kind of dough are far from financial independence.

i know a lot of couples earning well over $200k as a household and they still worry about money and not having enough.

and the reason is lifestyle creep.

**they call it ""creep"" because it's sneaky**

it happens to pretty much everybody who's ever earned more money than they used to.

take a look at your clothes. your food. your furniture. your home. your car. your entertainment...and on and on and on.

you upgrade almost all of this stuff - when you were perfectly happy ten years ago with a similar version that cost half as much.

instead of your favorite candy - you've now moved up to your favorite wine.

items that used to be luxury are now the norm and your new wants are things that never before entered your mind's eye.

you're spending more because you have it - not because it's truly necessary.

you've slowly but surely made a complete shift with regards to what's ""normal"" and over time far too many wants make their way over to the needs category.

and all the while it never crosses your mind because it's happening slowly, like the tortoise catching up with the hare.

**the time to catch it**

and the time to nip this phenomenon in the bud is now. 

because once you creep forward it's pretty tough to creep back.

once you're used to wine and brie, it's hard to enjoy kool-aid and velveeta.

it's hard to move back into a smaller house. it's hard to sell your flash new audi to drive a used toyota. it's hard to head back to the nosebleeds once you're used to box seats! it's hard to pack your lunch every day when you absolutely can afford to eat out every single day.

it's much easier to beat lifestyle creep in advance - long before you're used to all these unnecessary upgrades.

**why don't you fuck off back to /r/frugal :)**

before the ""why work hard to get ahead if you're not going to enjoy your money?"" retorts start rolling in...i'm not saying that we shouldn't upgrade our lifestyles as we start to earn more money.

of course we should. of course we should reward ourselves with nice things and vacations and new cars and bigger homes when appropriate. 

what i am saying is that we should do it consciously, in a deliberate manner - to make sure that our upgrades are measured and to ensure that our choices fit our personal tastes and that we're not ""moving on up"" just because.

we should upgrade our lives in such a way that we don't wind up earning twice as much money only to find that finances are just as tight as ever.

**the simplest stop gap**

the easiest way to stop yourself from increasing expenditures in proportion to increased earnings is to set an actual number with regards to how greatly you'll allow your lifestyle to creep.

some people like 50/50.

if you get a $10,000/year raise - half is for improving quality of life and half goes straight into savings.

maybe a different ratio works better for you...just be sure you don't spend it all.

**discover what's important to you**

for me i've found that one of the best ways i have been able to control lifestyle creep is in being truly honest with myself about which aspects of my lifestyle are actually important to me. when we were living off an insanely tight budget to save up the money to build gecko rock we were able to truly see which luxuries we missed and which ones we didn't.

we now spend money where it matters (to us) and get by with ""inferior"" goods where it doesn't really matter (to us).

my wife and i spend on travel but never pay full price for an item of clothing. we enjoy good food but would never dream of spending hundreds of dollars on a watch or jewelry.

find out what's important to you and spend your upgrade funds there...don't spend money to buy goods that are really only a luxury to someone else.",10
"for those of you struggling financially.... just remember that everyone's personal financial situation is unique. something that works for someone else may not work for you.

find what works for you and keep on working towards your goals!",10

"reminder that you can negotiate your medical bills even with insurance!. i got a $756 medical bill in the mail for a ct scan and an er overnight stay. i already have insurance and they covered around $1200 of it.

i am in ~$3000 worth of credit card debt and the minimum monthly payment that the hospital was asking for was ~$250. this is about the amount i put down on this credit card debt each month. because of this, it was seriously going to hurt me in how fast i could pay off this debt.

i had read about calling up the hospital's billing department and negotiating the debt, so i went ahead and gave it a try. the conversation went as such (h = hospital, m = me):

> m: ""hi, i received a bill for $756 in the mail and that seems outrageously high for the services i was provided. the state average for a ct scan is roughly ~$108 versus your charge of $966...""

>h: ""we have never charged $108 for a ct scan. your bill is itemized for those services correctly. will you be able to make your payment?""

>m: ""well, i'm not going to pay this. this is absolutely too high.""

>h: ""well, what can you afford to pay?""

>m: ""listen, i'll pay 20% of this bill *right now*, if you write off the remaining 80%.

>h: ""alright, please hold for a moment so i can run this by a few people.""

i waited on hold for about five minutes before they came back on the phone.

>h: ""hi, so that's acceptable for us. if you agree to pay $151, we will waive the remaining $605. does that sound good?""

>m: ""that's perfect, thanks!""

i went ahead and paid over the phone, and checked my online account and the remainder was indeed waived as a ""charity adjustment""!

"i just got a 25% raise (58k to 72k)! thanks to this sub for the great advice, details inside!. hi r/personalfinance. i'd like to share my success story about recently asking for and receiving a raise.

i currently work in an account executive/outside sales position in a medium size, international company (1,500+ people). i was hired and trained straight out of college, which is extremely out of the ordinary for my type of position (most similar outside sales entry level positions are 5+ years experience). during my final interview, i was asked to name my salary expectations. i asked for 50k (which to 22 year old kid, sounded like a lot at the time) and they happily obliged. i received a 3k increase after successfully completing training and another 5k of the course of the next 3.5 years or so. i should also note that i get reimbursed fully on all gas receipts, cell phone, and a 6k per year taxable auto allowance. i also receive a yearly bonus that has usually been about 1 month of salary. my w2 showed 72k in taxable income last year.

i have been extremely successful and have worked very hard to build my own account base in my job the past 4 years. my company and direct managers are very pleased with my progress, they think i'm a hard worker, and i always get great reviews. the real problem is my salary or bonus is not based on commission. i'm salaried with a profit sharing bonus that is based on how well the company (not the individual salesperson) does. 

this past year i did very well based on all measurable metrics. i knew that if i really wanted a raise, the time to strike was now. the past 1 or 2 years, i had been approach by several headhunters. i'm not really looking for a change of scenery as my current industry is consolidating, there are financial woes, and i'm well liked and really like my current work/life balance. however, i couldn't ignore the numbers they were throwing out. the last recruiter to contact me told me the salary was up to 90k + benefits depending on experience (with a min of 3-5 years experience in my current role). 58k vs 90k is quite the discrepancy.

during my last review i mentioned to my direct manager that i was unhappy that our bonuses/salary is not based on how we do as individual sales people. i also mentioned the fact that i had been approached several times by headhunters. i reiterated that i really enjoy my job and want to stay but asked if there any way to have a review. he said that he would get the message over to hr but wouldn't promise anything. all salary decision must be reported to hq in asia for their decision. 
	
less than a week later i was told that the president of the us would be in town for unrelated business and he would like to talk to me. we met and had an hour long discussion. i was able to really get him to relate to me, i shared with him the cost of living in los angeles, how i really enjoyed working with the company and would like to continue to grow there, and how i felt my number were incredible good. he just was put into his position about a year ago, so he had no idea how much we all made.

he told me that there should be no problem getting an increase for me. all my managers think i'm very hard working, i get very good result, and i always get very high marks on my appraisals. he asked me to name a range and i asked for a bump to the 70-75k range (12-17k) increase. he told me he would send a request asap to the global vp who could decide on these matters.

less than a week later (!!) hr called and informed me that they had agreed to a 14k increase to 72k per year (25% of base!). in return, i gave them a commitment to stay for 3 years. as i mentioned before, there's a lot of turmoil and consolidation in the industry, so it's a good time to stay put and ride this out. i felt great that my managers went up to bat so fast for me and my company likes me so much they gave me a huge increase and wants to tie me up for 3 years. i'm also eligible for all future scheduled raises and i'm in a higher bracket for the year profit sharing bonus.

all in all i went from 58k salary to 72k salary effective this month! on top of the other benefits and bonus, i'll be making at least 90k per year which i'm so excited about! i was very hesitant and nervous to ask but i thought that i deserved it. i lurked this sub for good advice constantly so i wanted to share my story of good fortune! thanks to everyone for reading, let me know if you have any questions!

"paying parents' bills is crushing me. i'm 23 and my parents had me later in life. both  receive social security (totaling $3,000). since i graduated i've been paying whatever  their ss doesn't cover. i'm losing money paying their bills -i've given them over 10 grand already. i  dont know what  steps they should be taking now and they dont either.
they have about $30,000 in credit card debt and the payments are about $550 a month. at first they thought about moving but i doubt they'll find anywhere cheaper (mortgage is $685 a month plus $210 hoa) . i was dropped from the family health insurance once i graduated but the insurance said they would not lower the per month cost since my brother is still on the plan. this bill is the biggest $921,  but theres car insurance, home insurance, cable (they refuse to drop this and honestly they dont do much but eat and watch tv). 
i have heard people suggest filing for bankruptcy, reverse mortage, my parents  want to do a home equity loan  but at this point that will just go to the credit card bill  and i dont think it will improve anything. we're  in florida if that changes anything. i just feel so out of my depth and i dont know what direction to go in. is there any advice for this situation?  


okay edit: holy shit thank you all for responding. i'm slowly reading through comments, i guess i'll try to answer  some common  stuff up here 
1. i do plan to stop paying, i  set up a budget for them months ago and they didn't cut back or change their lifestyle. this is just so i can offer them with advice. 
2. the scary thing is my  parents do have small part time jobs. mom hasn't worked since i was born, but right now she  pet sits for friends thought that amounts to maybe $50 a month. dad works  at the grocery store and they cut his hours recently so he gets maybe $200 a month.
3. the health insurance said because i was no longer a student i wouldn't be covered so i was sort of forcefully removed from the plan.
4. before i started voluntarily giving them money, my parents were taking money from my brother's account since they had access. they took almost $7000 from him. i dont want him to have to think about any of this, he's 21 and he worked hard to get scholarships and is paying his way through college like i did. so i wont involve him any more. 
4. my dad is 76, mom is 62. he is on medicare but i have no idea how any of that stuff works so when he told me what the bills were at first i just assumed that was already the only option they had. 

when i'm home tonight i'll post concrete numbers of the bills i consistently pay. i have access to their bank account and i send out all the payments after i transfer my money to their account.  
thanks again for all the advice, i feel like an idiot for not  figuring this out sooner but i was just nervous to look into this at all for a while

update:  i am not feeling like a good son (not that i could, its 2018 and y'all assumed my gender). i have an older half sister that i confided in as a result of all this, she lives nearby and wanted to meet with my parents and i to help us plan finances. i told my parents and asked them to come with me. this was a very bad move. lots of drama ensued but this is personal finance not personal drama. parents said bankruptcy is ""morally wrong""  and they will never  use that option. they are going to sign the home equity loan. i told them if that's their choice i can't offer them any more money once i disentangle myself from their bills.  all i can do to help them now is remove myself from their bills. i'm very disappointed in all 3 of us for not being able to work together cooperatively. thank you all for your advice, i just have to worry about my own budget now.",10

"equifax is refusing to remove my father's bankruptcy from my credit report. any advice?. i will try to make this quick. my father and i both have the same name, except my parents added the jr. suffix to my official title. my father does not use a suffix. neither of us have middle names. my father filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2016 after he became permanently disabled. in may 2018, equifax reports to have received notification of a bankruptcy and has mistakenly applied the public record to my credit report as well.

now is where the fun begins.

i file a dispute with equifax in 2018 after the bankruptcy appears on my credit report. they close the dispute and have determined that the bankruptcy has been correctly assigned to my report. oh jesus, here we go.

i call equifax again and i'm told that the jr. suffix does not exist in their records and i will need to send correspondence with an official cover letter and pertinent official documents (birth cert, ss card, license, utility bill, etc.) asking them to add the official jr. suffix that is on all of my documents since birth.

after a week, i call equifax again. they claim that my address on the fax that i sent them was illegible and they cannot complete the request. great, now i need to re-do all of this because their printer is out of toner.

equifax also tells me on this phonecall that they can see the bankruptcy is filed under my father and has also been applied to my credit report. but the woman i spoke with cannot do anything about it other than file another dispute, which she doesn't review, and will not disclose to me who reviews it. she advised me to contact the united states bankruptcy court to obtain a letter stating that the bankruptcy is my father's and not mine.

so i call. they don't provide, and have never provided, such a letter to anyone. i am then advised to enter the court records and purchase copies of anything that could maybe help me.

i am currently writing 2 cover letters. one for the jr. suffix addition, and one for the incorrectly assigned bankruptcy. i have printed out anything from the court records that shows my fathers ssn and his name on the same page because i cannot trust equifax to do any investigation of their own. i will be sending these packages by certified mail this time, and not fax.

&#x200b;

if anyone has any advice or guidance, please let me know. i'm 25 years old with a great job and i cannot buy a car, i cannot buy a house, i cannot buy a ring, i don't qualify for any credit cards or loans. my entire future is on hold because equifax refuses to fix their mistake. here's the kicker, experian and transunion both have all of my information recorded correctly! its just equifax, the turds that exposed almost every american's identity in 2017.

edit: update#2\*\*  hey everyone! so i have sent the two correspondences i was writing yesterday via certified mail & return receipt. i have also filed a complaint with the cfpb. the ftc website seems to just redirect you to the cfpb when filing a credit complaint on their website. maybe i will file one under the ""other"" tab for the ftc's complaint system to receive a separate ding.

i have not spoken to an attorney quite yet, but if this is not resolved once i receive my return receipts (hopefully next week) i will most definitely be speaking with / hiring one immediately. a very kind redditor has also provided me with some executive emails to escalate this further once they've received my correspondence.

i was at my wits end with this whole ordeal, and all of your support and advice has really softened the blow. thanks again! i promise to keep updating all of you! stay kind!

"college student without a credit card, just found out that i have a credit score.. i'm 19 years old and currently attending a cc and was looking for starter credit cards to start building my credit score. i read that i should first make a credit karma account just to make sure if i do or don't have a credit score. 

well i made the account and found out that i have a i have 772 credit score. basically my parents made me an authorized user on their credit card about about 1.5 year ago and have been building my credit for me. i use the credit card all the time but i never thought that it was my own credit card. i'm really grateful to them for it because they know how important credit score is in the adult world. 

my question is: should i still look for a new credit card under my own name or should i continue being an authorized user under my parents? 

edit: thank you guys for all your advice! i'm going to remain an authorized user under my parents credit card. i'll also be getting my own credit card as well. i read every single comment and appreciate all the advice! ",10
"does anyone here believe 401k's have created a bubble in the stock market that will pop once the boomers start to withdraw?. i invested heavily in my 401k, probably like most of you. has there been much talk about what will happen when more people are withdrawing from their 401k than putting in?

"beware ""new"" debt consolidation companies. i just received ""debt consolidation"" offers from crisp funds and whistler funding. i found it odd they were essentially identical, seemed to offer too good to be true rates and had no reg z disclosures.

in the little bit of research i've done i've found that the same ""company"" is doing business under numerous names all run by the semi-infamous mec distribution...

their previous ""businesses"" include:

guardian angel funding

graphite funding

salvation funding

doublestar financial

broadstar financial

bridgeline funding

pebblestone financial

lafayette funding

crestmont funding

guardian angel funding

sovereign funding

it appears that since they caught so much heat under these names they have recently opened new ""businesses""...i have found at least 3 new ones:

crisp funds
whistler funding
stonedale partners

identical mailers, nearly identical websites, all 3 sites anonymously registered on 10/25/18. god knows how many other names they're functioning under. they're also using virtual addresses for all of their ""businesses""...

their disclosures state they are a marketing firm that simply tries to connect you to an outside lender and make a referral bonus but people who have spoken to them are told ""they couldn't find a match for you"" and they recommend their scammy debt settlement program. 

perhaps worst of all, they're run under a rent-a-tribe scam so that they are protected against lawsuits by sovereign immunity afforded to native american tribes by operating as a ""tribal-run"" business. so you wouldn't have any recourse for when they inevitably scam you. (this is also how they get away with not having the legally required reg z disclosures on their offers)

beware!!!

edited to update mec funding to the name found on bbb, etc. (mec distribution) so folks can see some of the prior issues

"warning regarding capital one 360. i'm writing to warn you about capital one 360. i also posted this warning in /r/mortgages. 

the short of it is that they lost our ""cash to close"" by wiring our money to the wrong bank.

my husband and i had the money that we'd saved for a down payment in a capital one 360 account. as our closing date approached, we were sure to do everything correctly. i even called capital one well in advance (over 10 days) to tell them that we would be transferring cash to close.

the day of the closing, **capital one wired our down payment of almost $20,000 to the entirely wrong bank** –and they didn't even figure out what they had done incorrectly until i pieced it together.

even though they admitted liability (in writing!) they refused to cover the cash to close. if i hadn't been able to take an emergency loan from my parents, we would have lost the house.

capitalone didn't even return the funds to us until i sent them a demand letter (after i'd spent several hours researching the relevant laws).

to ""make up"" for what they did, they offered to send a ""housewarming gift."" i still get sick to my stomach when i think about capital one.

stay far, far away. they acted with gross negligence and treated me and my husband like garbage.

***edit: just to clarify: 

(1) they didn't just key a digit or two incorrectly. they switched our wire transfer instructions with those of another customer. our money was sent to a valid (but incorrect) account.

(2) there was never an option within our account for us to key in the information. i called to give instructions, and then they insisted on written instructions on our attorney's letterhead (which he sent).

(3) they said that they destroyed the source documents shortly after they received them. this only compounded the problem.

(4) i understand that mistakes happen, but **the way that capital one chose to treat us following their mistake is worth a warning.**",10
"student loan debt cancel maybe available to you if you believe your school was shady. itt tech and corinthia college students will get money back if they paid student loans.. as part of the obama-era crackdown on for-profit colleges like itt tech and corinthian colleges, the education department wrote something called the ""borrower defense rule."" it specified how students could get their loan money repaid if their schools were found to be shady. borrowers had to submit an application and show how they were being defrauded. but if the school was shut down altogether, the loan discharge was supposed to be automatic.

"helluva way to start off a new year: i paid off all of my credit card debt from my stupider years.. i finally paid off the last maxed out card debt i had been carrying from my dumber, less financially responsible years yesterday. the only card we have now is a sapphire reserve we pay in full every month.

it ain't fi/re, but it's a helluva lot closer to financial independence than i used to be. this is a milestone i didn't think i'd reach for years. thanks for the support and guidance, y'all.

edit: this blew up quite a bit. thanks for all the kind words and encouragement, everyone! to those asking how, it's really as simple as the sidebar makes it. i set a **realistic** budget (in that i didn't plan to be 100% perfect all the time, i worked in various ""release valves"" that allowed me to fail occasionally without falling off the horse) and i really, no kidding kept to it. it also should be said that a much better paying job went a looooong way, too.

i only say that to take the guilt off some folks. sometimes, it really is just because you don't have enough money. you can cut out everything until there's nothing left to cut out, and you can still not be making enough money. so don't beat yourselves up as much as i have in the past.

then after that — sticking to a budget, decreasing your spending floor, and increasing your income ceiling — it's just a matter of time. that's the hardest part, sticking to the plan. but if you do, it works.",10
"i cosigned for my brother's car. he stopped making payments on it.. long story short, i helped him buy a used car 4 years ago on a 56m loan for $7700 @ $163/m payments. he made the payments on time religiously for ~~4 years and 4 months~~ 47 months (+2 i just paid), i went and counted the payments via credit karma(https://i.imgur.com/98eivrn.png) and it came out to 47 months not 4 years and 4 months.

then we had a falling out 2 months ago over nothing, but he refuses to talk to me and decided to say fuck it and stopped making the payments on the loan. he doesn't answer his phone when i call or text and after he moved out of my house he never gave me his updated address so i have no idea where he lives. 

so naturally the bank calls me letting me know it's 2 months over due. i paid it up to date on the spot. there is $1600 left on the loan which i'm going to pay off fairly quickly should he still continue to not answer my communication attempts to reach him over this. 

he was 2 months behind on the loan and i asked if this would be reported as 2 months late on my credit report and they said yes it would have one hit of 30-60 days late. 

is there anyway i can get that reduced or am i screwed on that? i would've paid the damn loan payments on time had i known he would just stop paying on it. 

kind of feel likes it's a bit unfair that i'm getting hit with a late payment alert on my credit report when they didn't even try and contact me until yesterday about it. 

any advice? 


edit: people seem to think i'm trying to get out of paying the loan. that's not the case, i understand the responsibility that i'm required to pay for it if my brother doesn't make the payments. i was asking if there was anyway to avoid this negatively affecting my credit history. 


big update: the loan officer called me back and said he talked to his bosses and they decided not to push out a late payment alert on my credit since i paid it up to date the moment i was notified that it was behind on the payments. so that's is a huge relief! still have to figure out if my brother will make payments on it going forward, but at least my credit won't be negatively affected.

"what, specifically, are the ""important papers"" you should take with you when evacuating your home because of a disaster?. here in the u.s., hundreds of thousands of people are currently being told to evacuate their homes.  millions more are being advised to prepare ""go kits"" so they are ready to evacuate if necessary.  most of the time, these advisories suggest that you have copies of your ""important papers"" to bring with you.   but it's a little hard to imagine what these would be.  the courthouse already has a copy of my deed.  the insurance company has an online version of my policy.  what are the ""important papers"" i should have in my car when i'm driving away from the disaster?

"im utterly sh*t at saving, so i forced myself to open an account i cant touch and i am forcing myself to save. (nz). i find myself flush with cash, all the time. however i usually just end up pissing it away on useless things- like bacon, for example. the really expensive bacon. then cars, i went and bought a $65,000 car last year, then it ended up being written off due to mechanical issues (no fault of my own, the ""warranty"" at the dealership was a fat waste of money and they found a way to slime their way out of paying out for the work). 

so, high time i put cash aside as last year my s.o got cancer and it was a wake up call that i did not have a slush fund/emergency fund sitting on call if i really really needed it. 

i set up a bank account with rabobank (the biggest bank in holland, i understand). anyways, here in nz they open it up without any branch visits or actual physical locations (all done online). then they provide an electronic two tier authentication device that you need to log into the internet banking every single time. 

well, that second tier device i have given to my s.o and she has put it away where i ""cant find it"". the password is all in my head (a significant event in my life, the date of which only i know and it is burnt into my memory) so i have the password- she has the keys. only when we really need it- will we access it with ""our powers combined"" (not a cpt planet reference but yes that did play out in my head r/nostalgia) 

will move it up to $1000, then put that amount into a higher earning term deposit account then move the balance up to another $1000, then rinse and repeat. in a few years time i hope to have a bunch of $1000 financial babies flapping around and hope to instill a habit of saving to my kids as well. each $1000 parcel will have its own purpose attached to it (car troubles, funeral expenses if a family member died, illness, bacon shortage on a global scale).. you get the idea.

- many people asked what car it was - audi q7! (insert childish vvvvrrrrbbooomm noise).

"i'm a married father of four in norcal. we scratched our way out of homelessness and poverty but can't seem to avoid being smothered by credit card debt. advice please!. i'll level with you all: we've weathered some rough years and need real advice to help us dig out of our debt, change our habits and get some financial stability. i've been following this group for a while but after looking into debt consolidation and bankruptcy and realizing how devastating it would be on our already bad credit, we've decided to finally bite the bullet and ask you all for help. 

background: my family spent a few years homeless following one huge and several small layoffs for both my wife and myself in a very short period of time. we lost our home, our vehicles, everything material and moved 6 times in just a couple years (always sleeping on couches or sharing one bed with our four kids… whatever it took) in pursuit of stability and jobs that always ended up falling through. three years ago a local program helped pay the deposit on an apartment and provided interview clothes and within days i landed a reliable job working for our county and we've been in that apartment and i've been working at that job ever since. i'm even expecting a raise in november. my wife recently went back to work part time to help us catch up on payments. unfortunately she can't work full time because we have to rely on family members for childcare for our four children.

two of our children overcame some pretty serious medical conditions during these past few years of stability, requiring us to live at hospitals for long periods of time. having only recently started working and barely moving into an actual apartment at the time, we relied heavily on credit cards to stay afloat during those periods, even taking out several cards and maxing them out to cover living expenses, groceries and even our own costs while staying with our children at the hospitals. i know, i know: it's bad. and just when we were finally financially recovering from the first child's medical situation, our youngest ended up in the hospital (recently) and we dug ourselves back into credit card debt all over again. 

we want to have an emergency fund. we want to have savings. we want to have financial stability and maybe even eventually buy a house. so we're asking for your help. any guidance and suggestions is deeply appreciated.

so far, we've downsized as much as we can at the moment. we live in northern california and our family of 6 lives in a tiny 800 square foot 2 bedroom/1 bath apartment. our internet/cell phone bill is the minimal speed and data plan needed for my wife's job, which requires her to work from home fairly often. basic cable comes with the apartment for free. we are also responsible for maintaining a storage unit until a family dispute has been resolved and the contents can be distributed, most likely in a couple months. we have one vehicle that we bought used about a year ago and have never been late paying on. it has $4,500 remaining to pay it off and is really only used to take the kids to school and get groceries since we walk to work. we get an excellent rate on car and renters insurance through my work, which is deducted from my paycheck with my other benefits and therefore not reflected in the following breakdown. and yes, we know the payday loans are bad but they are another product of our daughter's recent hospital situation but we are forced to renew it for the smallest possible amount each month until we can pay them off in full. we regret ever taking them out but are stuck until we can inch them down to an amount we can afford to payoff in full. at the time, it was the only way to pay rent while sleeping on folding chairs in a hospital several hours away from our home and our other children while our baby was fighting for her life. here is the complete breakdown:

**income:**

* $1,075 and $400 (so $1,475 total) bi-weekly (which will go up to $1,675 in november)

**expenses:**

* $880 rent

* $600 food ($150 per week for a family of 6)

* $450 credit card payments ($11,000 spread over 13 cards)

* $225 car payment ($4,500 remaining balance)

* $150 electricity

* $250 other necessities (diapers, wipes, toiletries, school needs, medical copays, gas)

* $100 propane

* $100 phone/internet

* $90 storage unit

* $88 monthly fees for rolling payday loan


like i said, we understand the credit cards are the biggest problem but we need advice on the best way to tackle them and start a savings so we can build an emergency fund and never have to rely on cards and payday loans again. my wife does all kinds of odd jobs from home when she can (independant writer, mystery shopper, making things to sell, you name it) to bring in bits of extra money when possible while avoiding us from having to pay for childcare for her to work full time. we did the math and she would be actually making significantly less than she does now if she worked full time and we paid for childcare. i've also been submitting applications for higher paying positions, so fingers crossed one of those comes through. in the meantime i need advice on how to tackle our situation. i've read all the guides and links in this group but we're so overwhelmed i'm not sure where to start. any help is appreciated. thank you.

**edit: a lot of people are asking why we don't qualify for more benefits or assistance programs and i realized i wasn't very clear: the income amount i provided is our net income. our gross income is much higher but 72% of our income goes to benefits and taxes. yes, i know it's a lot but the net pay is still better than i've found anywhere else (so far). our health insurance alone (just for my wife and i) is $750 each pay period (bi-weekly) for the minimal required coverage (per aca regulations). the kids still qualify for medi-cal but won't once my scheduled raise goes through in november. our younger two will also lose wic in november. we don't qualify for snap or any other programs.**",10
"the best $12/month i ever spent. i'm a recent first time homeowner in a large city. when i started paying my water bill from the city i received what seemed like a predatory advertisement for insurance on my water line for an extra $12 each bill. at first i didn't pay because it seemed like when they offer you purchase protection at best buy, which is a total waste. 

then after a couple years here i was talking to my neighbor about some work being done in the street in front of his house. he said his water line under the street was leaking and even though it's not in his house and he had no water damage, the city said he's responsible for it and it cost him $8000 to fix it because his homeowner's insurance doesn't cover it. 

i immediately signed up for that extra $12/month. well guess what. two years later i have that same problem. the old pipe under the street has broken and even though it has no effect on my property, i'm responsible. but because i have the insurance i won't have to pay anything at all!

"an unauthorized $3k tuition charge appeared in my checking acct. i graduated 2.5 years ago. the school is attempting to limit their liability. anything i can do?. hi everyone,

i posted about this yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9439ff/my_checking_account_was_compromised_and_its/)and didn't get too many responses, although luckily most of my financial issues have been resolved thanks to my mom's help.

a short version of what happened: a 3k+ charge showed as pending in my checking account from my old university (**edit to add:** i didn't recognize at first that it was from my university and thought it was a random fraud as it didn't explicitly state the university name in the ach debit description, and i graduated in 2016). i filed a fraud claim and my bank is in the process of investigating and closing my checking account. i called the university student accounts division and they have no record of that charge amount anywhere in their records for the past 2 weeks. the charge just appeared in my pending transactions overnight, and looked exactly the same (same name, same origination id, even the exact same dollar amount) of the tuition payments i made in oct/sept of 2015. i never used autopay to pay tuition and manually entered my account and routing numbers for each of the two semesters i paid tuition via e-check in 2015. i never ever authorized that they store my account/routing number.

i'm wondering now about the repercussions of my account and routing number still being on the school's servers, and them debiting my checking account without any warning, authorization, nothing.

i've spoken to the student accounts manager, but it seems the school is on lockdown mode to limit their liability, and they sent me back a very generic response. **is there anything i can do?** i'm wondering if there was a security breach on their side and while i will be protected as my checking account is being closed, other students may be at risk also. the debit would have been cleared if i hadn't called the fraud department as it apparently raised no red flags.

**edited to add:** no one at the student accounts office is picking up the phone and i am not getting an email response either.

**second edit:** i've just had a long conversation with the school's account manager and someone from their account processing department in the treasury office, and they were actually very kind. apparently this has happened to many, many students in the past week and they are working hard to track down the error and prevent it from happening again. they've also offered to pay for any fees or anything i'll incur due to having my checking account shut down which is very kind of them. it unfortunately won't help that i can't access $6k of my own money (the $4k in my frozen checking account and the $2k direct deposit that bounced today) for the next two weeks, but they are doing what they can. special thanks to u/reallygene for letting me know that ach blocks exist!!

**final edit:** thanks everyone for your responses, i read through most of them and some had very helpful suggestions moving forward. i**f i had known at first that it was the university making the charge and that it was just a billing error, i would not have initiated a closure of my account due to fraud**. however, i didn't recognize the charge until a few hours later (and combing through transactions from 3 years ago) and even when i did, i talked to the student accounts manager who said 

a) he had never heard of a the description associated with the charge 

b) they had no record of a charge in that amount being processed in the past few month and 

c) that they hadn't accessed my accounts for over 2 years (leading me to think it was truly fraud or a security breach for over 30 hours.)  

the chase fraud team highly suggested closing my account because they would not be liable to return the funds to me if i kept this account open and this happened again. thus my checking account is being closed. currently it looks like all my funds are back, but i will need to visit a branch office to open a new, verified account and transfer said funds. so everything is ok, but moving forward i'll have 2 checking accounts and space out the bill payments over the entire month. thanks everyone!

"i've been lurking a long time and have learned a lot from this community. just wanted to give back a little!. \*edit: putting this closer to the top: to use it for yourself, go to ""file > make a copy"" or ""download"" if you would prefer it in excel.

made an amortization schedule to calculate a few specific things when throwing a little extra money here and there at loans. things like how much time the loan is reduced by, new last payment date, and the amount of interest saved over the life of the loan. (i know there's resources of a lot of this here already, but here it is anyway, all in one place.)

most calculators i've found only allow input for a set additional payment, assumed monthly. i wanted to be able to include inconsistent amounts for times i fall into a little more money than usual, like a tax return or work bonus, or times i might want to skip an additional payment for whatever reason. it includes side-by-side calculations of no-extra-principal-payments and extra-principal-payments for easy comparison and good feels. it also keeps track of where you're at in the schedule, with a simple highlight. duplicate tabs for multiple loans.

just fill in the grey ""inputs"" and the most-right column as necessary, everything else is done for you (: i hope this helps someone! thank you again for all the advice, insights, and general goodwill over the years! enjoy!

"a veterinarian's perspective on personal finance and your pets. most vets are pretty bad at personal finance (we apparently think an average student loan debt of $170k and a starting salary of 60k is a good idea..) but as i lurk here quite a bit i've seen a few posts with questions about veterinary bills, insurance, etc so i thought i'd share some of my thoughts from behind the scenes.


first off, yes, veterinary bills are expensive. do bear in mind that vets are actually expected to provide modern medicine at a fraction of the cost of human medicine, even when the procedures are the same or similar. 


that being said, part of the reason that veterinary bills aren't more marked up is that the vast majority of the time, payment is expected at time of service. routinely you will be asked to leave a deposit of 50% of the estimate if you are hospitalizing your pet, and then pay the rest when h/she is discharged. i hear this advice tossed around here a lot, ""ask for a **payment plan**. most vets do payment plans"". i have worked at practices in four states and i have never seen a vet clinic that routinely offered payment plans. 


the truth is that many vet clinics are small businesses that are not set up to offer payment plans. if they didn't get paid, they couldn't keep their doors open. they would need whole separate staff to administer payment plans, plus eat the cost of clients who bailed on their payments. this would likely drive up costs for the rest of the clients. other clinics belong to a few nationwide corporations, and they've probably even stricter about not offering plans as a part of corporate policy. the few times i've seen payment plans were exceptions for trusted long-term clients, or a few cases that slipped through the cracks and we didn't have any other option. 


there are **wellness plans**, which are a completely different animal and do not address medical care for sick pets. 


the exception is that the vast majority of clinics do accept **carecredit** and highly encourage you to apply for it in case of emergency. you do need to have decent credit to qualify. if you don't qualify on your own, consider co-applying with a parent or family member. make sure to pay your carecredit bill in full before the promotional interest-free term is up, (there is no penalty for early payment), or you will be charged interest backdated to the beginning of the loan, which is awful. 


what about **pet insurance**?  there are a lot of pet insurance companies out there, some with good plans, others not so good. i would say that if you have between $3000-5000 in an emergency fund specifically for your pet, then you most likely do not need insurance. some of my clients have ""lucked out"" in the sense that they got insurance for their dog when he/she was a healthy puppy, and then developed some sort of chronic condition that needs multiple tests, follow-up tests, medication, etc, and they submit all of those claims to insurance. i have heard good things about trupanion, which generally pays out 70-90%. i've heard that pet's best provides excellent coverage - 100% after a deductible, but has expensive premiums. in general, though, you will most likely pay more for insurance than you will get out of it. i prefer the $3-5000k emergency fund - that should cover most serious illnesses, emergencies, and surgery (you may need to adjust this upwards if you are in an expensive col city). anything above that and you are probably in referral/specialty territory and may need to explore other options. 


so what are your other **options**? if you are looking at an expensive vet bill that you can't afford to incur, you should always ask your vet if there are other options. we are very used to getting this question. there are a few exemptions where there really only is one treatment, and it is a matter of life and death. generally speaking though, if a client tells us they have financial concerns/constraints, we will try to put together an alternative plan, either one that foregoes some of the diagnostic tests and relies on empirical treatments, or a less intensive treatment plan that still has a reasonable chance of success (outpatient treatment vs hospitalization, for example). if you are at an emergency/specialty center, you will most likely be able to get a less expensive option at a general practice / regular vet if it is appropriate and can wait. if your vet won't give you another option, feel free to seek a second opinion. 


one of my vet school interview questions actually asked me what i would do with a patient who has been hit by a car and has a broken leg, if the owner doesn't have money. this is for illustration purposes, but can be adapted to other situations. what i would say is:


1) ideally, getting the leg fixed by a surgeon


2) if that's not an option, amputation of the leg is much less expensive and can be performed by most general practitioners


3) if that's not an option, consider surrendering your pet. some humane societies/animal shelters, depending on their resources, will take in pets with injuries or conditions that can be treated if they will still be adoptable pets with a good quality of life. everywhere i have worked, almost all the doctors and nurses have at least one pet that they got in a situation like this. sometimes they have connections with rescue groups as well. 


4) humane euthanasia. i love pets. i think they're family. but do i think that only people with $3-5k to drop on their dog should be allowed to have pets? no. shit happens. there are lots of dogs and cats that live their whole lives without anything major happening; i only have to see them for routine vaccines. but if something terrible does happen, sometimes euthanasia is the best or our only option. we can take comfort in the fact that we gave a pet a good, loving home, and prevented them from needless suffering and neglect.


so on from that depressing topic. what are some things you can do at home to make sure your pet is the healthiest and avoids many preventable vet bills?

**preventative health care**


1) keep your pet at a healthy body weight. if you think your pet might be fat, they probably are. more helpfully, here is a body condition chart for cats: https://www.wsava.org/sites/default/files/body%20condition%20score%20chart%20cats.pdf
and dogs: https://www.wsava.org/sites/default/files/body%20condition%20score%20chart%20dogs.pdf


keeping them lean is about 99.9% diet.. i've heard so many times this winter, ""oh well he's fat because of the weather, we aren't walking as much"". then reduce his meal portions accordingly! this actually costs *less* money. can't say the same for any other medical treatment/advice. it doesn't matter how much exercise your dog gets if there's a never ending bowl of food available for him. i recommend feeding two portioned meals a day. preventing obesity reduces the risk of musculoskeletal injury, arthritis, diabetes, cancer, urinary tract problems etc. 


2) brush your dog's teeth! especially if they are a smaller breed, or one of the poster children for bad teeth: dachshunds, chihuahuas, yorkies.. bigger dogs seem to get away with less dental care, whether it's because their teeth fit better in their jaws, genetics or that they usually enjoy chewing on things that mechanically cleans their teeth. either way, i recommend at least regularly examining your dogs teeth, especially the ones in the back. daily (or at the very least every other day) toothbrushing is the most effective way to prevent plaque and tartar buildup, and save thousands in dental bills over the course of your dog's life.


edit: yes, you should also brush your cat's teeth, if possible. probably best to start when they're young!
 

if you don't have a pet yet, seriously consider rescuing rather than buying. purebred dogs are incredibly overpriced and a lot of them tend to have health problems that mixed breeds don't. purebred dogs from puppy mills/pet stores are the worst: birth defects from inbreeding, parasites, infections, etc.. if you have your heart set on a puppy, shelters regularly have puppies up for adoption, and will have already been fixed, which saves you a $300-500 surgery, and had a bunch of vaccines. if you have your heart set on a purebred, do research what their common health problems are and make sure you are equipped to deal with them.  



second edit: another money saver: it's always fine to ask for a written prescription for your pet's medications, or ask to have it called in to a human pharmacy if sold there. you can check certain websites to see what the prices of the medication would be. if the med isn't listed, it's probably a veterinary-only drug that must be sold through the vet. as far as online pharmacies, i have mixed feelings about them. they are not necessarily subject to the same regulations as brick and mortar pharmacies. their products may not be covered by the  manufacturer's guarantee. some of the products we've seen on there -- their manufacturers actually only sell direct to veterinarians, so those products are either stolen or counterfeit. i have no problem with saving clients money by writing prescriptions to  be filled elsewhere, but i am a little leery of the online ones.

"my (25) mother is completely financially dependent and it's affecting the whole family. obligatory throw-away account.  

bottom line, my mom is financially unstable and i want to know what resources there are to begin to fix it. i know there is no overnight fix but i'm not sure where to begin. 

she has gotten herself tremendously into debt and relies completely on my step-dad financially. she has a great job actually making more than he does, but she relies on him for food and a roof over her head. her bi-weekly paycheck may last at most a week. they have had marital issues for a while and if he leaves i have no idea what will happen to her or my teenage brother. inevitably i will end up having to completely support her and i want to get help before it comes to that. he has told me they probably will end it once my brother graduates high school (less than 3 years). she has virtually no financial knowledge and is completely uninterested in becoming financially independent/stable to my knowledge. she also has not seen any repercussions as someone is always there to give her money when she can't make rent, etc. 

i recently found out that my step-dad has only been putting minimal effort into keeping her accountable. he is (we think) aware of what loans/etc. she has and has provided her with a budget, but still keeps having to give her money beyond what he should. he states he has has no idea where the extra cash is going but admits to not following through to find out. she has filed bankruptcy twice and has taken out many payday loans. but i do not know yet the actual extent of how bad her situation is.... i'm under the impression that she is not being entirely honest with him.

i have only very basic financial knowledge myself, so i want to have all the resources and knowledge i can before i confront her. i want to protect the future of myself and my own family. 

we are in the us if that matters. 

tldr; mom is severely in debt and financially dependent on step-dad. most likely divorcing soon. need to know what resources there are to help her become financially stable before she becomes completely dependent on me. 




edit: wow... i am struggling to find the right words. reading as many comments/messages as i could during breaks at work, i've been fighting back tears of relief all day. 

i want to genuinely thank each and every one of you for taking the time to not only read this long depressing post, but offer your suggestions and support. this has been a dark cloud of anticipation over my head for quite some time (parents have been rocky for a while). i saw the future i've worked so hard to build for myself being slowly ripped away with every paycheck. i posted this expecting a couple responses with websites and types of financial advisors so i could do more research when i got home from work. but instead... this beauty. the idea that i would be hurting more than helping never crossed my mind, nor did the glaring fact that she doesn't *want* to be helped. why would she? she's got the gig. but also the fact i was most blind to... that this is her problem and not mine. 

i plan to talk to my step-dad tomorrow. i know he believes he's helping the family rather than enabling her. i'll give him the insight and build him up like you guys built me up, but also let him do with that what he will. because i've got my own stability to worry about!!!! they're grown!! (see guys, i'm learning!) i promise to update if anything worthy posting comes of all of this. 

just... thank you guys. you saved me from making a big mistake. ",10
"roommate spends all his time at sos apartment.. moved in with two friends in february, one roommate got a so soon after and has been spending 80% of his time at her place. almost never see him, except randomly during the week and on weekends.

&#x200b;

he recently decided that he didn't want to pay for utilities anymore.

as he is making the personal choice to spend more time at his sos place but still wants to come and go using the water and electricity and internet i do not feel his argument is valid.

&#x200b;

i say he should have to pay them as he signed a lease and when moving in together it was agreed upon that we would split everything 3 ways. he is fully aware i do not have as much financial flexibility as he does, and have to budget more strictly.

am i wrong in this situation? anybody else have a similar experience they could share?

&#x200b;

thanks!

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

update: 

&#x200b;

 

thanks for all the feedback!

the amount of time he stays with us is so variable that its near impossible to pro rate if we wanted to.

often times his so and her dog will stay with us for extended periods of time, just not as often as him being gone.

this past summer for example she and her very poorly trained dog were at the house m-friday every week for 3 months. sharing a bathroom/power etc. never asked her to pay a dime. also her dog left permanent damage to the house, which will most definitely result in us not getting our deposits back, and possible extra fines as we aren't allowed pets.

i don't feel like hes earned any sort of mercy or leniency based on his track record. i will force a sit down and go from there.

thanks again!

"made a spreadsheet to calculate weekly fun budget for 2017. ended up spending less on fun because became obsessed with increasing fun budget.. prior to 2017, i tended to spend about 40 to 50 usd per week on ""just for me"" things.  then, in late dec 2016 or early jan 2017, i decided to let google docs decide my weekly fun budget.

it's a very simple spreadsheet.  just:

expected 2017 income (fairly accurate)

(minus) overall 2017 expenses (padded)

(minus) this much to reach targeted savings amount (accurate to a dollar)

(minus) in case of emergencies (padded)

(divide) remaining amount by number of weeks left in 2017

i felt quite savvy when google docs estimated about 44$ per week.  anyway, it's now about 50$ per week because apparently, whichever sector of my brain is in charge of ""fun"" has decided that seeing this number go up is more fun than actually spending it.

"i was hospitalized earlier in the year and my boss paypaled me money as a bonus to cover hospital bills. how do i properly cover it in taxes?. just a quick question i wasn't sure of. basically i got sick and my boss paypaled me \~17k as a bonus in early 2019 to cover my out of network costs for my hospitalization. he said it was a bonus for being a good employee and he wants to treat his upper management like family. i'm wondering how i treat it on taxes so i don't get in trouble. it was the company's paypal but it was not put on our payroll whatsoever so they paid no taxes on it. do i just pay freelance taxes on it like it was a 'tip' even though i'm an employee of the company?

&#x200b;

update based on the comments:

\- i'm going to ask our company cpa even though she's not on call about how she's marking the 'gift' for this quarter or next

\- depending on her answer and my boss' answer, i'll get a cpa to make sure i'm 100% ok if i feel like there's any confusion on their end

\- i will likely file as a 1099 if they won't add it to my payroll for whatever reason, i don't feel like i can argue it's a gift since it's our company paypal even though my boss is the owner/ceo

"can't believe i was so stupid, got scammed out of 1000$.  just made a  account to write this, i haven't been feeling well these past few days, i'm trying to be a bit vague about what happened because i haven't told anyone else yet (aside from the cops).

 i'm usually doing all my online payments throw paypal, i don't know what the fuck was wrong with me this time and pushed me to do it through banking transfer (at my bank) .

 how it happened : a few weeks ago i make a online post on a website about looking for a place to rent   , a few days after i get a phone message from a person saying that he has a place for a xxx$ price (the price was kinda low and was the first signal that i ignored, though i've seen similar priced apartments online but very few) and gives me a mail address for more info about the apartment . i mail him that and by the evening he sends me the info and a few  photos, all looks great and i'm excited, he also says that he only rents through airbnb, and i'm like sure (i've never used it before , so i go and make a account). then he sends me the ""airbnb"" link using bitly , i've seen people using it online to shorten links before and don't think much about it, i see airbnb in the link the page looks legit, especially since i've never used airbnb before. 

 i go to the payment options and since i didn't have enough on my credit card i use the banking transfer option (it was to a different country: ireland) , get 4 pages everything looks alright (have to stress again that i never used airbnb before) , didn't even notice that it was arnb ats instead of air bnb above iban, and next day i make the payment, the i send a scanned copy of the payment to the fake airbnb mail address, after getting the ""confirmation"" the owner of the place says that he will come friday with the keys.

thursday i get a mail with the time when we should meet, then friday comes and i get a mail that he can't come and if i can wait until monday if not i can ask for my money back (his excuse was another red flag that i ignored and chose to believe). i reply that i can wait until monday, monday comes and he tells me that he can't come and i should ask for a refund. i mail again to the fake air bnb support account and they say i'll get my money back in 24-48 h, as the days pass and i'm not seeing my money back i'm starting to do research in to scams regarding airbnb, then i go to my bank and they tell me they can't do anything and if the money are not back soon after the 48h i should go to the police.

 by this point i should be drowning in red flags, i downloaded the airbnb app and there were no payments, i logged in the account and there were no payments made, but i still chose to believe that everything will be fine. even after going to the police and being told that i got fucked, i still believed until today when i saw the fake airbnb page disappeared.

 the police told me that they are gonna try, but since the payment was done to a bank in another country , their hands are tied and won't be able to do much, i'm 99.9% sure that i won't get my money back.

 the past few days have been really awful : couldn't sleep properly , couldn't eat ... i just don't know how to deal with this anymore, i haven't told anyone yet and i'm to afraid to do so, i just feel everything is gonna break in to pieces when it gets out...
 
tl;dr: got scammed with a fake airbnb page, made a banking transfer to another country, went to the police and they told me i'm fucked.
 
 edit 10/03 : thanks for support, you don't know how much this means to me , i don't have many friends, so i don't really have anyone to talk with . i saw many suggestions and will try to do everything possible to help me get my money back (i'm just trying to not raise my hopes up) , when i said i spoke with police i meant with the unit specialized in fraud cases, i will go again monday to them and to the bank, i will also try to contact the bank in ireland and the anti fraud unit there.

"i just found out i waste around 400$ a month because of improper food management.. i've been a cook from 16 to 23 and i usually ate at my job and bought some quick meal at the grocery store because i was too lazy to actually cook when i was at home. meanwhile, i was also a college student with not enough money to actually buy in bulk and i didn't have the will to organize my life properly. in other words, it was : many trips to fast-food restaurants, coffee machines/shops, bunch of trips to the overpriced convenience stores, etc.


lately, i've graduated from college and i now live in a rural area with my girlfriend. the rent is cheap (350$ / month for a rented house, so 700 overall), i have a good 8-5 job, and the overall cost of living is pretty cheap. but i noticed i didn't have the money i *should* have. i did a quick budget and i noticed i barely had to spend 50% of my income in all the essential stuff. and yet, i had a hard time gathering money.



well, apparently, i still had the same ""life"" i did during college, except that i bought more expensive things. i looked up my debit card record and i noticed how brutal my expenses were.


about 100-150$ monthly went to convenience stores.

about 150$ went to non-social restaurants (grabbing a subway for lunch or ordering pizza for example).


about 300$ went to the grocery store (gf spends about 150-200). way too much, considering it's for about 20 days worth of food.


it doesn't even include trips where we'd eat at the restaurant. 



so yeah, this was an eye-opener to me. it took me 5 months to realize i didn't adapt to a more serious and organized ""adult"" life. thanks god it was only 5 months, though. but ever since, i've tried making efforts at cooking food at home, buying in bulk (now that i can afford it), making my own coffee, making my own lunch for work, etc. it's not about being cheap, really. i'm still eating tasty and healthy food. it's all about being intelligent about it... and man, i'm saving a crapload of money!

"the three month rule. years ago, as i was first starting on my journey to financial stability, i had a problem with impulsive buying. not expensive things, but they would add up. so i came up with a rule for myself: i need to **want it** for more than three months before i would buy it.

this worked well, and i have since changed my behavior so much that i don't even need to follow the rule anymore. i can instantly sense when it's an impulsive buy, and when it's something i really believe would improve my life satisfaction.

so, after reading this sub for a while now, i'm curious if you have some similar rules of thumb for yourself. not necessarily for impulsive buys, but perhaps for other venues of personal finance management. something we could all learn from?
if so, please share.

---

edit: wow, so many different responses, i can't keep track anymore. thank you for all your feedback. so far i've gotten a lot of good comments.

in a nutshell, these are the best ideas i could find in the feed:

- for every 100 dollars spent do that amount of hours to do the research (100 dollars = 1 hour)

- walk around the store with the item before you buy it, called ""walking the item"" - this was the funniest one

- use wishlists to defer decision to a later time

- spending in terms of days of retirement (would i rather buy $100 item or retire two days early?)

- thinking in terms of hours worked (i need to work for x amount of hours to buy this. is it worth it?)

- a variation on the above one, where you first deduct your living expenses, what remains you calculate into hourly wage that you *really* have at your disposal and only then consider how many hours you need to work for it

- buying only after running x number of miles (works both for impulse buys and getting yourself in shape)

- the old 'if you can't afford two of those, you can't afford one' was very common and very popular (a variation on this with a 3x approach(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ktr6u/the_three_month_rule/djq4357/))

- a lot of jokes how you can't do this with food (teasing me about the three month thing)

- and other that said they do that for food as well (obviously not in terms of not eating, but rather in terms of eating certain junk foods they like)

- buy memories, not things

- practicing artificial scarcity. this one is a bit trickier to explain so i'll let the original comment speak for itself(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ktr6u/the_three_month_rule/djpaw4u/)

- think about the dollar per use ratio. so if it's something you won't use often, how expensive is it? is it worth it?

- take a picture of the item you want while shopping. at home look at the pictures and do the research. usually you realize you didn't really want it by then

i hoped i would get more that weren't for impulse buys, like i stated above... other personal finance life hacks, but i'm sure these rules of thumb can be used by others.

also, my mailbox is full, sorry i can't respond to all of you. i really tried :)

my steps i can infer myself are:

find a better paying job as is

learn a skill to improve job hours, regularity and open my schedule for schooling.

find an affordable school in south east pennsylvania where i will be eligible for in state tuition in 10 months

i am aware of mit's advertised free online courseware and have an interest in computer science, health/nutrition as well as math. i just don't know the path of achieving and completing these steps so to apply them in my overall goal of financial progress. what are my options to advance my career away from retail management, and educate myself into a position where i can choose a career path that is more fulfilling and financially secure? 

i am aware many people are on here trading tips on stocks, putting away for retirement, playing with amounts of money i don't make in a year and that's great, i can strive for that but first and foremost my goal is to continue to feel stable on my feet, as i currently feel that something like my car breaking down, or substantial speeding ticket for instance would result in financial ruin.

she does not care about me or my future, or if she does she does it's not much and she never shows it, i feel like she would be content if i wasted my life rotting in this house for more years than i've already done.

my health is in a bad state, i have physical and mental illnesses, but i feel like i can't help myself to get better while i'm here, because staying here keeps me in a depressive state.

edit: many people are saying that's reasonable for her to take for food and rent, but she would keep the remaining money if there was some, and paying 500 for rent+food is a bit different than what i have which is rent+food+grief/hate. also, it's going up to 800 next month it looks like (from ss website member page).

i contacted a social services worker to be put on a waiting list for housing for mentally ill with some limited assistance with living, but the list takes up to 2 years. i think this would be ideal but it's also only opportunity i'm aware of.

"thanks to r/personalfinance my cousin's girlfriend successfully avoided a scam.. thanks so much to u/fateofmorality for posting this(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/62eefp/girlfriend_applied_for_a_job_within_24_hours_they/?st=j1gorjus&sh=45a10177) to r/personalfinance ! a couple days ago, my cousin was talking to his girlfriend about a new job she's been trying to get. after a bit of inquiring, he said that it was for $46/hour w/ no experience necessary, and that he was going to try to get it too. it sounded too good to be true, but it was none of my business.
 fast forward to today, he told me his girlfriend got the job, and they sent her a check that she was about to cash (~$2400) to buy equipment. immediately i remembered that post, and fortunately i was able to find it and show him this is a common scam. i didn't want to rain on their parade or seem jealous that she got a ""well paying job"", so i told them just to call the bank on the check just to be sure. his girlfriend was literally waiting in line at her bank, right about to deposit it, when he called her to check...sure enough it was fraudulent and she's contacting the local fraud department to report this!

edit: this is in phoenix, az...be careful out there

edit 2: glad a lot of people could read this! it's really important (i especially learned today) to be ~~weary~~ wary of ""too good to be true"" situations! ask questions and be skeptical!

edit 3: i think i now have a pretty good understanding on how the scammer makes money off of this now. they send you a fake check, but the bank lets it go through for your own convenience; you then buy the scammer's ""equipment"" (the vendor you get the equipment is also a scam, just to get your money, you never get the supplies that you payed for), but the bank eventually figures out the check is bogus, takes the full amount out of your account, even if you go negative in which case they'll demand you pay the amount asap or forgo repercussions.

"i negotiated a $12,000 hospital bill to $1,500. my wife got diagnosed with cancer this past june and we were uninsured. we finally got insurance through the aca in july, but she had a $12,000 procedure done earlier in june. i set this bill up on a payment plan with the hospital but i was struggling because i left my job back in january. my wife's cancer is terminal so she requires full time care leaving me unable to seek employment at the moment. 

after reading some advice here, i spoke to their billing department and asked how one might qualify for financial assistance. they sent me some paperwork in the mail asking about our situation and to provide justification along with any documentation. i provided a verification of my employment dates, my lay off notice from my employer, a copy of the unemployment payments made to me, and wrote a statement explaining my wife's cancer and my inability to join the work force. 

two weeks later they sent a notice stating we've been approved for a reduced payment of 90%, now owing approximately $1,500. 

what a huge burden that's been lifted off my shoulders. 

i hope this info helps someone else. 

*edit* - people arguing with me over the semantics of the word negotiated. you're right. wrong word to use. 

the actual bill was not exactly $12,000 but very close. 

as for not getting cobra, the premium was $1,000 a month for my wife and i. she is 29 and i am 34. both relatively healthy and have never been to the doctor. we blew it off. blew off the aca too. huge mistake and life lesson harshly learned. ",10
"some insights into the answer to ""why did my refund go down when i entered a second w-2 form into my tax software???"". as tax filing season gets underway, people are starting to post queries indicating confusion about why their tax software shows a big refund when they've only entered one of several w-2s and then that refund indicator drops to a smaller refund or even says they owe taxes as they enter other w-2s.

this can happen whether you are a single taxpayer with multiple w-2s or are married taxpayers filing jointly who both have incomes.

the reason this happens is the interim ""refund"" value isn't really a valid figure, because it is misrepresenting what your income is and how it gets taxed.

i'll give some numeric examples to illustrate, but first it may help to know that your w-4 ""allowances"" setting is going to influence how much of the income you earn at one job is going to be considered untaxed by the withholding system as it estimates your yearly tax in order to figure out what to withhold from any particular check.

in 2017, for single filers:  

considered not taxed = 2300 + 4050 * allowances

in 2017, for married filers:

considered not taxed = 8650 + 4050 * allowances

let's see how this plays out in some scenarios. i'm using 2017 tax numbers here, since right now people are struggling with interpreting their 2017 tax situations.

---

example a: single filer with two jobs all year

suppose you are a single filer with a 24k job and a 36k job and on both your w-4s you put ""0"" allowances, thinking that would cause more than typical withholding. let's say the 24000 job had 2789 withheld and 36000 job had 4589 withheld, which is likely amounts for full year withholding.  

job 1: 24000 wages, 2789 withheld using s-0  
job 2: 36000 wages, 4589 withheld using s-0

let's see what happens when you enter just job 1 w-2 into typical tax software. here is what the software interprets is happening.

income = 24000

deduction = 10400

taxable income = 13600

income tax = 9325 * 10% + 4275 * 15% = 1574

payments = 2789

""refund"" = 2789 - 1574 = 1215 (yay!)

i put the refund in scare quotes because this is an invalid number, since only one income has been entered. if this were your only income, you would indeed get this amount of refund. and this refund number certainly gets you thinking that the withholding at the first job was more than enough. 

---

what happens if instead you enter just job 2 w-2 into software? similarly, it would tell you you're getting a refund if that's your only income.

income = 36000

deduction = 10400

taxable income = 25600

income tax = 9325 * 10% + 16275 * 15% = 3374

payments = 4589

""refund"" = 4589 - 3374 = 1215 (yay!)

by the way, the apparent ""refund"" is the same in this example because in each case the withholding system was told to use ""0"" allowances instead of ""2"" allowances, and this made the withholding system imagine your income in each job would be 4050 * 2 = 8100 more than it really was, which causes about 8100 * 15% = 1215 too much withholding to happen for that job considered by itself.

in other situations, you may find that the nonsense ""refund"" values you see when you decide to switch the order of entering w-2 will be different, as a consequence of how allowances settings were done and what tax bracket each income seems to put you in.

notice that no matter which w-2 you enter, the withholding systems believe that some income is not taxed, some is taxed at 10%, and some is taxed at 15%, but no income is taxed at 25%. this turns out not to be true when you actually compute your tax.

----

let's see what happens when you enter the second w-2 after entering the first w-2. now the software has your actual total income information and total withholding information, and the final result is valid.

income = 24000 + 36000 = 60000

deduction = 10400

taxable income = 49600

income tax = 9325 * 10% + 28625 * 15% + 11650 * 25%

= 932.50 + 4293.75 + 2912.50

= 8139

payments = 2789 + 4589 = 7378

""amount owed"" = 8139 – 7378 = 761 (hey!)

instead of getting a refund, you actually owe about 761. yikes!

----

what happened?

was something ""wrong"" with the withholding at job 2? not really. no more than what was wrong with the withholding at job 1.

your withholding wasn't actually enough. 

using single 0 w-4 settings at both jobs wasn't enough to account for the actual tax, because some of the income really does get taxed at 25% when you ""stack"" your two incomes together. 

one way of thinking about this is that the withholding systems at both jobs effectively thought of this as how the income falls into brackets:

considered not taxed: 2300 + 2300 = 4600 (because of use of ""0"" allowances)  

considered taxed at 10%: 9325 + 9325 = 18650

considered taxed at 15%: 12375 + 24375 = 36750

considered taxed at 25%: nothing

in reality, when the two incomes are combined, this is how the actual income falls into brackets:

not taxed: 10400

taxed at 10%: 9325

taxed at 15%: 28625

taxed at 25%: 11650

although the withholding had a low value 4600 for tax-free space compared to reality of 10400, the withholding had a very skewed idea of how big the tax bracket spaces are, so the withholding systems interpreted more of the income as being taxed in lower brackets.

it's not fruitful to blame the withholding at each job. at each job, the withholding system is just following the instructions conveyed by ""0"" allowances, and it is hamstrung by not knowing the total income. each job treats your income as if it's the only job. 

solution: this taxpayer should have considered using s-0, s-0 settings but also have extra withholding taken from paychecks to send in about 760 more tax across the entire year. extra withholding of $30 from biweekly paychecks at one of the jobs would have been enough. however, owing 760 at tax time isn't going to cause this taxpayer any underpayment penalty, because it's under $1000 shy.

tldr: if your overall withholding was not enough, it's still possible for you to see an apparent interim ""refund"" value when you enter just one w-2 into tax software. you need to ignore this interim value because it doesn't represent a real refund you could get, since it is not based on knowing about all your income and all your withholding. also, you should not blame the second job as having faulty withholding.

"what's the smartest decision to make during/after college?. my girlfriend and i are making our way through college right now, constantly theorizing our future together. we are certain we'll have solid careers in the next 4-5 years. but it's pretty unclear what's the best course of action when we finally get jobs... get a house before or after marriage? travel as much as possible? work hard for a decade, then travel? we have a couple ideas about which direction to head but would love to hear from people/couples who have been through this transition from college to the real world. our end goal is to travel as much as possible but without breaking the bank. 

edit: i'm majoring in international business and logistics. my gf is majoring in mechanical engineering. both of our colleges require multiple internships. also, i didn't ask for relationship advice, just looking for financial insight. ",10
"after 18 months, my wife and i paid off $93k in student loans and are now debt free. time to save for a house!. i don't really have any particularly interesting methods to share, just the tried and true stuff you've seen on here a million times. i will share none the less, because it never hurts to hear good advice more than once! also, i think getting everyone's unique perspective on the situation can be interesting. and who doesn't like a feel good story? right?

so to start with, some background about us. i'm 30, she's 27, and we've been together for over 12 years, married for 3. we started dating in high school! so i guess based on that fun fact alone we're already beating the odds. all of the student loans were hers. when i went to college i was in a bad place in my life, struggling with depression, living with an alcoholic father after an insanely long and bitter divorce of my parents, and generally feeling unmotivated to do anything. so... i didn't, and my grades in college were proof of that. i was put on academic probation after my first semester. my grades didn't improve in my second semester, and i was asked to take a semester off. i just never went back. this was probably the lowest point of my life. 

luckily for me, the only thing i was ever truly passionate about was computers, and i had taken up programming as a hobby in my spare time which would ultimately become my career. i guess when you're depressed it's easy to hide in the basement playing on the computer all day every day. shortly after dropping out of college a very lucky series of events occurred. one of my dad's good friends who just happened to be in charge of hiring software developers for a small business gave me an opportunity to come in and interview for a full-time software developer position. so in i went, barely 20 years old, with my only experience being working for a grocery store, fresh from dropping out of college. the interview was a bit awkward to say the least. but... just kidding. no but. they didn't hire me. i was told they hired some hot-shot self-starter with tons of experience instead who was going to hit the ground running and that sounded more appealing than training me as the greenest programmer in the world i suppose. needless to say i was pretty bummed about this, but (here's the *real* but) if memory serves me, i believe it was no more than about 6 weeks later that i got a call back from the company. they told me that the other guy wasn't working out, he was a bad fit culturally and wound up not being as much of a self-starter as advertised. point is, he was out, and i was given the opportunity -- literally -- of a lifetime.

i think i received that call on a friday, and started the next monday... at $12 per hour. oh yeah, you read that right. this isn't one of those ""i'm a software engineer making $180k straight out of college"" stories. i grinded this career out to get to where i am now 10 years later, and i'm not exactly the highest paid software engineer even today. i developed a work ethic almost immediately and made a point to always be the nicest guy in the office having heard all the things everybody said about the previous hire. doing the work was easy since i was naturally interested in programming and had been doing it for fun. that company treated me extremely well. i worked there for 9 years, and only quit about a year ago. when i quit i was making $19/hr, but was making *substantial* profit sharing bonus every year in the range of $20k+. leaving was one of the hardest decisions of my life because they treated me so well personally and the office culture was so great, but the finances just didn't work out. i had more than earned a fair market value with my years of service, and $19/hr wasn't cutting it, even with the massive profit sharing bonuses. those bonuses were actually one of the primary motivations for me to leave, because having a bonus sounds nice, but when your bonus comes on a monthly basis and represents ~35% of your take-home pay, it stops feeling like a bonus and starts feeling like a necessity. when the company finally stopped growing and i saw my pay checks dwindle, i knew it was time to go searching for a more fair market value, and i found one. so now i have a stable salary of $72k instead of an incredibly volatile salary of anywhere from $40k-$65k depending on the year, and i feel like i have plenty of room to grow. i should mention i live in nebraska, so money goes a long way here. $72k is above the curve in general.

my wife's story is basically the polar opposite of mine, so this is going to be short. she has a loving family that are all the nicest most supportive people ever, and she is an absolutely phenomenal student who was always a hard worker with perfect grades. she earned her undergraduate degree in psychology, and attended graduate school where she earned an educational specialist degree, which apparently is slightly more school than a masters degree, but not as much as a phd. she just started her career 2 years ago working as a school psychologist for the local school district here earning about $48k. she worked through school before that doing various jobs like waiting tables and fast food. so until she started her career job, we basically lived on my income.

so the finances as of today are that we have a combined income (gross) of $120k, and we live in the midwest where it's cheap to live. so it hasn't exactly been difficult to destroy this pile of student loans as quickly as we did.

one big aspect that helped us tremendously is that we've always been a team. i've always earned significantly more than she did, meanwhile all $93k of those student loans were in her name, but this has never for a second been a point of contention for us. we've always been on the same team, and we both are very naturally frugal. 

we of course set a budget, and stuck to it. we cook all our own meals and rarely eat out. we cut the cable 6+ years ago and have been paying only for internet. both of us have reasonable cars that we paid cash for with no car payments. we both have cheap hobbies, and are in general just allergic to spending money. we joke about how silly it is for us to ""go shopping"" because usually what happens is we'll be bored on a weekend and head to the store knowing that we want to buy something. then we'll get to the store and scoff at the price tags, and resolve to go home and buy it on amazon instead. then we'll sleep on it, and never buy it. 

oh yeah, and not having kids of course has helped. probably should have mentioned that earlier.

i've been contributing to a retirement account since i started my career at age 20 and my wife did the same just a few years ago. i'm almost to 6 figures in my retirement!

when she graduated there was immense pressure from friends and family to just rush into buying a house. this was before i got my new job with a more stable salary, but we made the choice to eliminate all the debt first, especially with all the uncertainty with my job.

we've paid navient apparently ~$5k per month for 18 months. it hurt. but it's done. here is my favorite screenshot ever(http://i.imgur.com/wyeqke4.png)

it feels great to be debt free! now we're hoping to put that same saving power towards a down payment on a house when our lease is up in ~10 months. and with our new found purchasing power thanks to not having debt, we'll be able to afford any house we could possibly imagine. but of course, we're still going to pick something that's well below our means. here in nebraska the most extravagant house i could possibly imagine living in would be in the ~$350k range, so we're shooting for no more than $250k instead.

if you have any other questions, ask away. i'm sure i skipped something.

"side gigs are great, but remember not to let them take over your life. since 2013, i have been working over 60 hours a week in one way or another. twice because i had very demanding jobs, and all the others because i was working side gigs. i've worked nights in a restaurant, freelance written after work, and worked in promotional events on weeknights and weekends.

from a financial standpoint, it was a fantastic boost for my goals. i was always making $15/hr or less, and usually in temp jobs. i needed more security. (as of march, i have a new permanent job that pays $20/hr. remember this, it's important later.)

i paid off my student loans in 7 months, got out of $4,000 in credit card debt, saved $10,000, and was able to move into my own apartment where i live alone.

i finally settled into my place about a month ago, and i've had a lot of time to think. i was looking at my budget thinking and wondering what the next ""thing"" was. use side money to begin contributions to an ira? get enough money saved for a down payment on a car when mine kicks the bucket? extra money for a vacation? but nothing was immediate. that was frustrating, so i had to think more about what the side gigs could help me with. 

during this time, i also started thinking about a lot of opportunities i missed because of my side gigs. i had to decline friends' invitations to hang out, visiting my family, and taking up hobbies. i also did not focus as much on things outside of my main job that could have improved my main income, like networking and doing a little outside research.

i realized something: i was becoming a robot. i was not truly involved in the things i was doing - just going through the motions to get the money i needed. i felt empty knowing there was nothing left financially to achieve... and that made me feel kind of pathetic. my life had revolved around making money. i didn't even know what was going on in my friends' lives, and i couldn't answer ""what do you like to do in your free time?"" outside of making money and pushing myself to meet goals. 

on top of that, there was no longer a need to be a robot. i made enough now to live comfortably and save way more than $200 per month. i'll be eligible for the 401k next year. we get yearly col raises and bonuses. there was no reason to continue busting my ass when i had enough now to live in my means, and a little more, and i was in a healthy financial place. 

so two weeks ago, i decided to stop all forms of outside money-making. the only thing i will continue to do is one summer gig that doesn't pay well, but genuinely makes me happy and doesn't eat too much of my time. things are already changing for the better. i've had more time to study for my job (which my boss has noticed and was impressed i took initiative on) - that will mean doing my job better, and getting a better raise next year. i have also talked to my friends and family on the phone more and found out what's going on with them. even having the space to make healthy meals and exercise has been a huge benefit for my mood.

and, i did carve out space in my budget for saving for a new car and some vacations. while continuing to put away towards my emergency fund.

side gigs are excellent opportunities to get yourself out of bad financial situations. overall i don't regret it - but in hindsight, i wish i had made a game plan to know when to stop. it's easy to become addicted to the extra income, but it's not worth it at your own expense as a human being. side gigs are just that - something you do on the side because it's either fulfilling or getting you out of a bad spot, not a permanent band aid.

i didn't expect my rant to be this long! but i hope it helps others not lose themselves in the pursuit of money.

edit: just wanted to say that i love the discussions happening in the comments. it's great to hear the pros and cons of side gigs, when to halt and when to take it to the next level, and all the gray area and special circumstances around the gigs and ""side job"" culture. you hear ""find a second method of income"" as part of a lot of financial advice, but there's much more to it than just showing up and waiting for the money. thank you all for your input!",10

"don't give up on financial fitness even when you hit rock bottom. my fiance left me (she wanted to see other people) with 2k in credit card debt, i had 20k in student loans (she had 37k) and i had moved 300 miles away from my family to be with her (she wanted to be close to her family). i was destroyed beyond belief as you could imagine. as soon as she left me i focalized my pain and anger in a positive way. i decided to apply to 82 different jobs near my family. i got 3 interviews, i nailed them all but out of instinct i followed with one in particular. i ended up getting the job so i could finally move out of the apartment with all of her stuff giving me harsh daily reminders of a failed engagement. my pay raise was jumping from 50k to 80k!! i lived in that depressing hell box alone for 2 months while she lived with her parents. when i moved i started changing my financial life. she wanted loans for our wedding (before she dumped me) which i hated but thought, i mean it is our big day. i dropped that crappy debt ideology she thought was 'okay' and changed my views! here we are now, in 6 months since starting my new job, i have my own apartment, my credit cards are paid off and i am down to 10k on my student loans, with a 2k rainy day fund, 1k in my hsa, and with a maximum 401k contribution. 

advice: my advice for you guys and gals, when you hit rock bottom, remember to bounce hard so you can go higher at a faster speed. focus your negative emotions (anger and sadness) and turn those thoughts and feelings into productivity. you can do this. also, disassociate yourself from those who put you into financial stress, its unhealthy and stressful, you will be amazed at your potential when you surround yourself with people who root for financial freedom.",10

starting day one, i kept a field notes traveling salesman edition notebook in my center console and logged the date, mileage, $/gal and amount of gas every time that i filled up. looking back on the graph, you really can see inflection points during some of my major life events (job changes, extended vacations, etc).

* total gas used: 4114.286 gal
* total cost: $10,149.57
* avg $/gal: $2.50
* avg mpg: 26.2


**maintenance, insurance, etc**
i have tried to be very strict with my preventative maintenance on the car so that i can drive it for a loooooong time. i have gotten oil changes every ~6000 miles (full synthetic) and tire rotations on a similar interval. i have had to buy 2 new sets of tires over the 108,000 miles in 5+ years which have included free rotation, balance and nail repair (shout out discount tire!). general consumables, i have replaced myself including brake pads, air filters, cabin air filters, broken interior door handle, wiper blades.

i have had 2 minor non-warranty repairs done on the car over 5 years which were paid for out of pocket.they were: a/c fan clutch & related parts ($1205) and dent on the driver f & r doors from being backed in to ($1318). having only 1 mechanical failure after 108,000 miles is pretty impressive.

* number of oil changes: 19
* oil change cost: $1086.90
* general parts: $334.51
* repair - non-warranty: $2522.33
* tires: $1254.42 
* insurance: $7319.71
* registration/inspections: $1144.75


overall, the total cost of ownership comes out to $42,301.44 (see graphs(https://imgur.com/a/9eo2t) for specifics) at time of writing with the odometer reading 108,657. this comes out to a **tco/mile of $0.39**, which it significantly less than the irs standard rate. i am happy with my purchase as it has been a very reliable car, **however** i do not think that i will purchase a brand new car next time that i am in the market for a vehicle. 

let me know what you think about my breakdown and my financial decision to buy a new car as a 22yr old individual.

"going to jail for 3 months. best steps to take?. in a week and a half i may be going to jail for 3 months. what steps should i take to prepare financially for this?

i have 7,000 dollars in my personal bank account, and about 5,000 dollars in a joint account with my wife. i have a good paying job right now where i bring home about 600/week, (2,500/month). we also have really good health insurance from there. my wife just started a part time job giving horse riding lessons.

our monthly expenses include 825/rent, 65/electric, 160/auto insurance, 200/food, 80/miscellaneous.

i will lose my job and most likely will not get rehired by them once i get out. i will have at least 2,000 in fines once i'm out. i will only find out september 5th what the full extent of this will be.

any advice on what to do to secure my money before i'm gone and be in the best financial situation possible when i come back?",10
"when buying a car from a dealer, are there any add-ons or extras that actually are a good idea to select?. this sub is full of ways dealers coerce or even trick buyers into purchasing extra stuff they don't need when they get you in the back room to do the payment and financing for a car.

"i received a bill from my old dentist for services from 2014. i found proof i paid, now they won't answer the phone.. in 2014 for a period of 4 months i did a teeth whiting treatment. it was expensive, around $750, but i was getting married in 2015 and it was worth it to me. i paid each of the 3 visits in full before leaving the dentist.

years earlier at a minute clinic, i had an issue because the office told me the services were covered by my insurance, which was a mistake. i got a bill 6 months later for the treatment which i barely remembered having. ever since then i have never left a doctor's appointment, dentist, or anything else without making a full payment for whatever services were performed.

so the treatment concluded at the end of 2014 and i leave for another dentist. fast forward to the middle of 2015 and i received a bill for a past due payment of $239 dollars. i called the office twice and left 2 voicemails. in the second voicemail i said i think the bill is a mistake, if you need any help clearing it up please call me.

fast forward to yesterday. some of my old mail goes to my parents home and i picked up yesterday. in the bundle was a bill from a different dentist for $239 with a handwritten note saying ""your immediate attention is required"". 

so i called them this morning and it turns out the dentist changed names and locations. after clarifying that i told them it isn't possible to have a balance, i paid each visit in full before leaving. the woman on the phone said that the whiting wasn't covered by insurance, and i only paid $500 of the $739. i said again, that isn't possible, i paid every visit in full.

she told me that i need to prove to her i made the payments and she would apologize and fix my account. i asked her when my last visit was and she couldn't tell me ""she didn't have that information"". she rushed me off the phone and told me she would call me back when she wasn't so busy.

i save my old bank statements and was able to dig up the ones from 9/14,10/14, and 12/14 which show me making payments of $239, $250, and $239. 

with proof i called them back and they didn't answer. i called back again and left a voicemail. i called back again and it made the noise like a fax machine. any other office and i wouldn't have a problem but this office has done this before with not answering the phone. i don't want to get a call from collections saying i owe them money in a few months time. my wife and i are looking to buy a home soon so my credit score can't take a hit because of this foolishness. they are only 30 minutes away. should i drive to them and speak to them in person? what would happen if they send me to collections? even though i am in the right could it negatively impact my credit?

tl;dr i paid for the dentist in full, 3 separate payments. dentist doesn't have record of one of the payments and has sent me bills for the services performed in 2014. my bank statements prove i made all the payments. i keep calling them and they won't answer.


**edit:** thanks for all of your responses! i have off from work tomorrow so i will be going in to the office in person. 


**edit 2:** thanks for all the advice and feedback. also thank you for the pm's telling me i couldn't count. i did make a mistake in my initial post, my payments were $250, $250, and $239, those 3 payments along with an $11 bill credit from a previous over-payment totaled the $750 procedure. 


i drove to the new dentist today and the office was really nice, but it smelled like burger king. i had no idea why, but it didn't matter to me because i just wanted this done. i brought with me my account statements from september, october, and december of 2014. the woman at the front desk tried to make copies of them and i stopped her. the paperwork had my account number and i wasn't letting her copy that. 

i had them print out a full account summary of all services and payments during my entire run with the dentist. i then requested a print out of the final bill, totaling $0.00 owed. after she bit into her burger, she printed the bill for me confirming that i now owe them nothing and their system has been updated.

so, there are really two victories here. i get to wash my hands of them with proof i owe them nothing, and i found out why a dentist would smell like burgers. 

thanks for all your advice!!",10
"my mom just informed me she's paying $100 a month to a company for a car that was repossessed back in 2010?. she mentioned it to me this morning and said that she doesn't remember who's taking the money out, but she said right after it got taken away she got a phone call from some place saying she would go to jail if she didn't pay so apparently she been paying a$100 a month for 8 years. this sounds so fishy and was wondering has anybody heard of something like this before?",10
"i found on credit karma that my deceased grandmother has 80 shares of sherwin williams in her name unclaimed since 2006.... since we live in texas, i believe that these should still be intact and unsold. i confirmed that these existed on the missing money site suggested through the government and am waiting for a response from the state of texas. my mom lives in my grandmothers (now my mom's) house which is the address the unclaimed property is listed under. i'm wondering how much these shares are valued at now? this could really help my mom who is struggling to pay off a lot of debt accrued in the last 10 years. any additional steps i should take? 

edit: much larger response on this than i ever could have expected. hopefully this brings about some awareness to others and many are successful in claiming their own small or large sum of unclaimed funds that are out there. i'll update as i go through the process but am hoping for the best (full value of shares) expecting the worst (smaller value of shares if sold prior to my claim). cheers to anyone finding money for themselves or their loved ones. who knew my grandmother could pick stocks eh?

"salary increase, never enough?. i started my job in 2015, making $45k. three years and a few promotions later, i'm at $85k. my paycheck is nearly double what it used to be, i've almost entirely avoided lifestyle creep, and the majority of that increase is going straight to retirement/other investments. 

i still find myself feeling like its not enough. like, i'll find myself scrolling through part-time weekend jobs seeing if there's anything i can pick up to pull down a few hundred more dollars a month. there's no real reason for this- i'm underpaid at work, but not severely, and i have no major purchases or life events i'm saving for/putting on hold because i can't afford them.

"can i tell a debt collector to stop calling my employees at work?. i am a store manager at a busy coffee shop in ontario canada and i have a debt collector calling to speak to one of my baristas. 

it is often busy and inconvenient for me to pull her off the floor when they call, so i would take down their phone number and pass the message on. this didn't stop the calls because i suppose my employee never returned them. regardless, not my problem, right? 

finally, after having to pick up the phone during a heavy rush and sacrifice our store's speed of service to grab it, i asked these people to stop calling her at work. 

i explained that she's busy at the moment and has no voicemail to be forwarded to, and in fact, i myself am too busy to spend the time to take down a name, phone number and lengthy reference number. i told her i was the manager of the store and asked her to please stop calling my employee at work, and use her other contact numbers instead. 

the calls have persisted and i just got into a verbal altercation with this collector, letting her know to stop calling because i was not going to pay for my employee to be taking calls when there are customers to be served. she got rude, spoke over me and started yelling that this was a very important matter and she would continue to call until she got through, regardless of what i said. 

what are my rights here? are there any magic words to get these people to stop calling my employee at work? just did a search of laws against debt collectors and i know if my employee asks them to stop, they have to. but do i have the right to ask them to stop? is there a legal line i can use on this person next time they call? 



***update***

since my update got buried in new comments below, i'll state it here. i have discussed with my employee and we decided together that next time they call for her, i will put the phone on speaker, use my phone to record, and she will tell the collector that she's not to be contacted at work anymore. this is a rule in the ontario law that further calls are a violation of. hopefully it works. 

also editing to say to all those who say to just call the phone provider to block the calls: our phone bills are paid by corporate, i don't even know who the provider is. and i am not authorized to make changes to the plan. 

for those that say don't answer or just hang up: we have no caller id to screen calls. 

and i can't hang up because it could be her daughters school calling which has happened before so i always have to ask ""may i ask who's calling?"" which is still a waste of my time. also just hanging up will allow the disturbing calls to continue, which means myself or my other employees have to step away from the customers we are serving, walk to the phone, and take the time to answer. yes of course we could hang up after that but the distraction is still occurring and i just want the calls to stop. 

those that say to fire her: she's a 10+ year employee  and doesn't deserve to get fired over phone calls that she has tried to but can't stop. 

those that say i should pay her a living wage. i am a manager for a corporate chain and can't pay her more.  she's also making $4 above minimum wage and i'd say for a barista, that's pretty damn good. not to mention i don't think paying her more would make her pay more debt. 

those that say this is her fault and she should pay: obviously, i agree. but i file this into the ""not my problem"" category. i am not her financial advisor, i'm her boss. if she comes to me for help i will offer her what advice i can but ultimately i think this just boils down to her family being irresponsible with spending, and i just want the phone at work to stop ringing. 

and finally for those that say i should tell the person she's fired. two things. firstly the creditor will still call back. then another employee when i'm not there may say ""yep she works here still."" secondly they can call corporate office and get verification of her employment so i am choosing not to tell a lie that will be figured out anyway. 

hopefully that clears some of all this up since i can't keep up with comments. who knew my post would blow up like this! ",10
"despite 1/4 of the workforce qualifying for public service loan forgiveness, only 139 people have made substantial progress in completing the required payments. just read this article that chronicles one of the first people in the u.s. to have his student loan debt forgiven under the program. the amount of diligence he undertook to ensure he was on the right plan, was making the right type of payments, and that all his payments were being kept track of properly is astounding.

i never qualified for pslf, but given the low success rate of people in the program, i will definitely think twice before recommending it to someone here at r/personalfinance or elsewhere (not that it isn't potentially valuable, but if it's this difficult to jump through all the hoops, it might not be the right choice for everyone that qualifies).

article (new york times, soft paywall): public servants do get student loan forgiveness. meet one of the first. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/your-money/student-loan-forgiveness.html

regarding the title, the actual statistic is: ""while the consumer financial protection bureau has estimated that one-quarter of the united states work force could potentially qualify for the forgiveness program, only 139 people had made at least 97 qualifying payments toward their goal of 120 as of 2016, according to figures that the department of education presented at a conference.""",10
"real world example of why using a credit card is safer than debit. i use my capital one credit card for virtually everything and then pay my balance off every week.

last night at 9 pm while watching  tv, i got a text alert from capital one asking if i had made a certain charge.  it was definitely a place i had not been to in years (and my physical card was in my wallet), so i responded ""no"" and was given a fraud alert number to call.

after spending 10 minutes on the phone with a fraud specialist, it appears my card had been ""skimmed"" and the number was being used multiple times at multiple places in new york state (thousands of miles from where i live).

the agent immediately froze the card, credited all charges, and opened up a fraud report.  case closed.

if the exact scenario had happened with a debit card, no immediate credit would have been given, and i would have had to wait for a bank to complete an investigation before getting any of my money back.  this sometimes takes weeks or even months, depending on the bank.

hopefully, this anecdote will help out someone that frequently uses their debit card for purchases.

"the collision center lost my car. i was in an auto accident monday and i had it towed to the dealership i bought the car from originally before i contacted my insurance. after i contacted my insurance i decided to have it towed to autonation collision center which is a recommended collision center with my insurance. 

i called autonation yesterday to check in as it was 2 days after the accident and i heard absolutely nothing from them. they claimed they do not have the car so i called my insurance and to see what the deal was so they checked with their tow company to see what happened and the tow company said the first collision center i towed it to did not have the vehicle, or that is what they claimed.

i plan on going up there so i can walk to lot to see if i find it myself. i honestly don't know what to do after this point if they find it or not, any advice? 

update: the car was found at the first collision center once my insurance said if the car is not found i would report it stolen with them being the last known person in possession of it, then magically they found it within 5 minutes.

double update: just got back from the new collision center. my car was the same as i left it at the first, so i took the roof rack and paddles out as that was the only expensive stuff. after some advice from the comments they recommend me take it from autonation and take it to caliber collision, so i may end up doing that as autonation said they can't even look at it until late tomorrow but most likely monday.",10
"if you haven't filed your us federal tax return yet because you owe and can't pay, file it by june 14 to avoid the higher late-filing penalty.. taxpayers who owe tax and file their federal income tax return more than 60 days after the deadline will generally face a higher late-filing penalty. ordinarily, the late-filing penalty, also known as the failure-to-file penalty (ftf), is assessed when a taxpayer fails to file a tax return or request an extension by the return due date. this penalty, which only applies if there is unpaid tax, is usually 5 percent for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late.

if a tax return is filed more than 60 days after the april due date -- or more than 60 days after the october due date if an extension was obtained -- the minimum penalty is either $210 or 100 percent of the unpaid tax, whichever is less. this means that if the tax due is $210 or less, the penalty is equal to the tax amount due. if the tax due is more than $210, the penalty is at least $210. the late-filing penalty will stop accruing once the taxpayer files a complete and correct return.

the ftf penalty does not apply to the taxpayers who met this year's april 18 deadline to file their individual tax return. it also won't apply to the taxpayers who asked the irs for a six-month extension of time to file, as long as they file by oct. 15, 2018. 

in addition, the irs urges taxpayers to pay what they owe to avoid additional late-payment penalty and interest charges. the late-payment penalty, also known as the failure-to-pay penalty (ftp), is usually 0.5% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month the payment is late. interest, currently at the rate of 5 percent per year, compounded daily, also applies to any payment made after the original april 18 deadline.

after a return is filed, the irs will figure the penalty and interest due and bill the taxpayer. normally, the taxpayer will then have 21 days to pay any amount due.

"the loser's guide to getting over oc. ""i finally paid off $8 of credit card debt in 2 years while making $95k!""

""my grandfather, the ceo of a prestigious candy bar company, left me 250k after he died! should i visit all 490 countries or start a boutique pickle company?""

i'm exaggerating here, but growing up poor, some of the headlines on personalfinance have screamed ""first world problems!"" at times, and helped to reinforce the kind of uncertainty and anxiety i had as a poor. i couldn't help but think that being secure in my own life was a pipe dream.

as a foreword, i wanted to write to this post as a sort of tribute to r/pf (and r/frugal) because of all the invaluable information i've learned from it over the past few years, and how i've applied those lessons to my own life. but i also wanted to write this for those people who, like me, happened to be born poor, isolated, or desperate to escape your circumstances.

a bit about me: i was raised by a single mother in a working class neighborhood in a large american city. she, my sister, and i lived for many years on a meager social security check we received each month because my father died young, and my sister had down's syndrome. 

finances eased after my mom remarried (to a factory worker), until working class wages stalled in the late 90's and completely cratered around 2008. i received no financial education as a child--i had to google how to write a check at 22 because no one ever thought to tell me. i was also imbued with a healthy distrust of authority. 

like many of you, i was considered a child of promise. it was a foregone conclusion that i would attend college. i was the shining star of the neighborhood, after all, and it was a powerful statement that i was bettering myself. as a first generation college student, coming from a working class school, no one questioned my major (writing), or my school choice (a private art school). i was 17 years old, unwittingly signing up for $80,000 of student loans. 

i was academically prepared for college, sure, but socially i was completely out of my element. is this story starting to sound familiar? i know now that i'm not alone, not by a long shot. 

i didn't understand the value of making connections. i couldn't take that life changing internship because i worked part-time at my stepfather's factory. i graduated in 2011, right around the most stagnant labor market in 30 years. saddled with debt and uncertainty, i did what many do:

i didn't pay my loans, i wandered aimlessly, i battled anxiety like a full-time job. it wasn't until several years later, a move across the country (and back) that i started to get my life together. thanks, in no small part to this sub and others that stressed financial planning, accountability, and discipline.

but what nagged me was that while many people here posted about building something that lasts, i and millions of others were simply working towards that ever elusive 0: no debts, no masters. in fact, i still am. 

what follows is an incomplete list of things i've learned as someone born under the line, that they never taught us in school. that they never taught us at home. that i hope will help you 

1) **no one is coming** - it took a long time to let this one fully sink in. there will be no salvation. i don't mean this in a fatalistic way, just as a matter of fact. no one will pull you from poverty or desperation. those lottery numbers aren't coming in. your lady whose house you clean isn't leaving her money to you. the world is indifferent to your suffering. 

i found this freeing: it is solely up to you.

2) **adapt** outside of maybe 6 fields, most jobs and careers are teachable to anybody with an 8th grade education. in a sea of equally qualified candidates, you will only stand out as a personality fit. this was a hard pill to swallow as a young person. i lacked social skills, and leaned heavily on my immaculate resume. what an employer really wants is a ""3am guy."" someone who they don't want to murder on a late night, when the deadline's coming. someone they can depend on, joke with.  


put yourself out there

3) **you're not the only fuckup** i let my student loans default in my early 20's because i was literally too afraid to pick up the phone. when you're born poor, your standing is all you have, and the feeling of failure can be immense, unbearable. but you're not the only person struggling. these companies know the system is held afloat by a few top earners and the rest of us paying what we can when we can. make the call, get your shit straightened out. you'll find them willing to help 9 times out of 10.

4) **lie** i assume this will be the most controversial point. i have lied on every resume i've ever written. i've lied in every interview i've ever taken. you will not get ahead over someone who has the time and means to perfect themselves. it simply will not happen. lie, be charming, confident. lie like your livelihood depends on it. it does. but know that you are now accountable to your lies. be able to back them up with results. you will not get ahead by luck. the odds say you're not getting ahead at all. 

5) **you have more skills than you realize.** poor people have a fear of failure ingrained into their psyche because the stakes are real, and many become bitter of people for whom failure is just a minor setback. but failure, true failure, is the greatest learning experience in the world. no rich kid has ever had to come up with $200 by rent day, keep the lights on, find a way to get to work or, pay for a funeral on a line cook's wage. these are the skills to run a business, to run a family, to run your life. you are hungry, and you are sharp. no one can take that away from you. 

6) **don't become bitter.** this is the most important part. the world, despite how it sometimes feels, is amoral. love. grow. hope. but be prepared. 


i'd just like to thank the good contributors here over the years for all their help over the years. to all my fellow poors, you're not alone.

"my wife and i went over our budget yesterday and got a massive surprise.. we are getting ready to buy our first home so to ensure that we have plenty enough to cover any new furniture, repairs, closing costs or other expenses we decided to review our budget to cut back on anything extra. we took the time to centralize our contact information for paying bills and accounts for logins. while going over our insurance policy we realized our auto policy expired 3 months ago! without having reviewed our important documents and budget we could have missed this for who knows how long. reviewing our budget might just have saved us from a financial disaster.

"call discover unless you're comfortable with them selling your data. unfortunately many credit card companies and for-profit banks will merrily sell/share your personal data unless you opt-out, but the more responsible ones have at least added sections to their online account portal that tell you about it and make it easy to opt-out (chase is a rare positive-ish example). unfortunately discover buries that information in their privacy statement and makes you call 1-800-225-5202 to opt-out. they're clearly hoping people won't read the statement and won't opt-out, which is a sad and disappointingly anti-customer approach for them to take. aside from them, i definitely recommend checking the privacy policies for all of your financial institutions and finding out how to opt-out of data sharing if possible.",10
"do i have enough saved to adopt a cat?. hi r/personalfinance! i volunteer regularly at an animal shelter where i help socialize cats to prepare them for adoption. there is one that has kind of grabbed my heart and i am at least partially serious about adopting her. what is holding me back is the financial side of pet ownership. currently my only pets are some succulents /s

here is some of my basic info:

 - 22f

 - current full time college student, graduating in december with a bsn in nursing

 - current savings are a little over $1500

 - currently working a part time job as a home health caregiver, earning about $200-400 a month, but i could increase that potentially to $400-500 if i picked up more hours and watched less netflix. 

 - current monthly spending is usually $50-100 in miscellaneous things such as toiletries and meals with friends. i am relatively frugal!

initial fees for the cat would be a $40 adoption and a $400 deposit at my current apartment ($200 refundable on move out) plus food and litter supplies (estimating ? $120 right out, monthly will be less). i might be able to get the pet deposit waived by my mhnp that i see for anxiety and get the cat classified as an emotional support animal. the cat would already be spayed, with shots, and microchipped. my parents will be paying my rent and providing my food money until december, where i will move in with them while i study for my boards. when work starts (timeline estimates mid february) i will move in cities to live with my long term significant other. 

i'm a full time student, but i could definitely pick up more hours. i really haven't been saving for anything in particular other than my first month of rent/food for when i move to my new city (rent/bills will be ~$750). eventually i will need to get a new car, but that can definitely wait until my big girl money comes in.

my question is: do you think i can afford to adopt a cat? how much do you spend a month on your cat? is there a certain amount i should save first? 

i appreciate all advice! i also posted this on r/cats

"engineer about to be fired but given option to resign, should i take it?. not sure if this the correct sub for this but given the unemployment pay potential figured i'd give it a shot. 

little background i was planning on quitting this job in a few months to pursue my mba full time, however i was waiting for background checks to clear before quitting and also to save up a little more. i'm being fired due to not being able to perform the job as expected, not for misconduct or anything like that. i'm in texas and i've read i can still get unemployment even though i was fired. would it be smarter to get fired and receive unemployment until the fall? or to resign and be able to say i left on my own terms? 

*edit: wow this blew up thank you all for the advice! so to be a little clearer my job is an engineer by title but i don't really do engineering work and it's more a team operations type job that involves a ton of communication and leadership, areas i know i'm weak in but i hope an mba can help out with. i can't be too specific because it's a very niche job and high profile. however i have been given all the opportunity possible to improve but wasn't able to. 

after reading all these comments i'm leaning most towards being fired and receiving unemployment. my only real concern was background checks for school and other jobs showing that i was fired but my understanding is they won't and i can use going back to school as a reason why i was let go.  ",10
"parents want me to take out a loan/mortgage in my name towards new house. please advise.. this is a throwaway account, just in case, but i'm a 27 year old with pretty good credit (>750). i currently live at home and only make \~$40k a year. our family needs to move since the house we are in is too expensive for us to continue staying at, so we are trying to sell the house asap. once sold, my parent are trying to buy another smaller, cheaper house. the catch is, they want me to be on the mortgage. from what i understand, it seems that i'm to apply for the loan since my credit history is better, but my parents would be making the monthly payments and the down payment towards the house. i'm not sure if they can buy a house if it's not in my name. they also stated that before applying for a loan, they would pay off my student debt with the money they get from selling the house.

my parents want to be able to leave the house for me to live in after, but honestly, i don't plan on living with my family after 2 more years. my siblings will also (hopefully) be out of the house in 2 years due to potentially going to college.

i'm not really sure what i'm asking here, but any advice or input would be appreciated since i'm kind of at a loss for what to do. i do plan on sitting down and having a more detailed discussion with my parents since it seemed like they glossed over a ton of details, but if you have any suggestions as to what topics i should touch on, i'd greatly appreciate it.

thanks for reading.

**edit**: i've read through all the comments, and you guys have been really helpful. thanks for taking the time to write me a comment.

after doing some estimated head math, i think my parents *should* be fine on their own after selling the house/paying off old mortgage, but do you guys have resources to share to prep me better for all this house buying stuff? i want to have a better idea of how it all works, not just for myself, but maybe i'd be able to help my parents see if there are better options for them.",10
"450 reasons to check local classifies before buying new. today i bought a $500 dyson vacuum for $50. 

there is an ocean of perfectly good stuff for sale by individuals. generally, these people care more about getting rid of the stuff than how much money they make from the sale. furniture, small appliances, and (some) electronics are excellent items to buy second hand. people usually sell these items because either they upgraded or they're moving, so they're fairly motivated to sell. buying second hand not only stops the item from going into the landfill but also saves you a ton of money and/or allows you to afford nicer stuff. it's good for everyone except ""the man.""",10
"i laid off from my 99k job, my 8-month pregnant wife is still working making 90k (get 16wks paid leave), our emergency fund mostly drained from a prior emergency, and the day before i was laid off i signed up for a pmp course that will only give me a 75% refund; what next?. the debt we have is a few hundred on an amex bcp, about $6k on a 0% card with 20 months left, plus two car payments totaling about $700/mo. our mortgage is $1600/mo. i have an $804 child support payment. the pmp course was supposed to be reimbursed by my company and was $2,500 at a local university - the best i can get is $2000 back. it was charged to the 0% card. i'm a consultant/software developer, my wife is a construction manager. in addition to any other advice reddit has, and an aggressive job search, my question is: should i stay in the pmp course, or accept the $500 loss and cancel it?

*i -was- laid off. caffeine hasn't kicked in yet.

update: we were only making that much money for 19 months and 4 months in we were hit with a 35k lawsuit. prior to that, combined we made less than half of that. i was paying $600/mo in good faith, but when we moved the ex wanted more and sued. we mediated for $804/mo eventually, but not before she dragged everything out. i paid $4k in arrears. we also sunk a lot of money into house repairs.

update 2: i absolutely sincerely appreciate the advice and the sympathy. i also understand the rage: ""how you you be making this much money and be so <insert colorful words here>."" i really worked hard to get here, made a few mistakes and foolish choices, and had some bad luck. that's life - and i'm confident that i'll recover.

"bank of america - won't put more than $3k in fraudulent charges back in my account after three months. a warning to anyone thinking about using any bank of america services.

i finally had to file a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau, which oversees companies such as bank of america. i suggest you do the same if you're having problems with boa's customer non-service. https://www.consumerfinance.gov/

i'm also taking to social media (starting with bank of america's own facebook page as well as reddit and twitter) to voice my complaint.


i contacted bank of america on 7/2/2019 regarding several large charges that hit my checking account from a company called blueorange. the charges were for $1,899.99, 1,299.99, (both hit my account on 6/28/2019) 199.99 and 129.99 (both hit my account on 7/1). there were also several ""international translation fees"" that hit my account in the amount of $57, $39, $6 and $3.90.

this is a total of $3,635.86 stolen from my account. 

i called in to bank of america on 7/2 after discovering my account balance was off so much and discovering the charges. i was informed someone had my bank check/debit card information and that's where the charges were coming from. bank of america immediately closed my card and issued a new one and opened a dispute/claim on the charges from blueorange. for some reason they broke the charges into three separate claims, one for the $1,899.99 charge (claim #190628504171), one for the $1,299.99 charge (claim #190628504292), and one that combined the two charges for $199.99 and $129.99 (claim #190702508226).

since this was obviously a lot of money for me to be missing out of my account, i wanted to know when it would be returned to my account. i was told by the representative that she broke the charges into three claims to make it more likely that they would put the money back into my account while the claim was researched. then i was told the larger amounts wouldn't be put in my account, but the two smaller chargers would. this was very upsetting to me because it was the beginning of the month and i had bills to pay.

i also mentioned during the call that i had been a victim of identity theft where whoever had just about all my personal information imaginable filed a federal income tax return in my name for two consecutive years, applied for boat, car and payday loans, and even tried to open numerous checking accounts in my name. this was of little interest to the bank of america representative. 

i google searched this blueorange that hit me with all these charges, and found out it's a scam bank out of latvia that is notorious for not only scamming  people out of money but money laundering. 

on 7/9 i noticed in bank of america's online message center that the claims were resolved and would not be paid. i was very upset and called in to bank of america. i asked how this could be? i was told that bank of america claimed they contacted me and that i approved the charges in question, which was ludicrous. i said so to the representative. at first i was told i received a call, which i didn't. then i was told i didn't receive a call but i received a text approving the charges. i told them this was just not correct, that they kept changing their story and it seemed like they just didn't want to reimburse my account for these fraudulent charges.

the bank of america representative said he would note the account that i wasn't contacted nor did i approve these charges and the claims would be reopened and escalated for a quick resolution.

i also went into my local branch in mid-july to speak to a manager and let her know everything that happened up to that point and she did absolutely nothing. it was a waste of an hour with her on hold calling the same fraud department regurgitating the same story they had already given me. 

i called into bank of america's fraud department several times between mid-july and mid-september for an update wondering why it was taking so long for this to be resolved and the money to be put back in my account. each time i was told it could take until the last week of september or so based on the 45 days, or 60 days (i was told both) it can take to resolve fraudulent charge claims.

finally on 9/25/19 i still hadn't heard anything from bank of america. i called in and was told that they were past the 45 days it should have taken and the person i spoke to was going to make sure there was a resolution in the next day or two.

i logged in on 9/26/19 and once again all three claims said ""resolved"" and ""unable to pay.""

i was very upset.


it appears bank of america didn't even do any real research like this because when i called in to bank of america's fraud department on 9/27/19 to find out why they didn't pay these fraudulent claims on my account, i spoke with susie in arkansas and she once again told me all the notes said is that bank of america claims to have contacted me on 6/27/19 and that i validated the charges, which is crazy. i looked back on my history and i see no calls, no messages or anything from bank of america on 6/27.

i let susie know all that had transpired and she was shocked that bank of america had, and i quote (i also have a recording of this call) ""had not been an advocate for its customer but instead had been more of an adversary."" susie seemed genuinely concerned (the first person at bank of america i had talked to that actually did seem concerned about what happened to me) and said ""it seems to me like someone here just swept this under the rug and didn't want to deal with it."" she also saw the same thing i did about this blueorange apparently being some kind of foreign scam bank or company. i also requested documentation of the research bank of america actually did on these claims be sent to me.

susie wrote everything we talked about as well as her opinions on how i (as a customer) as well as the disputes/claims had been treated so far during this nightmare and reopened the claims. she wrote down what we had talked about and entered them in the claim notes and said she was sending this to an upper manager who should read it on 9/30/19 or 10/1/19. i also let her know i would probably be filing a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau because i see no other recourse at this time.

i would like this resolved and the funds that were fraudulently taken from my account put back immediately.

i believe this entire situation reflects very poorly on bank of america and how it treats its customers. i also wanted to warn anyone thinking of banking at bank of america to think twice about that decision.",10

"mom gave vague credit info to a company who offered to pay off balance. they paid it off and 12 days later it's still $0. scam?. all she told them was the balance amount, who the card was with, her first name only and the expiration date of the card. absolutely nothing else. i kept telling her not to do it because they contacted her through instagram, the numero uno of red flags. 

she did it anyways and they paid off $1200 in cc debt. i'm almost sure it's money laundering or something but it's been 12 full days since they've paid it and it's still showing as zero balance and the credit card company said the payment has completely cleared.

they gave her their account information to make the payment.

update: convinced my mom to report the card stolen and freeze the account. she took screenshots of their entire conversations and they had a website set up to convince her. they have a website (http://burdenfreefinancial.simdif.com) they used to convince her to do a ""cash flip."" 

i'm just annoyed that she didn't see this was a scam clear as day in the first place. she even gave them my information and sent me their banking info.

update 2: okay... she refuses to change her passwords. she won't request a new card. she now tells me that they asked her to send them $200 and they will pay off her 10k credit card. and she's going to do it. 😐

she seriously thinks she's outwitted them because she withdrew the $200 and deposited it into a separate account and only would pay them via paypal instead of direct wire.

she keeps saying how their website is so nice and that's what nonprofits do, help people. a website full of typos and ugliness...

washington — the internal revenue service today announced cost of living adjustments affecting dollar limitations for pension plans and other retirement-related items for tax year 2019.  the irs today issued technical guidance detailing these items in notice 2018-83(http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&enid=zwfzptembwfpbgluz2lkptiwmtgxmtaxljk3mdi5njcxjm1lc3nhz2vpzd1nreitufjelujvtc0ymde4mtewms45nzayoty3mszkyxrhymfzzwlkptewmdemc2vyawfspte3mje0nji1jmvtywlsawq9zgf2awracnjtb2f0c2nwys5jb20mdxnlcmlkpwrhdmlkqhjybw9hdhnjcgeuy29tjmzspszlehryyt1ndwx0axzhcmlhdgvjzd0mjiy=&&&127&&&https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-18-83.pdf).

&#x200b;

**highlights of changes for 2019**

the contribution limit for employees who participate in 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans, and the federal government's thrift savings plan is increased from $18,500 to $19,000.

the limit on annual contributions to an ira, which last increased in 2013, is increased from $5,500 to $6,000. the additional catch-up contribution limit for individuals aged 50 and over is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $1,000.

the income ranges for determining eligibility to make deductible contributions to traditional individual retirement arrangements (iras), to contribute to roth iras and to claim the saver's credit all increased for 2019.

taxpayers can deduct contributions to a traditional ira if they meet certain conditions. if during the year either the taxpayer or their spouse was covered by a retirement plan at work, the deduction may be reduced, or phased out, until it is eliminated, depending on filing status and income. (if neither the taxpayer nor their spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work, the phase-outs of the deduction do not apply.) here are the phase-out ranges for 2019:

* for single taxpayers covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $64,000 to $74,000, up from $63,000 to $73,000.
* for married couples filing jointly, where the spouse making the ira contribution is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $103,000 to $123,000, up from $101,000 to $121,000.
* for an ira contributor who is not covered by a workplace retirement plan and is married to someone who is covered, the deduction is phased out if the couple's income is between $193,000 and $203,000, up from $189,000 and $199,000.
* for a married individual filing a separate return who is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.

the income phase-out range for taxpayers making contributions to a roth ira is $122,000 to $137,000 for singles and heads of household, up from $120,000 to $135,000. for married couples filing jointly, the income phase-out range is $193,000 to $203,000, up from $189,000 to $199,000. the phase-out range for a married individual filing a separate return who makes contributions to a roth ira is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.

the income limit for the saver's credit (also known as the retirement savings contributions credit) for low- and moderate-income workers is $64,000 for married couples filing jointly, up from $63,000; $48,000 for heads of household, up from $47,250; and $32,000 for singles and married individuals filing separately, up from $31,500.

&#x200b;

**highlights of limitations that remain unchanged from 2018**

the catch-up contribution limit for employees aged 50 and over who participate in 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans and the federal government's thrift savings plan remains unchanged at $6,000.

&#x200b;

edit:

the limitation for defined contribution plans under section 415(c)(1)(a) is increased in 2019 from $55,000 to $56,000. (ie mega backdoor roth contribution)

the limitation under § 408(p)(2)(e) regarding simple retirement accounts is increased from $12,500 to $13,000.",10
"eating out kills. i am a 22m and have just realized how badly i've been screwing myself eating out every day b/l/d

i've know for awhile now that i'd be much better off cooking at home but hadn't ever really bothered to figure out how much it was costing me. i now realize that i spend more on food a month than i do on rent and i've now racked up $2200 in credit card debt that's just added up a little bit at a time. i used to spend a check on rent and a check paying off the card but my habit has gotten to the point where a paycheck no longer covers it.

i've always known eating out was killing me physically. now that i know that it's killing me fiscally its been eating at my mind killing me mentally.

i'm at a loss on what to do to kill this habit and stop spending money. i need to get rid of that debt before something bad happens.

i've gotten a ton of really good recommendations from you all and i genuinely appreciate the support, kind words, and advise given. 

i've installed mint and have set a budget for $100 for eating out for the month.

* x1 box of raisin bran crunch
* x1 carton of eggs
* x1 package of cheese sticks
* x1 5 piece package of chicken breasts
* x5 packages of various veggies
* x2 packages of salad mix

"personal finance ""loopholes"", updated. a lot of personal finance advice is straightforward applications of math: keep expenses less than income.  pay off highest interest rate debts first.  compound growth is your friend.

then there are obvious legal requirements and benefits:   use tax-preferred retirement / hsa accounts.  keep insurance in force.   know how self-employment taxes work. 

this post is about less-obvious ways to use ""loopholes"" / little-known benefits in existing us laws to your advantage.   (our friends in other countries are welcome to lobby for local versions *in their associated personal finance subs*.)

here are some that you may not already know about:

taxes / tax planning:

- take advantage of ""adjustments(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/cut-your-taxes-without-itemizing-1.aspx)"" like ira/hsa contributions,  student loan interest, tuition, moving costs, self-employment taxes/healh insurance paid,etc., to reduce taxable income if you are eligible.  you can take these even if you do not otherwise itemize.

- if you are not a full-time student and earn less than 30k single / 60k jointly, you can use the saver's credit(https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit) to get a tax credit (better than a deduction!) for a portion of your ira or 401k contributions, even for roth contributions.  you can even deduct a contribution to get your income to qualify.  

- gifts and inheritances are generally not taxable to the recipient.  other untaxed ""income"" includes most insurance payouts and damage awards; child support; some scholarships; rebates and loyalty program bonuses.  remember that loans are not income, though forgiven loans typically are.  

- you pay no taxes at all on long-term capital gains(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/no-capital-gains-due-for-some-investors-1.aspx) if your taxable income (including those gains) is less than the top of the 15% tax bracket.  that could be $95,000 gross income for a married couple filing jointly.  you can can do this at any age.

- sales of a personal residence often have no capital gains tax(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/capital-gains-and-your-home-sale-1.aspx) as well.  you have to have lived in the house as your primary residence two of the past five years; you get $250,000 per sale ($500,000 for a couple).   

- if you rent a room in your house, part of all of your housing expenses (including insurance and utilities) can be schedule e expense deductions against your rental income(http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-out-room-your-house.html) (but you need to declare the rental income.)  you don't have taxable income / deductions if your roommates who share the lease give you money to send to your  landlord.  

- if you received a 1099 reporting income that wasn't really yours , e.g. for selling something on behalf of someone else, use a nominee distribution(http://www.arahcpa.com/blog/don8217t-forget-those-nominee-1099s/36087) declaration to avoid being taxed on it.

- if your spouse owes money to the federal government, use an injured spouse(https://www.irs.gov/irm/part25/irm_25-018-005.html) form to keep the irs from withholding your share of a joint tax refund.  this is different than an innocent spouse(https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc205.html) situation, where your spouse tried to evade taxes without your knowledge.

retirement:

- think you make too much to contribute to roth ira?  think again!  the backdoor roth ira(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/backdoor-roth-ira-high-income-how-to-guide/) may work for you.  there's even a mega-backdoor roth(http://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/) for high-income people with certain 401k plans.

- employer contributions to your 401k don't count(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/retirement/employer-match-counts-toward-401k-limit.aspx) against the 18k limit.  

- if you change you mind about making an ira contribution, e.g. your income becomes too high for it to be deductible, you can simply remove the money(https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/excess-contribution) before the tax filing deadline without penalty.

- self-employed people have lots of options(https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people) for retirement accounts, including a solo-401k and a sep ira.  this can apply even if you have employment retirement savings.

health insurance:

- if you change jobs and don't have insurance coverage for a time, you have 60 days to elect continuing (cobra) coverage, during which time you are eligible to be covered even if you haven't and won't pay for it.  this works retroactively(http://www.mymoneyblog.com/cobra-and-retroactive-health-insurance-coverage.html); you can decide to take cobra at day 59 if you do have major expenses, pay for it, and be covered for the previous 59 days.  

- you won't pay a penalty for lack of health insurance if you have a single  brief coverage gap(http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-coverage-gap-exemption/), which is defined as ""less than three months.""  i.e. may 3 to july 31 is ok.  may 1 to july 31 is not.

"i work at a skilled nursing facility. if you know someone on medicare, please read.. please read this if you have a friend or family member that it medicare eligible. it could save them from paying a bill they do not owe. 
i spent the day at an educational seminar on medicare billing. 
on october 1st of this year (2 weeks from now), medicare will be drastically changing the way they pay bills for medicare services, and this includes medicare advantage plans. 

the seminar i attended was for skilled nursing rehabilitation services (i.e. inpatient therapy for a broken hip). 

as with anything medicare rolls out, it is convoluted, redundant and nonsensical. most facilities have done little training (or as much as they could), ours was today, and we have to start documenting on it next week. 
the charting on skilled nursing patients has to be on point, and in many cases, if nursing and therapy services don't document properly, even something minor can trigger a rejection. 

it is the majority of facilities standard practice, or sometimes even an automated one, to issue a bill as soon as insurance or medicare issues a denial. this means your family member could possibly receive a bill because of an error on the facility's part, or on medicare's part. 

most places will try and correct the issue and resubmit, and that will generally fix the problem. 

however, there are two issues:
one, if the process is automated, it may take them several days to find the issue (as i said, the process is new and convoluted), then several days for the billing department to resubmit, then several more days for medicare to approve, if they choose not to audit the charges, if they do, it could be longer. 

this leads to the second problem. 
my grandparents do not generally let bills sit around for long. even if they do not pay the whole amount, they pay something. if medicare eventually pays the claim, any payment they put toward the bill will now have to be refunded by the facility. they would have to wait for the medicare statement to prove the claim was paid, then go through the refund process with the facility billing office. most facilities are not locally owned, so this would likely have to be done through email or over the phone. 

our grandparents are in their late eighties and are on a fixed income. if they even realized they overpaid a bill, they would have no idea where to begin to start the refund process. they would likely chalk it up to a loss, but for some, the money they lose could mean groceries for a week. 

the process will eventually even out and become our routine, but it could take several months. please speak to your friends and family who receive medicare/have a medicare advantage plan. let them know to put medical bills aside for you to review before they pay, and to let you know if they receive any medicare denial notifications. ask them to put them aside so you can review them, and before anything is paid, if something stands out, call the medicare/insurance office, facility or hospital and verify what was paid and what was not, and if something wasn't paid, ask of the appeal process was initiated by the facility. 

i know my facility, and most others, are educating the billing, administration, therapy and nursing staff as much as they can to make sure issues are kept at a minimum. 
let's be honest, though, it's a new system. the rollout is going across the entire united states, all at once. somewhere, someone has no idea what they're doing. somewhere, someone is going to go to work on october 1st, not having any idea what they're supposed to do. somewhere, someone is going to screw up royally and cause a whole lot of people a whole lot of headaches. 

also, if you know a mds nurse, give them a hug on october 2nd. if you have some wine available, and some tissues, they probably won't mind that, either.",10

"it's been 7 years now, and i want to share my story with bank of america. first off, if you're lending an ear (or an eye) i want to sincerely thank you. i've told this story so many times when asked about the last 7 years of my life; anything that has had to do with school, loans for school and building my credit/savings. 

april 2009 i started a job at a local chili's bar and grill as a busser. i was 17 years old it was just a side job on the weekends during high school. i was making $2.13/h with added 'tips' from the waiters and waitresses. 

a big thing my dad has always preached to me was to save money, so i decided to open a bank account with bank of america solely because the check that i received from my job came from that bank. 

i remember, very clearly, being brought into an office to set up a 'student' account with them. the representative made sure to explain all the benefits of the account being that i was a student. however, the ironic part about the whole experience was her putting an emphasis on overdraft protection that came with the account, to protect students from incurring fees that they could not afford.  fair enough. that sold me. it seemed as though it was a solid decision at the time so i went through with it. 

about a week in, i used the debit card that came with the checking account i set up to buy something on the net. i can't remember exactly what it was buy i do remember this company double charging me and... low and behold... over-drafting my account by 5 dollars. 

i was only my making so much while working at this job, and it had been apparent to me, at the time, that i was either lied to by this bank representative about 'overdraft protection' or something fell through the cracks. i didn't want any more trouble so i decided to pay the overdraft fee and then close the account. 


then something horrid happens that effects the next 5-6 years of my life, and this is mainly what i'm posting here for:

**as it turns out boa had placed something of a 'credit' lock on my social security**

- preventing me from taking out loans for myself to go to school when it was time.

- opening up any bank accounts at any bank in the country.

- opening any credit cards to establish and grow my credit.

- flagged me as an identity thief on my own name.

besides the slimy legal crap, it looks like i have to go through, i'm here posting this because i'd like to know how do i get out of this rut boa has put my in. i was able to attend school for two years because my grandfather cosigned for me for two years.. but his passing has forced me to leave school and attend community college where i can only go if i pay out of pocket. 

for years i've been working and trying my best to pay these loans, all while putting food in my mouth.. paying my parents (who i live with) rent, and living expenses. but i can only do so much with the 9-10 dollar an hour jobs and i don't know what to do any more.

**tl;dr: bank of america places a sketchy 'ban' on my credit because i closed my bank account after a over-drafting and it has crippled my finances so much, i couldn't finish school and i'm struggling to get by among other things.**

any help is greatly appreciated... thank you!!

**edit** a big thanks to /u/amara313 for posting information about something called chexsystems(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/blacklisted-by-chexsystems-what-to-know/). this is the exact same thing that has happened and plagued me for the last 7 years of my life. 

i hope this serves as some help by some bizarre consequence it happens to you too!

**edit2/update** i wanted to make this in response to all the support and added discussion. i did not expect this post to gain all the traction that it did. some of you even messaged me personally. i seriously could not be more thankful of all of you chiming in. it means a lot and makes me love this site even more. i have to go to the proper steps to reactivate my case against boa. not officially, but it was only up until today i had some time of substantial update to my dilemma. like, i have actual answers to some things. that's so relieving, so i will pursue this. i will update this post with substantial updates so that it may actually serve as help to people who have had similar problems and didn't know how to go about fixing it.",10
"if you already have financing lined up for a car, don't give the car dealership your social security number.. car dealerships are often very sleazy. one of the tricks that's been attempted on me and relatives is the dealership stating that they need your social security number to complete a sale if you have your own financing.

this is not true. the irs rules on transactions over 10k are for *cash* transactions not bank checks. they are trying to get your social security number to run a credit report on you so that they can come back and try to talk you out of your own financing. this credit pull has the potential to lower your credit score *depending on your circumstances*.

i buy used, my cu has better rates than dealerships plus i'd rather deal with my cu over whatever financing the dealership has. just wanted to give everyone a heads up because it's something to be added to the long list of things to look out for when buying a car.

edit: where are people possibly getting that i'm saying a cu will always beat a dealership? i said *my* cu can beat the dealership. additionally for the 100th time in the thread you do not need a ssn for ofac. edit3: thanks to /u/helper543 for pointing out this ofac scam last month. (https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7e9rgw/when_buy_a_car_beware_of_the_deal_tricking_you/)

the fact that so many self described car salesman say you do shows just how pervasive the training they get to garner your ssn. there are apparently some states that require a ssn for titling but those are the minority of states, most only require a drivers license.

edit2: for the people saying ""the dealership would never run your credit without your explicit permission"" please read the dozens of replies where other people have said this happened to them. advocating being cavalier with your ssn is terrible advice. beyond negative effects on credit (which i admit may only happen in certain circumstances) giving your ssn out to people that do not legally need it is terrible advice.",10
"if you haven't filed your us federal tax return yet because you owe and can't pay, file it by june 14 to avoid the higher late-filing penalty.. taxpayers who owe tax and file their federal income tax return more than 60 days after the deadline will generally face a higher late-filing penalty. ordinarily, the late-filing penalty, also known as the failure-to-file penalty (ftf), is assessed when a taxpayer fails to file a tax return or request an extension by the return due date. this penalty, which only applies if there is unpaid tax, is usually 5 percent for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late.

if a tax return is filed more than 60 days after the april due date -- or more than 60 days after the october due date if an extension was obtained -- the minimum penalty is either $210 or 100 percent of the unpaid tax, whichever is less. this means that if the tax due is $210 or less, the penalty is equal to the tax amount due. if the tax due is more than $210, the penalty is at least $210. the late-filing penalty will stop accruing once the taxpayer files a complete and correct return.

the ftf penalty does not apply to the taxpayers who met this year's april 15 deadline to file their individual tax return. it also won't apply to the taxpayers who asked the irs for a six-month extension of time to file, as long as they file by oct. 15, 2019.

in addition, the irs urges taxpayers to pay what they owe to avoid additional late-payment penalty and interest charges. the late-payment penalty, also known as the failure-to-pay penalty (ftp), is usually 0.5% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month the payment is late. interest, currently at the rate of 5 percent per year, compounded daily, also applies to any payment made after the original april 15 deadline.

after a return is filed, the irs will figure the penalty and interest due and bill the taxpayer. normally, the taxpayer will then have 21 days to pay any amount due.

if you are *claiming a refund* on your federal return and filing late, there is generally no penalty or interest charge.

"the non-panicked layoff. two weeks ago life was simple. i could go to the grocery store and pick out whatever i wanted without looking at the price tag. i could peruse a department store for new heels that matched my new dress guilt free. i could even cover a large and unexpected card repair without a single negative emotion entering the equation. i was making plenty of money for a young single adult to live on, and i was comfortable and carefree. 

and then i wasn't. all it took was one email with one simple message, ""you are being laid off"" to cause my heart to feel like it dropped through my feet and my brain to run amok with the thought of  ""oh sh*t."" but the panic was brief, and thanks to a number of years on this sub (obviously not on this throwaway account ) i was well prepared for the moment.

the first thing i did was to check my financial status and was thrilled to find that by having money get auto deducted from my paid check for an emergency fund, i had managed to save over 6 months of expenses in just a few years! it also helped that i spent my late teens/early 20s on this site and learned to keep lifestyle inflation in check while my income grew.

the second thing i did was file for unemployment. i was getting no severance and was not owed any vacation. this sub convinced me that taking unemployment was not something to be ashamed of. i earned it. 

the third thing i did was apply to jobs. i am still on this third step, but am happy to report that i am nearly as comfortable and carefree as i was two weeks ago. i know i have the means to support myself for quite some time and can take the time to apply to cool sounding jobs, take hikes in the mountains (the trees are so colorful this time of year!) and enjoy a nice respite from the 9-5 grind. 

so, thank you. your discussions, questions, and advice on this sub over the past few years led me to having financial security when i needed it the most.

"a raise is still a raise regardless of if you cross a tax bracket.. in a state government job, and we all just got a raise.  for many in my department, that crossed them into a higher federal bracket.  so naturally i heard people agonizing over how it is a ""fake raise"" 

i had to explain how it is still a raise. and explain that you aren't taxed 22% on all 40k, you are taxed at 10% for the first 10k, and then 22% for the next 20k, making an over all tax rate of ~13%.

i also had to explain that all the 401k and pension withholdings also go up with that raise.  

so i wanted to take a moment to remind you all that a raise is still a raise in compensation regardless of if you cross in to a new tax bracket. i'm sure there might be exceptions, but not for the average person.",10
"2.5k taken from boa checking account at an atm in a distant state. they had pin. filed claim and lost.. the day before the charges appeared i used my debit card since i didnt have my cc on me.  i rarely use my debit card.  it wasnt at a sketchy place (it was at trader joes.  i did debit+pin which i now realize is a mistake) but the timing is really suspicious. i have no proof that this was where it was compromised though, but i hadnt used the card in 1 month at least.

i dont know what to do.  i remember when i called my bank the guy on the line said he never sees people win claims when the thieves have the pin.  the implication was that the pin is 100% not hackable so any breach is my fault.  he asked me if i had it written on the card, etc.

boa investigated and concluded ""no error"" and ""the claim was authorized"".

i called citibank, whose atm was used for the fraud.  they couldnt tell me anything at all, since i do not have an account with them. 

also, i filed a police report in my jurisdiction, not where it happened

what blows my mind is that this is a digital transaction in the age of infinite data.  i have the time to the second and and the atm at which it happened.  and no one can tell me the account to which it went.

either bank basically said to contact the other one.

edit: it was not a cash withdrawal.  someone paid their cc with a spoof of my debit card at an atm. (the transaction said citibank- credit card payment) thats why i cant believe they cant reverse the transaction.

also, i called the bank the day it showed up, due to a mint alert.  they told me it was pending and i had to let it go through and then file a claim.  i did that.",10
"cut cell phone expense from $225/month to $90/month by switching to prepaid. i'll admit it. i've always been a phone snob. i had to have the next newest iphone every time one came out. i've also always been a service snob. if i didn't have the name brand service it wasn't good enough. 

well, that all changed. my wife and i have started budgeting and trying to cut costs in places to start saving more and increase expendable income. this was a great place to start. we had the available funds to buy out our phones and have them carrier unlocked. once that was done we switched to cricket wireless. i can't speak for everyone but our service is better now.

"i was billed $432 for a 10-minute doctor visit. no tests were done and the office refuses to give me more information about the charges.. the invoice just shows up as ""office visit"". i called the billing number on the invoice to ask about it, and they told me to call the doctor's office. i called the doctor's office, and they told me to call my insurance company. i called my insurance company, and they told me to call the doctor's office.


the second time i called the doctor's office, they told me that there was a ""new patient charge"" that was ""significant"", but they would not tell me how much those charges were. they also said that i was billed for 4 different things, but would not give me any details about what those things are.


it seems suspicious that they won't give me any information. i also think this ""significant new patient cost"" is suspicious - i have never heard of this before. if i was charged for 4 different things, shouldn't they appear on the invoice?

"when does it make sense to stop repairing a car?. i drive a 2011 vw jetta with 70k miles on it that just developed a critical issue, turning the engine into a ticking time-bomb until i pay a mechanic to pull it out and replace a flawed piece related to the timing chain. apparently there was already a class action lawsuit against vw for the same issue, but it was for a different engine so i'm not covered. the repair would cost 2-4 grand, whereas the car's kbb is no more than 5k.

my mother's trying to convince me to buy a new car, citing the ""if repairs cost more than the car, get a new one"" rule, and ""many"" of her friends' anecdotal experiences about encountering more problems once a repair of this scale is completed.

"are ""no haggle"" car dealerships the new norm?. interested in hearing other's experiences. i just bought a used vehicle at a large ford dealership yesterday. my father bought a used car at a toyota dealership recently, and had the same experience.

despite my best efforts, they would not budge on the vehicle price. the salesman kept referencing ""internet pricing"", saying it's already listed at their best price. now, the price had dropped by $1,000 from when i  first saw it last week, but they would not move from that price yesterday. he said the dealership is part of a no-haggle network of dealerships, though it isn't advertised as such.  it's been 10 years since i bought a car, so maybe the landscape is changing, but to me, everything is negotiable. i was able to negotiate on my trade-in, and get a deal i was happy with, but i was genuinely surprised they wouldn't budge on the vehicle price.

is ""no haggle"" or ""internet price"" just the way dealerships do business now?

edit to add: 

lots of good posts here, seems like there isn't much haggling in the used car industry anymore. to add some clarity, i had been searching for months, waiting for the right deal for the vehicle i wanted. my out the door price was below the kbb, the dealer is also going to buff out some minor scratches, and they filled the tank (30 gallons).  i still got a good deal, i was just surprised that they wouldn't go any lower on the price. in my past experience, there was always room to go down a little bit.",10
"my dad died and left me a fancy condo with no mortgage. and yet, i can't really afford to live here!. my dad passed away and i inherited his fancy 3 bedroom condo with no mortgage that's worth somewhere around $500-600k. he lived just outside a large city in the midwest but i was wanting to move there anyway. so moving in the condo seems like a great idea. but then i find out the taxes are more than $12k per year. the hoa ( assessments) is like $800 per month. that's basically $1800 per month for a fancy condo that's actually larger than i even need. what i actually \*need\* is a smaller apartment... that rents for about $1800 per month. i don't have a steady income right now, so it would seem like i should just sell and use that money to help with rent. the problem is the real estate market is soft right now, and properties aren't selling quickly, and even worse, they don't increase in value the way they do in la or ny. it's basically gone up $50-100k since it was first purchased in 2003 -- and this is a great, gentrified area.

so my question is actually as follows. if renting costs me $1800 per month and owning costs me $1800 per month, is there really any larger benefits to owning in a city where the housing is fairly stagnant?

**edit:** when i mention the option of renting an $1800 apartment, i'm just guessing the cost of a decent one bedroom apartment in this area. it might be a bit less. i might find something great for $1300 but that's probably the bottom and it would be a lucky find.",10

"it's the end of the year, time to remember those credit cards you have in a drawer!. i make this post once a year, around the christmas/new year's eve time.

as most of us know, keeping your credit history as long as possible is very good for our credit scores. the more lines of credit we have open, the more it affects our average age of credit, total amount of credit available, and just in general credit score goodness. 

that being said, it's time to think of the credit lines we have open just to keep the average age of credit up. those cards that you have stuck in a drawer because they have no annual fee, but don't give decent enough rewards to be used on a regular basis.

it's that time now! pull those cards out and buy a value meal at a mcdonalds. maybe a coffee at starbucks. hell, use them to buy a tank of gas for your car. 

if you have enough monthly charges, put each card with one of them. insurance on one, netflix on another, etc. then set up auto-payment so you don't need to even think about them.

the important cards are the ones that may get canceled because of non-usage. those are the ones that you want to do anything with this year. spend something on them, then immediately go pay them off. just like always, you don't need to pay interest to keep your credit score up.

"always pay for a sewer scope as part of the inspection process when buying a house, doing this saved us $18,000!. we are closing on a big 1953 rancher tomorrow, and as part of our inspection process we hired a plumbing company to do a scope of the sewer line (putting a camera down to see the condition of the line, if there are any tree roots, etc in there). my wife is a realtor so she's seen a few instances of people having major issues with their sewer lines after buying a house, and wanted to be sure we avoided it.

""do you want your life to get better, worse, or stay the same?""

i get home and log into ebay and see that these $50,000 memberships can be bought for literally $1. 

the whole experience was horrifying. they prey on the uneducated and those with special needs. 

edit: someone checked my math on the interest. i way overestimated. 

edit 2: i'm so happy that this post blew up on /r/personalfinance. we went to dinner theater and my 7 year old niece had an incredible time and it made the bullshit 100% worth it. honestly though, i should have just bought my tickets. the 2 hours promised turned into 4 hours. i was belittled, shamed, and insulted.

as some have pointed out there are **rare** situations where timeshares are worth it, especially if the maintenance fees are fixed. for the most part, it's $50k-100k of revenue for the hotel groups that is pure profit. if you are stuck in a timeshare you hate getout! if you aren't, count your blessings and *gasp* rent your hotel rooms, use your credit card rewards, or use airbnb.

"a guide to efficient banking. **tl;dr** \- checking accounts are over-used. you should keep most of your money in a high-yield savings account and use credit cards for all of your purchases. the credit cards should autopay from your savings account. checking accounts should only store money you might need for immediate transfers, such as atm withdraws or paypal/venmo.

# a guide to efficient banking

**""efficiency is intelligent laziness""**

i'm a very lazy person. however - i've found a system for my finances that works well for me. it's easy to manage, and i believe it to be a significant improvement over ""typical"" banking.

when i say **typical banking**, this is what i mean:

* checking accounts: used for money you plan on spending (bills, food, gas, etc.)
* savings account: used for money you don't plan on spending anytime soon (emergencies, retirement)
* credit card account: used for purchases you can't afford but have to make - avoid if possible (hospital bills, car repairs)

if you agree with any of those 3 statements, you may benefit from this post. if you'd like to skip the storytelling, scroll down to the ""efficient setup"" section.

**""are we doing this because it's right, or because it's the way it's always been done?""**

this is one of my favorite questions to ask during meetings at work, and i recently found myself asking the same question about my bank accounts. in order to accurately answer this question, i decided to analyze the different types of accounts and track my thoughts.

**breakdown: checking account**

there is no limit on monthly transactions. money used in purchases immediately leaves your account. atms allow you to withdraw cash. account balance typically accrues little to no interest.

* a checking account is like a 'digital wallet'. it's almost identical to carrying around cash. i can't spend cash i don't have - cash leaves my wallet as soon as i spend it - i don't earn cash by leaving it in my wallet.

**breakdown: savings account**

there is a limit of 6 monthly transactions. money used in purchases immediately leaves your account. account balance can accrue higher amounts of interest.

* woah - the interest rates on these accounts are nice. if i had a debit card for a savings account, and if it weren't for the monthly transaction limit, i wouldn't even need a checking account.

**breakdown: credit card account**

there is no limit on monthly transactions, but there is a limit on monthly spending. money used in purchases stays in your account until the credit card payment is made. rather than gaining interest, you risk being charged interest if you don't pay the full statement balance. if you can't make the minimum payment, there are other fees as well. to motivate usage, many credit cards have a ""rewards"" program for points or cash back. some credit cards also have signing bonuses - such as a period of low interest or an 'initial spending' reward. like most ""bills"", allows for automatic payments. proper usage builds credit history, which may help in future financial situations.

* being charged fees for missed payments is scary, but if i set up automatic payments than i should be fine. i don't want to be charged interest either, so i definitely don't want to make any purchases i can't afford paying off immediately. the signing bonuses and rewards are enticing though, and i want to improve my credit score.

**breakdown: conclusion**

after breaking everything down - i started trying to piece it back together. the ""typical banking"" routine didn't hold up. rather than only keeping a subset of funds in a savings account and avoiding credit cards, it would be much better to only keep a subset of funds in a checking account and utilize credit cards for all purchases. this would maximize cash back rewards and maximize interest earned on money. not only that - since a credit card transaction doesn't immediately remove the money from your account, the money will accrue interest in the savings account for longer.

# the ""efficient"" setup

* checking account: used for money you may need to use immediately. for example, atm withdraws and paypal/venmo transfers. i almost never have these types of transactions, so i keep about $150 in my checking account.
* savings account: used for all money that isn't in the checking account. use for automatic payments to your credit cards, adding more funds to your checking account, and transactions that can't go on the credit card (maybe rent, car payment, credit cards)
   * you can open multiple savings accounts if it helps you track specific savings goals, or if you need more than 6 monthly transactions you can't make on a credit card.
   * if you aren't lazy, you might want to take a portion of this money and do other fancy finance things instead of letting it stay in a high-yield savings account
* credit card accounts: used for as many transactions as possible to maximize cash back/rewards. you only need 1 card for this setup to work, but you might benefit from having multiple cards.

**specific setup**

checking account: i use charles schwab for my checking account. it's an online bank with no monthly fees, unlimited atm rebates, and 0.40% apy interest. i never really deal with cash, so i am fine with an online bank. this bank plays well into my expected usage of the account.

* read more: https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking\_lending/checking\_account(https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account)
* note: if you can get a referral code, schwab will give you $100 after 1 month of having your account open.

savings account: i use ally for my savings account. it's also an online bank with no monthly fees. it currently offers 2.18% interest, compounded daily, which is estimated to be a 2.20% annual percentage yield.

* link:  https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/(https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/) 

credit cards: i use 3 different credit cards. you should find the right credit card(s) for you, but here is what worked for me:

* citi double cash
   * this card gets 2% cash back on all purchases. i use this card for monthly bills (power, internet, phone) and any purchase i don't use another card for. if you only wanted to use 1 credit card - this would be my recommendation.
   * read more:  https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?id=citi-double-cash-credit-card(https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?id=citi-double-cash-credit-card) 
* barclays uber
   * i use this for 4% on dining and 3% on hotels/airfare. it also has a signing bonus - spend $500 in the first 90 days for $100 cash back. if you're planning on applying for multiple cards - apply for this one first. barclays is picky. i have a good credit score, but i was still denied. i called their reconsideration line and was approved after a 2 minute phone call.
   * read more:  https://cards.barclaycardus.com/banking/cards/uber-visa-card/(https://cards.barclaycardus.com/banking/cards/uber-visa-card/) 
* capitalone savorone
   * i use this for 3% on entertainment and 2% on grocery. it also has 2 signing bonuses. first, spend $500 in the first 90 days for $150 cash back. second, 0% apy for the first 15 months. i'm ""budgeting"" the full statement balance on this card, but only making minimum payments during the 0% apy period. if i had outstanding credit debt, i would have done a balance transfer to this card (3% fee) and then paid off as much as possible when the 0% apy period ended.
   * link:  https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savorone-dining-rewards/(https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savorone-dining-rewards/) 

i've been operating like this for a couple of months now. i had to do some work up front, to open the accounts and change my direct deposit account info, but that wasn't too bad. i also had to change my payment info for my monthly bills. my rent charges a $25 fee if i use a credit card, so it pays straight from my savings account. after that, all i had to do is use the right card for the right purchase. the automatic payments take care of the rest. i'm only using 4 of my 6 monthly transactions for my savings account.

**results**

this setup won't make you rich, but i guarantee it will be better than ""typical"" banking. it will save you 2% to 4% on almost all of your purchases and will earn you \~2.2% apy on more of your money. since it's a percentage-based difference, the benefit is different for each person and is also different month-to-month. the best part is how simple it is. once you get it set up, it's mostly automated. just use the right card for the right purchase, and don't spend money you don't have.",10
"does anyone have the amazon reward credit card just for amazon purchases?. i'm a prime subscriber and buy a good bit of products via amazon.

"tips from a first time home owner 1 year in. it seems there's a post about home ownership at least once a week. i thought i'd share my learnings one year after buying my first home.

1. be clear about why you're buying a home. every large decision you have to make about home ownership should somewhat tie in to this. i can't stress this enough. make sure the reason makes sense to you after you and your so (if applicable) sleep over it a few times. don't get in to home ownership because your friends or colleagues are telling you how much they love owning their home. it might not be the same for you. again, be clear. i'd say literally write it down.

2. if you're buying a home together with your so (i'd imagine most might), sit separately with different pieces of paper and write down what each of you wants in your home. be realistic. indicate what you're ok with compromising on and what is absolutely a must have (or must not have). don't talk to each other while doing this. once you're satisfied with the list, tally what you have and combine what you want, don't want, what's a must have and what you can compromise on. be realistic.

3. use one of the online tools to calculate ""how much house can i afford"". don't spend more than 30-40% of your annual income on home ownership - this includes your mortgage, insurance, property tax etc. i'd say stick to 30% or less. edit: 30% of take home pay is what my max was. i ended up buying lower than that. your scenario may be different. the col in your area will probably affect this number.

4. look at houses based on the life style you have not the life style you aspire to have. for example we looked at houses with smaller yards or yards without large lawns. reason: our lifestyle and gardening aren't compatible. we'd have loved a large green lawn but realistically we'd never maintain it and probably wouldn't spend on a gardener. that's just one example. don't dream of building a home theater in the basement if you're the outgoing type.

5. ""buy the biggest house you can afford"" is horrible horrible advice. this was given to me by most people around me. it sounded bad then and after a year in, it sounds just horrible. buy the house that you need today with _some_ consideration for tomorrow's needs. tomorrow's needs is something along the lines of growing family not anticipating profits from business or promotions. the advice given on this sub holds true here too - buy below your means.

6. avoid borrowing money from friends or family in order to afford a bigger home. this is kind of an off shoot of the point above. both points will just lead to additional stress that you don't need. this is true even if they're willingly offering you money without you asking.

7. really look in to total cost of home ownership. if you're looking in to a fixer upper things can get very tricky. i'd recommend not going for a fixer upper for a first time home owner. i bought a relatively new home but the cost of minor fixes baffled me. i'm very very happy to not have bought a home that needed repairs. i'd have underestimated the cost even if someone would have given me quotes for the repairs. things like regulations change. a minor change might end up with large expenses to keep up with code. i learned this the hard way when i wanted to get an additional power outlet. :\

8. drive around the neighborhoods that you're interested in. get a feel of the place. chat with people who're out for walks or something and see what they think. this might lead to interesting results. when i did this, people thought i was selling something so their immediate reaction to my ""hi"" was ""i'm good. thanks."". :|

9. a home purchase is often a process of elimination. start with all homes that match your criteria. filter based on cost, then filter based on neighborhood, then filter based on square footage, school districts etc. keep going until you're left with a few homes that you'll go look at.

10. your agent facilitates the transaction. if you don't know what you want and haven't communicated with them very clearly, they may influence your decision. if you feel your agent is pressing you into making decisions - run. better than having buyers remorse after having gotten in large debt.

11. feel free to use your agent to do the ground work. i gave my agent a list of questions to go figure out for the houses/neighborhood/hoas etc that i was interested in. you're paying your agent a good sum of money. get your money's worth. don't shy away from asking questions. (your agent might tell you that you won't pay him. that's partly true. you won't pay them directly - the seller usually accounts for this and prices the home accordingly. so in a way, you are paying him.)

12. it's in your best interest to not have the same agent as the seller. 

13. don't skimp out on the essentials - for example home inspection. it may be expensive to do but it's better than being stuck with a flawed house. edit: /u/surewtever: consider getting a radon inspection (quick google tells me there are diy kits that are available).

14. protect your investment - get good insurance. make sure you're aware of what's covered and what's not. change the locks before you move in. change the lock on the mailbox. invest in a home security system if your neighborhood warrants it. consider cameras at the very least. 

15. find out how the hoa is if it exists. i've heard horror stories from colleagues. a couple of them have sold their condos because of the stress it caused them.

16. consider your mortgage options. depending on how long you plan to live in your home, arm might be a good option. 

17. after you buy your home, don't feel compelled to set it up immediately. that means it's ok to use the current furniture you have. it's ok to not have a proper bed. (we're still using a box + mattress combo - no frame or headboard). it's ok if one or more of your rooms look spartan for a year or two. 


that's all i can think of now. i'll add more if i think of something. good luck!

edit:
thanks for the gold.

some thoughts on comments:

**take 'home advice' (including mine) as just that - advice. surely give it thought, but you know your scenario better than anyone else does. some of the above points might not fit your needs. imho, it's better to be aware of a line of thought and reject it than to be ignorant of it and end up in a stressful situation.**

""look at houses based on the life style you have not the life style you aspire to have""
someone used an example of aspiring to have a garage to work on cars. the way i look at that is that working on cars is already your thing. you're not kidding yourself in to doing something you've never done before or are not currently passionate about. a person like me buying a large garage because ""i'd like to get in to working on cars"" when i currently don't know anything about the trade would be a terrible mistake.

""buy the house that you need today with _some_ consideration for tomorrow's needs""
this should speak for itself. the suggestion is to consider tomorrow's needs but don't get carried away. you're not going to need a 4 car garage because you might make more money and might buy 4 cars.

re: these points are conservative. yes, they are. purchasing for a lot of people is often emotional. starting conservative for a first time home owner is not a bad idea.

"is this a scam? yes, more than likely it absolutely is.. i see so many posts in pf every day about is this a scam and if you have to ask the question, it more than likely is. 

i am currently dealing with this at my job and its just a mess.   one day last week our bank noticed a check number well out of sequence had cleared our account and the signature on the check wasn't one of our usual signors.  they contacted us and sure enough, some scammer got a hold of our account info and made new checks.   that was a week ago.  every single day a new check has cleared our account.   my company is not out any money, the next day the check that cleared is reversed and we get our money back.  you know who is getting screwed?  the people that are foolish enough to believe the story the scammer gave them and cash the check.  one guy actually deposited a $4950 check to his account that we saw go through.  he then googled our company, because our actual company name and address is on the check, and found our number and called.   he spoke to the receptionist to ask if it was a real check.  the scammer told him he could have his car wrapped for free and he'd get $500, he just had to take the $4950 check to his bank and deposit it, keep the $500 and send the remainder somewhere.   luckily for him, he thought to call us before he sent anything anywhere and is only going to be out the bounced check fee.    

every single day someone has cashed one of these checks, amounts ranging from $900 to $5,000.  another lady called us yesterday and said she got a check int the mail with a letter to call x number after receiving it.  instead she googled us and called to ask if it was a real check.  no ma'am, it sure isn't.  it seems they are using many different stories and scams with these checks and i think this is probably going to continue until we can finally get that account closed.  our police department can't do anything because the checks are being cashed all over the country and not in their jurisdiction.  they said its up to our bank but i'm not sure how much they are going to do either since none of us are out any money, its just the hassle and manpower to deal with it.  

it amazes me that anyone still falls for this but they absolutely do.  please, if it seems to good to be true, it 10000% is.",10
"what are the most valuable community college degrees?. from my own research, it seems like accounting, it related, some trade, and vocational nurse degrees are the best bet. what do y'all think? i'm trying to make some real progress in pay without taking on debt.",10
"my old college said that i didn't owe them any money before i left. now that i'm applying to other places they've sent me to collections and won't release my transcripts.. i went to a university in my state for one semester before withdrawing due to a lot of issues with them. in order to fully withdraw i had to get a paper signed off from the financial office showing that i did not have an outstanding balance with the school. i even triple checked with the financial office lady to confirm because i had withdrawn from a class which could have affected my scholarship. (i don't qualify for financial aid.) she assured me that i didn't owe anything and signed off on the form to let me go.  

over a year after withdrawing, i decided to apply to different colleges to finish my degree. once i started requesting transcripts from the college they said that they would not release anything because i owe them $8,000 and i've been getting calls from debt collectors about 3x per week. it took them over a year to realize that i dropped a class that would have voided my scholarship despite me telling them multiple times. they told me to pay online, but the online portal showed that they actually owed me money and that they were trying to bill me for a semester that i never attended. thankfully they undid the charges for the extra semester, but i still owe $8,000.  

i know that i have to pay them the money that i owe, but i honestly have no idea how to proceed. i'm only 22 and i don't make enough to pay them everything to get my transcripts in time for the upcoming semester. i will say that i do take some responsibility for not hounding the college enough so they fully updated my account but i feel like they also really dropped the ball...  

do i go straight through the debt collectors to pay off a little at a time and put off school for a while or am i able to take out a student loan to cover everything? like my username suggests, i am mega confused about what to do and any help or advice would be greatly appreciated! 


edit: thank you all so much!!! i honestly thought that maybe one or two people would reply so the amount of advice i've gotten so far is crazy. i'm going to get a copy of the form they signed off on and provide it to the debt collector. while i'm at the college i'm also going to try and negotiate the price down since they waited over a year and didn't give me any warning at all. if things don't work out i'll definitely be posting in /r/legaladvice",10

"with the help of pf, i've gone from $0/month in side money to $964/month. thank you for advice!. about a month ago i posted here asking for help with ideas on how to earn $10,000 in side money within a year's time (https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4460m6/i_want_to_save_up_10000_in_one_year_my_95_only/). i never thought it'd be possible, but i figured if people had ideas on how $10,000/yr might be possible, then earning a quarter of that, or even a third might be realistic. among the many helpful posts, someone recommended looking into online freelance job sites and recommended a particular one for web development. i created an account and spent 3 hours setting up my profile because i decided that if i was going to do this i 'm going to do it all the way and give it everything i've got. fast-forward 1 month and i've earned $964 after fees with more on the way! it has absolutely transformed my life. i've been able to convert what was utterly unproductive time (9:00pm - midnight) into real earnings and learn a ton along the way. 

i'm not posting this to give myself a pat on the back, and i know $964 isn't turning many heads on pf, but i've seen countless posts where people are really struggling to make ends meet and i just want to say, it's possible! the site i work through (i don't want to name it due to the promotion rules here) has all kinds of jobs they are looking to fill: web dev, excel, outlook, etc. chances are, you are good at something that somebody somewhere needs. i highly recommend to those who are looking for ways to earn extra income, get online and take a look at what's out there. i am far from an expert on anything, but due to the amount of work out there, i've managed to find places i do fit in. good luck to you guys!

"how do i convince my mom to not be tricked by a house flipping scam?. so my mom and dad want to spend $20k on a house flipping training program: https://www.thelist.com/33978/untold-truth-flipping-vegas/. my parents are retirement age, currently unemployed, renting ($2k/mo, cheap in socal) and has $x0k in savings. she has a real estate license and has sold a few houses over the years, so i think she feels somewhat more knowledgeable than the average joe.

my googling reveals that although the seminars and classes themselves are real (though questionable in practical value), it appears to be a way to sucker people into borrowing programs to fund home purchases.

i've tried to convince my mom that this is a shady sounding business and worried they'll blast thru all of their savings. my siblings and i are willing to help support their monthly expenses, find them a home to save money or invest in a property together. it seems to be a matter of pride that she wants to feel productive, successful and not reliant on us. i understand her desire but ironically, odds are that she'll fail and make things worse

any suggestions on how to convince her to save her money and channel her efforts elsewhere? thanks!!!

"went to hospital, they refused to even attempt to run my claim through insurance, now i have collections agencies calling me for $10,000! (us). so i went to the hospital back in february for reasons i will not discuss here.  i have great health insurance through my employer that does cover hospital stays.  i didn't yet have the card at the time of the stay because i just got the insurance and they hadn't mailed it to me yet, but i was covered during that time.

i have since been on the phone with the hospitals billing department and my insurer.  the insurer says i am covered and the hospital needs to submit a claim.  the hospital keeps claiming they don't have my information despite me giving them the card number over the phone and even having a representative from the insurer talk to them in a 3-way call.

now the bill has gone to the collections agency and hospital refuses to even try to submit a claim to the insurer, stating that its up to the collections agency and then rudely hanging up on me.  the collections agency says i have to take it up with the hospital when i explain the situation to them.

now i have people from india constantly blowing up my phone and i don't want this bullshit to drag down my credit score (so far it has not appeared on my credit karma reports).  can someone please tell me how to deal with this?",10
"how to prioritize spending your money - a flowchart (redesigned). **edit 3: .png version of flowchart: https://i.imgur.com/u0ocdri.png**

roughly two weeks ago, /u/beached89 shared(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4e8n3n/how_to_spend_your_money_the_flow_chart/) an informative flowchart on how to prioritize spending of personal income.

i like what he shared and think having a flowchart of that calibre can be a useful tool, so i decided to make some alterations and revise it into something i felt would be more polished in terms of reflecting what is in the pf wiki as accurately as possible.

my goals for this revision included:

* major aesthetic redesign to more closely reflect the simplified graphical version(https://i.imgur.com/fb7dtmh.png) of the how to handle $(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) pf wiki entry
* removal of arbitrary numbers and streamlining of certain node paths
* reordering of certain nodes to more closely reflect the pf wiki
* reworking of some information to more closely reflect the pf wiki
* replacement of the ""entertainment expenses"" node with a footnote on entertainment expenses due to its highly discretionary nature and its absence from the pf wiki

no single personal income spending flowchart can truly be a ""one-size-fits-all"" thing, there are scenarios where certain nodes might need to be moved around, but the vision was to have something *as close as possible* to a ""gold"" standard.

keeping that in mind, here it is—

**the flowchart v4:** pf - income spending priority flowchart(https://i.imgur.com/ccevqav.jpg)        
*previous versions*             
1(https://i.imgur.com/fsf0hng.jpg) 2(https://i.imgur.com/qaxycwz.jpg) 3(https://i.imgur.com/1rpekgq.png)

*changelog:* 
    
* ~~relocated ""pay any non-essential bills in full"" node after employer match nodes~~
* added title text to indicate this flowchart is us-centric  
* reattached missing arrow      
* changed phrasing from ""low risk, low volatility investments"" to ""savings or checking account""

due to the progression of the how to handle $(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) entry, there is some overlap present in the flowchart, particularly related to the emergency fund steps. i've tried a couple different things, but haven't been able to successfully rework the layout without the flowchart becoming unnecessarily convoluted/hectic. 

i'd love to get any feedback or insights regarding this, or anything else. your thoughts would be appreciated :)

again, the inspiration came from /u/beached89, so thanks to him for laying the groundwork for this. i'd also like to extend thanks to /u/dequeued who has given extensive feedback to help shape this into something that aligns well with the pf wiki.

i hope this is beneficial, and thanks for any feedback or thoughts you leave. if the consensus is there, i'll make sure to update as soon as i'm able to.

***edit 1:*** i am reading the feedback! thanks for all the comments, i truly appreciate it. i have uploaded a new version of the flowchart. changes may be slow, we want to make sure that any changes made stay true to the pf wiki, so thank you for the patience :)

***edit 2:*** after some discussion, i have reverted the changes implemented which relocated the ""pay any non-essential bills in full"" node. as much as it seems logical that it would be something done after employer matching, it's not realistic or reasonable, particularly when we consider that many people will be utilizing a chart such as this will already be on contracts for internet/phone services. as such, these bills do need to be paid before employer matching.

"a debt collector called me about a hospital bill that occurred before i was 18. i got a call from a debt collect today saying i owe $4,000 for an unpaid bill. i'm pretty sure it has to be from before i was 18 because i haven't been to the hospital in over 4 years(i'm 20 now). is there anything i can do about it without putting it back onto my parents? they already have enough debt as it is. my dad himself is currently approx. $70,000 in debt. my parents said our insurance should've covered it. they haven't gotten anywhere talking to insurance company just yet. what should i do? do i wait for them to actually get a response from the insurance company? what happens if i dispute it and i'm successful? i'm new to this and any advice would be helpful. if any more info is needed i will be happy to provide it.

edit: this post blew up far more than i ever expected. thank you everyone for you input and advice. what i've done: i've contacted the collector asking for the debt to be verified with all paperwork sent through certified mail. i've talked to the insurance provider asking for my policies and coverage for the time of bill to be mailed as well. now i suppose all i have to do is wait. i will update again if anything happens within a reasonable amount of time. thanks again to everyone.",10
"freezing your credit files at the 3 credit bureaus would not have saved you from the wells fargo scam.. i never banked with wells fargo. also, access to my credit files are frozen. this means nobody can check my credit history without my permission. in other words, no bank will issue a new credit card or open a new account ... since they would first want to verify my credit worthiness.  
now here is the outrageous loophole in the system - if you temporarily unfreeze your credit files so you can legitimately open a bank / credit account ... the current system allows that specific institution to have permanent access to your credit file even after you re-freeze it.  
so, in wells fargo's case they would have been able to access credit files regardless of whether they were frozen or not. moreover, i believe in this particular fraud, wells fargo employees opened accounts without going through the normal due diligence process.",10
"husband offered job that advertised $50k starting salary and offered him $30k. first time posting here. on mobile. 

so 20k less. he did feel like he wasn't as qualified but went for it anyway. the interviewer really liked him and gave the impression that he was *more* than qualified. we are obviously disappointed in the offer. what can he do? how does he counter offer and for how much? does he mention the job posting that stated 50k-100k (based on experience) starting and a $5k sign on bonus which also not included in the offer letter. 

appreciate any help you have to offer!

edit/update: thank you for all the responses. my husband and i read through them together and he is confident in the decision to counter offer (probably 60k) and if they don't come up, than he is walking. as many made clear, if they don't budge or choose to rescind the offer, than ""good riddance.""",10
"i ran a self-experiment where i went from using only cash to only credit.. for the past 11 months i ran a self-experiment where i first went from using only cash whenever possible (and debit online), to always using credit cards (and paying them off in full).  using ynab, i tracked all my spending and planned out a budget every month before that month began.  the result:

through credit cards, i earned $395.23 in 2-5% cash back but also spent 19% more overall compared to cash (resulting in a loss).  the biggest differences were:

* **pain vs. pleasure.**  whenever i used a credit card, because a part of me would think about cash back, it was fun.  even though i was buying something, it felt like i was getting free money.  yet because that feeling simply did not exist when using debit, purchases felt more like losses and uncomfortable.

* **convenience.**  the credit cards were undoubtedly easier to use so i spent more on food delivery (mostly ubereats) and at vending machines.  surprisingly, simply not wanting to get cash from an atm was enough to prevent me from getting delivery, and not wanting loose change stopped me from using vending machines.

* **restaurants.**  similar to the first point, because i knew i was going to be using debit i was more mindful of the cost.  yet due to that almost subconscious part of me that would think about free money with credit cards, i was simply more likely to feel ""this is fun"" and order based on emotion.

while i am well aware that my self-experiment is not at all scientific (there could be other reasons why i spent more on credit), i am surprised at the result because i've been budgeting and using credit cards for years.  i have consistently had $150 budgeted every month for restaurants for example, and while with credit cards i would think, ""i still have $x left to spend,"" with debit i just didn't want to.

it's incredible how subtle and yet powerful the lure to use credit cards can be.  i suppose i could just have better self-control, but i have zero debt, live below my means, and did this experiment for almost a year, so i think i have pretty good self-control anyway.

"my family is very poor and my dad just died. what steps do i need to take?. my dad just died. we're very poor. he's been sick for a while but very sick for the last month and he hasn't had a source of income for years and didn't have enough ""work credits"" to qualify for disability or whatever. he was living in a roach-infested trailer that he built himself along with two homeless ex-cons he had taken in (who had nowhere to turn) that would be considered condemned if it were anywhere other than a remote rural area. he lived with my mother and my grandmother. my grandmother suffers from a severe case of paranoid schizophrenia and my poor mom was taking care of them both while working a very poorly compensated job, from which she had taken a break in recent times to care for him. their only source of income aside from my grandmother's ssi is me, which isn't to say much.

"learn the basics of car maintenance, get involved with your car's maintenance. even if you don't physically do the work, know what it takes to go from a to b.... something i was never offered in high school and i wish i was, was a driving class that you got your hands dirty with. luckily, i have some very mechanically talented family members who i've been able to walk through issues with. i have the ability to change my brakes or change the oil. other than that, i'm not very useful with my hands, but i at least know some basics in terms of different parts on a car, what they do, how they help other parts function, etc.

if you can get with someone you trust, watch them work on a car or have them walk you through how to do it yourself. i see it more and more now. younger kids (and it's not just reserved to that age group) know absolutely dick about cars and it's not a good thing. did you invest four digits into your car? maybe you splurged and invested 5 digits. you bought a reliable honda or a subaru for $14k because you've heard good things and you want a car to last you for awhile. if you're willing to invest that kind of money into something you use every day, you need to invest the time to learn what makes the thing tick.

aside from knowing how to change a tire, you should look up resources online to see what makes the car go vroom vroom and not fek....feeeek....fekfekfek... 

knowing something simple like the difference between drum brakes and disc brakes could save you asinine amounts of money at a later date.

edit: some mechanics appear to be increasingly shady these days and they can and will take you to the woodshed if you're not careful. my dad once had an issue with his suv... the mechanic said it needed a new engine. he took it to a trusted friend and it just needed a valve adjustment. almost 7 years later and that car is still running. that's roughly $5-10k in cost compared to a $100-200 valve adjustment...

edit: not all mechanics are bad, but one bad experience can put a sour taste in your mouth.

when i was in college i got a routine oil change at a national tire and battery. dudes told me i needed to have calipers put on my rear brakes. my brakes were drum brakes. drum brakes don't have calipers. knowing this simple factoid about brakes helped me save probably $300-500 and honestly who knows what the fuck they would have done had i let them work on my brakes. 

again, if you have time time to search and purchase a multi thousand dollar car, then you have the time to do research and learn about what you're driving. do it. you may find that you're actually mechanically inclines and enjoy working on your vehicle. it could save you a few bucks or maybe even a few thousand bucks.

i can not recommend https://haynes.com/en-us/car-manuals enough. these guys write complete guidebooks and complete breakdown and repair of many models/makes of cars. you can quickly become an expert on what your car is by reading these. sure you may not be able to do the work, but you'll know what makes your car tick and it will help you be a better informed consumer, especially when trying to find good mechanics for the more complex stuff.


edit: i've changed the mechanic/trust part a bit because people didn't like the perceived generalization. i'll repeat it here: not all mechanics are shady. good mechanics are great, but if you have one bad experience it's souring and really effects someone and makes it hard for them to find one they can trust. do your research. talk to the mechanic.",10
"my bank has not yet deducted my rent payment from my account. it has been nearly 2 weeks and my apartment complex says they've been paid in full.. hello. so every month i move around $1,000 into my account and pay my rent using my apartment complex's online portal. i pay directly from the account and my understanding is that this is treated as a digital check. the apartment complex accepts payment immediately and clears my balance, and the bank itself typically takes 3 days to deduct that payment from the account. 

this past month, the bank just didn't take the money out. it's still sitting in the account i used to pay. the apartment complex confirms that i'm paid in full, and i paid a bit early last month so it's been nearly 2 weeks now since i've paid. 

i can't imagine the bank would make this kind of mistake (it's one of the bigger banks in the us), but they've never taken anywhere near this long to collect the money after my payments.

guess i'm just wondering if this is something i should be concerned about. i plan on leaving the money in there until the end of the month at minimum just to cover myself in case they deduct it. but if they don't, am i clear to assume that it's still 'my' money or do i have anything to worry about?",10

"being charged a $100 restocking fee on an order i cancelled immediately. do i have any recourse?. edit 3: since numerous people keep asking, this is how i was able to resolve it:
- i spoke with 3 different reps about cancelling my order. the first said they couldn't cancel orders and that i must wait for the product to arrive then schedule a return.
- i reached out again and the second rep confirmed they are able to cancel, but would charge a 15% restocking fee. after i politely informed the rep that i did not believe i should be charged this fee, i was transferred to a third rep. 
- this rep essentially repeated what the second rep said, and i politely asked for my case to be escalated.
- a manager reached out to hear my case. i explained everything calmly and he agreed that the restocking fee didn't make sense in my case. he double checked my order and confirmed it hadn't processed yet, and no product had moved. he stated they would process the cancellation as normal.
- i received an email shortly after confirming the cancellation. the refund was posted to my credit card, and no restocking fee was charged.

**edit 2: i appreciate the continued support and advice hours later, but i've successfully remedied the situation. all good here. thanks!!**

edit: i was polite yet persistent and was able to get my order cancelled without a fee. i'll definitely do my research in the future before ordering from a new place. thanks to everyone for the advice!

i ordered a tv on dell's website and decided against it an hour later. i contacted them about cancelling an order and a rep stated that i will be charged a 15% restocking fee, or about $100.

when i asked for a link to this policy, they referred me to their return policy. i stated that i am not returning anything because i don't have the product, merely cancelling an order. but they refuse to not charge the ""restocking"" fee.

is there anything i can do in this scenario? it feels like a scam to make some money off of cancelled orders. i should add the order is still ""processing"" so they've essentially done nothing with the actual order so far, yet need to charge to ""restock"" it.",10

"robinhood will begin offering checking and savings. # update thread here(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a69km8/update_robinhood_checking_and_savings_may_not_be/)

**due to issues with robinhood referral spam, this is the one and only thread we are going to allow on this topic.**

___

**overview:**

robinhood is launching a new zero-fee checking and savings account feature.(https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2018/12/13/introducing-robinhood-checking-amp-savings)

- no monthly fees, no overdraft fees, no foreign transaction fees, and no minimum balance.
- 3% interest rate
- mastercard debit card issued through sutton bank.
- **not a bank account, insured by the sipc instead of the fdic and may not qualify for sipc protection, see below**
- free access to 75,000 atms, many of which are located in such retailers as target, walgreens, and 7-eleven.
- signing up people now, but debit cards won't be active until january.

___

**sipc coverage:**

robinhood claims(https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001469903) that accounts will be covered by the sipc. however, this claim now appears to be dubious given comments by the director of the sipc, who, in an interview with bloomberg, said(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-14/sipc-says-it-has-serious-concerns-about-robinhood-s-new-product):

> ""i disagree with the statement that these funds are protected by sipc,"" stephen harbeck, president and chief executive officer of sipc, said in an interview friday. ""had robinhood called us, i would have told them what i just told you in that i have serious concerns about this. this has gigantic ramifications for the banking industry.""

current media coverage of this issue tends to support the idea that robinhood checking funds would not qualify for sipc coverage (here(https://www.axios.com/robinhoods-new-checking-account-b2b0df32-40c6-4bd1-b336-2408b27f16b0.html), here(https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/sipc-chief-raises-concerns-to-sec-about-robinhoods-free-checking-accounts.html), and here(https://www.barrons.com/articles/robinhood-app-is-offering-a-3-interest-rate-to-take-on-the-banks-51544723146)).

"$15,000 missing from bank of america accounts. pennsylvania, us

i just awoke from a nap to find an email that one of my accounts with boa fell below a $25 balance. i logged on to my account to find a $1,000 ""cashed check hold on 11/21"" transaction on my checking account and 5 separate transactions for $1,000, three for 3,000 and one for 4,000 from my savings account.

i immediately called their customer service line and was directed to the claims department. the representative basically gave me no information aside from telling me ""these are check cash holds"" that had to have been initiated by a teller (?) and asked if i had written any checks for these amounts. i don't have any checks for my savings account, and obviously i have not done so or i wouldn't have called the customer service line in a panic.

she told me i'd need to call their check cashing department (i don't believe i have that name right) which had closed 5 minutes prior to my call, so now i have to wait until tomorrow.

does anyone have any experience with this happening with bank of america? she wasn't able to give me any information as far as my next steps or what to expect going forward.

edit: wow, this got way more attention than i expected. thank you everyone for the information. as mentioned in a few comments i'll be visiting the branch tomorrow and calling the check fraud department if nothing gets resolved on site. i'll also be opening new accounts with a different institution and migrating direct deposit and automatic payments. i'll post an update here tomorrow for anyone curious.

***update:*** i just got off of the phone with the check fraud department. they opened two claims for each account. as of this morning, the transactions are no longer ""pending"" and have new descriptions along the lines of ""md tlr cash withdrawal from chk #### banking ctr <location, #> confirmation# <#>"", for four different locations in maryland. i think the most likely explanation is that someone got into my online banking, got my account numbers, physically went to these branches and made the withdrawals at the counter. seems pretty ballsy.

the fraud department froze both of my accounts and my debit card (i now have two balances of -888,000). i'll be going to the branch to provide some additional information and file a police report, per the discussion i had with the fraud department. they said it could take up to 60 business days for them to complete their investigation, at which time i may need to fill out an affidavit and be able to get my money back.

***update 2:*** i visited the branch this morning and the manager was very helpful, giving me additional information on the investigation (and subsequent refunding) process. so, shoutout to mr. ramos. he opened new accounts & issued a temporary debit card which i will probably not even be using, and was able to get the remaining funds i had available (~$750.00) transferred over from the frozen accounts. he told me i should fax the police report to the fraud department, then call and speak to a manager and they should be able to issue a provisional credit for the full amounts that were stolen. he seemed as baffled as anyone else that these were apparently in-person transactions at 4 different branches in maryland (these branches all appear to be along highway 355 from frederick down to gaithersburg) and no one raised any alarm bells. he said ""we have safeguards in place, this shouldn't have happened"".

the two officers i spoke to at my local pd said similar things, that the perpetrator must have used a fake id, gone to each bank and gotten a blank check and filled it out with my account numbers. unfortunately i live in a pretty small town and they told me the report wouldn't be ready until friday or possibly monday, but in the mean time i've given the case number to the fraud department.

here's a brief timeline of the events and my actions:

* fraudster acquired my account details by some currently unknown method (possibly through a data breach/online banking hack, no checks were stolen or lost that i'm aware of, and my personal computers & devices are all free of malware)
* fraudster visited four separate bank of america branches in maryland and drained my accounts in six separate transactions on 11/21, probably using a fake id.
* i received a low balance notification on 11/21 and called bank of america customer service line at 7:50 pm - was not given much information and told to call check fraud department in the morning
* i made this personal finance post, and on the advice of a few users started documenting everything including drafting a letter to send to the fraud department
* called check fraud department at 8:10 am on 11/22, accounts and debit card were frozen and two fraud cases opened
* visited my local branch and spoke with the branch manager, new accounts opened and available funds transferred
* visited local pd and spoke with two officers - gave them copies of my fraud department letter and all supporting documents

next steps:

* open new accounts with local credit union to use once this is resolved
* get copy of police report on friday or monday to fax to fraud department
* call fraud department and hassle manager for provisional credit
* wait for up to 60 days for fraud investigation to complete, everyone i spoke to indicated this shouldn't take this long and would almost certainly resolve in my favor
* hopefully local & md police can identify the perp and arrest them because doing this to someone is widely regarded as a ""dick move""

i'm not really sure what else to add at this point - i'll update again with any new developments - but at this point i'll be **disabling inbox replies** for this post as the comments coming in now (like at least 20 essentially saying ""fuck bank of america""/""don't use bank of america"") aren't very helpful. i've already stated several times i'll be switching institutions, though i may keep the new boa accounts open with minimal balances ""just in case"". i'll be moving the majority of my assets to the local cu.

big thanks to everyone who did leave helpful comments and offer their sympathies - i really appreciate it. if anyone has additional suggestions or questions that haven't been answered, feel free to pm me or reply to one of my comments below. if you leave a top-level comment i probably won't see it after saving this update.

"my parents are in severe debt and want me to take out a bank loan for them. is my solution to their problem viable?. my dad was laid off in june 2016 and has struggled to find a stable job since. he and my mom live in a $350k house that they'll never pay off. i've told them until i'm blue in face to sell the house and find a cheaper living option but they refuse to do so.

this morning he sent me this email:

>""i am in deep financial turmoil and need help. my credit is shot and can't get a loan on my own. i need $6,000 for the following expenses.

>mortgage         $3,800.00

utility_gas      $288.17 
utility_water    $202.36

>you can get a personal loan for me from sun trust or wells fargo bank. i will make the monthly payments till the loan is paid in full. if you don't want to do it or, can't do it, please let me know.""

the last thing i want is a high interest bank loan in my name, but i also don't want my parents to be broke. my solution is for them to sell the house, pay off the mortgage and get back the roughly $70-$80k they have tied up in it, and use that to rent somewhere cheap. that amount could potentially sustain them for years until my dad is old enough to collect social security (he's 61 now). however, i don't know a lot about how mortagages and home ownership work to know if this is a viable plan. any advice is appreciated.

edit: to clarify, these are not just one month's worth of expenses. their monthly house payment is about $1600/month and the hoa fee is yearly, but both have late fees because they're overdue.",10
"19yo - need to move out immediately. i barely have any idea of what i'm supposed to be doing.. my parents' home is no longer safe. i'm currently living in my car in the florida heat, no working ac. the driver side window is also not working :)). i drive about 35 mins to and back from work to shower/get ready for the day at a friend's.

i managed to sneak my birth certificate + ss card out of the house before i left.

i make $12/hr, get about 140hrs a month. in 5 months it'll be 12.50 or 13/hr. working on getting full-time, it's looking like that will happen.

haven't opened a credit card yet.

as far as monthly payments go, i pay 120 for car insurance and 50 for my phone bill. i plan to try and cut down the phone bill drastically. a smartphone is required at my job as my department uses an app that's connected to inventory.

my car is nearing the end of its life unfortunately. 160k miles, i've had to replace so many things that the cost of repairs has to have piled up to around 2k as i just dropped 1k to fix the brake pads, brake fluid lines, gas tank, etc.. some of the repairs were diy like the spark plugs & battery. it's costing me more and more money and i don't have the means to actually keep it around anymore. idk what to do with it, i've been thinking about trading it in and financing a car or saving & buying a used in full when i have the money to. what should i do?

i don't have anything in savings atm, i have 1k in my checking but that's it. i dropped my emergency fund on car repairs which were deathly needed.

as far as rent goes i'm content with paying 300-400/mo w/ roommates. my area (daytona/ormond) has cheap apartment complexes which aren't completely horrible for that price range. i don't know if i should try and drop that down with the imminent replacement of my current car

"i just got a 50% raise. $60k to $90k. i just got a 50% raise. details below:

i've been in my current role for about 10 months and doing very well, but feeling a bit under-valued. after some 1:1 sessions with my manager, he suggested i ask for a raise. was making $60k/yr, and the increase just got approved for $90k/yr. started the conversation with an email. here's how the email to hr looked: 

1) **state my case** - was direct, asking for an increase in compensation, with high-level logic.

2) **logic** - went into detail on my work, the value i bring, and the positive feedback i've received.

3) **data** - linked data on median pay for my role/responsibilities from sites such as bureau of labor & statistics, glassdoor.com, and salary.com.

"firefighter (47m), i got injured on the job and now i have to retire. i wasn't planning on this, so i have several questions and need lots of advice.. some back story- like i said, i'm 47 and had 20 years 3 months and 7 days of service under my belt when i got injured on a fire last october. after 4 neck and back surgeries, the docs said i have to retire. my medical retirement took effect november 8th of this year. 

i received my pension letter from the fire department yesterday, and i was somewhat relieved to learn that i will be receiving 60.25% of base pay, tax free (the % is based off my impairment, and i had been told it could have been as low as 45%). 

my questions. 
my pension papers clearly say that i am allowed to work, however, i have heard that if i make over a certain amount of money, it can make part or all of my disability taxable. the only thing i've found online so far concerns social security benefits, but i'm assuming my pension fund has similar rules. i'm not all that concerned about this, as of now i don't plan on filing any w2's in the near future.

however, i am considering taking a large chunk from my deferred comp (457b) plan, and paying off all my debt (mortgage, last remaining credit card, and a home equity loan). 

first of all, is this stupid? 
becoming debt free would put me in a position to continue building a savings near the same rate i was able to before i retired (and that's not counting any side income i earn). it also would be a huge stress relief, especially after all the uncertainty of the past year...and that alone seems like the biggest selling point to me.

my concern is, while there is no penalty for withdrawing the money, it says it will be ""taxed as income"", which has me worried that it would count against my disability income, like income from working a job would (if that is indeed the case), and i'd have to pay taxes on some or all of the disability income as well, which doesn't seem correct, but unfortunately i'm pretty ignorant with all of this. 

everything lately just seems like such a huge decision, i just don't want to do anything stupid.

thanks in advance for any insight or advice, and let this be a lesson for you young whippersnappers, you're never too young to start preparing and educating yourself about retirement!
now let me see if i can do this right, i've been practicing-

"mit's living wage calculator is actually pretty accurate. for those people wondering how much they should strive towards making without having to live paycheck to paycheck, the mit living wage calculator (http://livingwage.mit.edu) is actually pretty accurate. i field tested it against my own numbers/estimations and came up with pretty similar results. for instance, it lists a livable wage in west palm beach florida to be 11.30 hourly. after deducting taxes and estimated cost of living, i came up with a comfortable $300 a month ""discretionary"" income in which you could use to pay off debt, save, or any other goals. check it out and tell me what you fellow ""numbers geeks"" think!

"a cautionary tale for young students and letting your parents handle your student loans. i hope this has been covered here before but i wanted to share my experience to try and help others from going down the same path.

rule 1) the most important thing to remember is to never trust anyone when it comes to money and yes, this includes your own family. always know your financial status, especially if you are going to be the one footing the bill later.

rule 2) manage your own financial aid while in school. i know it is more work and sometimes it can be too much to take if it is your first time but this gives you experience in handling loans and you will benefit from this later. plus, you know exactly what you are in for once you graduate. need assistance? that's what the financial aid office is for. only involve others when it is an absolute must and for god sake don't give your financial login info to your parents or anyone else for that matter.

if you follow these simple rules, you should be able to avoid the mess i have gotten myself into.

now story time:

while in school, my parents took it upon themselves to manage my money. they made sure i had my school expenses covered and that i had enough overage to cover my living costs, etc. i thought all was fine. i mean i did struggle sometimes at the end of a semester where i ran out of cash, but they would eventually give me a little ""help"" to get me through (keep this in mind, it becomes important later). i did find it odd that anytime i asked about my financial situation, they would give me an excuse and would never really let me take a look, but, i mean, they are trustworthy, right? i mean they raised me after all. boy was i wrong

fast forward to graduation (2010).

loans are coming due and i have no job. so, i didn't really push my parents about getting my loan info. however, whenever i did, i thought something was odd since my parents tried to hide some of my loan information from me or they just wouldn't give it to me. they said not to worry about it though and that they were taking care of them and would start to pay them back for me.

at this point, the grace period is up for my loans. i push my parents for my student loan info. they finally give it to me, turns out, they haven't made a single payment and i am overdue for all of my loans. they say i need to get my shit together and get these loans under control. this is typical for my parents, being a root cause and blaming others, so i didn't really think that much about it.

i did finally get most of it ironed out and figured out i was close to $90,000.00 in debt. now, at first, i just normalized this and thought everyone graduated with this much debt over their heads (in state public uni). i mean, it did take me 5 years to graduate after all.  so, i stopped looking into my loans and just started paying them.

fast forward to present day.

here i sit, about 8 years after graduating. still in debt and still piecing the puzzle together of why i owe so much. there were some red flags that i should've caught but didn't. however, recently, i found out about nslds, the national student loan database. i highly recommend using this. from here, i found out that i did have grants that covered most of my college tuition. furthermore, i found that my parents, including grant money, took out over $25,000.00 per semester for my last year. after covering the semesters tuition, books, and rent, it still set me up for over $2,000.00 a month in spending money. remember when i said i ran out of money at the end of the semester? yeah, that should've never happened.

it turns out, they were pocketing most of the overages.

now, i know this looks bad but really, it's because it is.  my parents were going through a financial hardship at the time (dad was laid off). however, this never gives anyone the right to take money from you. they pretty much made their problem my problem.

the issue is, in my opinion, your family is more apt to take advantage of you than anyone else. they have already gained your trust and you look to them for life advice and guidance for most of your childhood. this is where i messed up, i should've never put that much trust into anyone.

however, the fault is both ways. from what i have seen, parents, in particular, are even more apt to take advantage. they tend to justify it to themselves fairly easily. for example, when they originally did this, they most likely thought this would get them by until they were able to pay my student loans. they kept telling me that they wanted to help me pay and that they wanted to pay for my college....they just seem to over estimate what their financial future will look like and have never been in a position where helping me was an option. now, here i am suffering from their lack of money management competence.

if i was more willing to deal with my student loans myself, this would have been something that i could have immediately caught. i mean, how hard would it have been to see that much in overages?

in conclusion, just don't trust people with money. they may have good intentions at the time but that's all it turns out to be. be vigilant. know what your expenses are and only take what you need and finally, if someone is taking care of your loans for you and won't send you an overview immediately when asked, you should stop everything and figure out what is going on.

i used to be one of those people who were always saying, i would hate to be one of those people who's own parents screwed them over....turns out i was one all along. the student loan racket just makes it too easy for parents to take advantage. don't let this happen to you. no matter how much your parents say they support you, your paperwork could say something different. money is just a special niche and makes people do things they may not have done otherwise or things they ""think"" they can correct before anyone would notice.

edit 1: a lot of people are saying i am making large generalizations that don't apply to most situations. that's the point. i know i am. it may not apply and i didn't think it would apply to me either. it is why i am in this mess and why this is a cautionary tale. not only does doing your own financial aid help you understand and better manage your loans after graduation. it helps you from people, as close as they may be, from taking advantage. so, really, you are the one that benefits.

other than that, i am sorry for anyone else who has been in the same situation. good luck to you! however, this has really opened my eyes to just how rampant this is. all the more reason to take care of it yourself.

edit 2: wow. i was really not expecting this but thank you all for the support! for all of the speculation out there, no, i do not have a relationship with my parents anymore, other than the occasional visit once every year or two. and yes, of course this is fraud. however, as others have stated, with student loans it is a niche thing. it is not as black and white as if they just took a regular loan out in my name. i wish it was but it is just not. this is the point of this post. i would never wish for anyone to be stuck in the situation that i am. i have made my mistakes, i just want people to learn from them, that's all. 

as far as any remaining questions go, i will try and answer them but this was way more than i could've ever imagined so it might take me a little time.  ",10
"we have a total wedding cost of about $8000 (which we have). is it worth getting a credit card to put it all on for the rewards? if so which one? (credit score is just under 800). we figured if we are going to drop $8000 over the course of a year (possibly all in a few months) is there a great credit card that would be worth the rewards? possibly something that could help pay for a portion of our honeymoon to scandinavia (flight or hotel). 

we don't need to put our wedding on a credit card as we have saved up and could pay cash. we both have great credit. 

also please save all wedding lectures about it being a waste of money to yourself. we do very well and 8k is modest for what we are getting.

edit 1:: i didn't expect this to blow up. thank you all for the advice. a few things i'd like to say.

thank all of you who broke down the numbers for me! i have a lot of great options. this has been my first really positive experience on reddit. 

i'd like to clear up some things people didn't read correctly in my post: 

-i am not taking out any loans!!! i have the money and could pay it all in cash right now. i tutor as a hobby and side income and it has been very profitable over the last few years. this wedding is being paid for by my enjoyment of teaching children math. 

-i am not going use any referral links so stop sending me messages with them

-i understand some people think weddings are a waste of money. but this money is literally extra and i'm not sacrificing a shred of happiness, time, or other expense paying for it. my fiancee and i are very excited to celebrate our love with a small group of family and friends modestly and intimately. 

edit 2:: 

-i will post to r/churning on wednesday when i'm allowed (they are strict)
- the main venue cost has already given us a 25% discount so asking for a deeper cash discount is greedy. though we might do that for some other stuff. 

edit 3:: 
- mod from r/churning reached out directly to me because of the popularity of this post. so thank you all (even the assholes) for making this post as big as it became 

-the internet is filled with some really mean people who have sent me really mean messages. sorry my wedding budget (which is super cheap) has offended so many of you. 

-luckily the internet is also filled with super amazing people who have been super helpful!!! i even gave my first silver to someone who deserved it.

"i'm sick of how people with above-average student loan debts are treated in this sub (and why you should be too). i have been lurking a lot in here for the past few months (with a couple posts) to try and figure out my financial situation. as i read more and more, i find myself disgusted with how you guys treat people with student loan debt above the average (which is like 30k now). 

my story is probably similar to a lot of the loan carriers, so i will share an abbreviated version of it:

it is 2006. i am entering my senior year of high school, and my dad and mom are both working, doing well. combined, they are probably making about 250-300k. they, along with the rest of pre-recession america, are telling me college is the way to middle class, and that they have saved up enough for me to go almost anywhere that's not ivy league. i chose a university that costs about 26k a year.

fast forward a bit. it's 2009. my dad has lost his business, and is now using my college savings to keep everything afloat. i am about to enter my junior year of college, and my parents tell me i will have to take loans out to continue. i have suffered two years in engineering already, and do not wish to quit. i continue on.

it's 2011. i graduate, and although i have a job lined up, many of my friends didn't. america is now telling us ""college is worthless lol"" and the grim realization hits us that the entire economy has changed. i cannot move home because i decided to keep my sanity instead of my money, and at this point my dad was an abusive alcoholic and my mother was extremely depressed.

i do not share this out of pity. i have about 62k of loans and am making 75k, so i will be paying them off within a few years. but god dahmit, there are people worse off and i feel for them, because i chose a career that makes money simply because it's what i enjoyed most. i got lucky. if i enjoyed something that didn't pay as much, i would be in a much worse situation.

if we want to have serious conversations about this, we cannot expect every 17-18 year old to have the financial knowledge of accountants. most of the progenitors of college students also have extremely lacking financial knowledge, which is why you hear of this in the first place. most 18 year olds are thinking about beer and having sex (well, i still think about that a lot), not about retirement, 401ks, healthcare, etc. you can think it's wrong all you want, but that is reality. 

so i ask of you, please get off your high horse. none of us are rich, and most of us will never be. we are all in this rat race together. instead of saying ""screw you i got mine"", be more accepting of the fact that people are actually making an effort to pay their debt, and will speak highly of this sub. thank you.

"debt collection negotiation script. so i made this script for my wife.  she has to call and handle some debt collection from credit cards we stupidly incurred in our early 20's then defaulted on.

these are tactics that were modified from a decade of working in dealerships and watching successful car salesmen use them on customers for years.

**have a price and stick to it!!!**

they say: ""we'll settle this debt for $xxx""
you say:  ""i can't afford that right now.  how about $xx?""

they say: ""well we can offer payment plans!  how does $xx a month sound?""
you say: ""i can barely pay my bills with the money i make now.  i just received a little bit of extra money that i'm trying to pay bills with.  this has to be in one payment.""

**don't tell them anything about why you're paying debt off!!!**

they say: ""why are you trying to settle the debt?  are you trying to get a new car or a house?""
you say: ""no.  i'm simply interested in settling this debt.""

**don't be afraid to hang up!!!**

they say: ""we can't go any lower than this amount right now""
you say: ""well, unfortunately i have some other debts.  i can't afford your offer right now, so i'm going to contact them and see if they can settle for what i have.""

they'll come up with something to try to keep you on the line.  you have to stand firm that you simply can't afford their lowest offer at this time and you're going to search elsewhere.

**silence is your friend**

if you hit a lull in the negotiation (no matter what side), do not break the silence.  when this happens after an offer on either side, the first to break loses.  let them sit in the awkwardness of the silence.  if it was their offer, they'll ask if you heard them.  respond yes.  then let the silence settle again.  when they break it a second time, let them know that you can't make that payment and this may be an opportune time to say that you don't know if you can pay anything on this at this time and you're going to call some other debtors.

**all personal info hurts you/helps them**

do not reveal anything personal.  there is no situation where you will be able to use guilt, shame, or empathy on them.  they don't care.  they hear it every phone call.  nothing about your personal situation will help them, but talking about your kids and lack of (enter necessary item that requires good credit) will give them ammunition to drive their final price up.  you look desperate.  they have to be afraid that if they don't settle today, you won't ever pay them and you'll still be fine.  this is not an emotional issue.  emotions will be exploited.

by all means, feel free to add to this in any way.  i'll add/edit what i have in the original post with other good tips.  hopefully they can help people in similar situations.

edits: dealing with debt by phone call isn't always necessary.  as pointed out below by /u/thewitchof-el, you can contact them by mail and not have to deal with some of the hassle of trying to haggle.  you'll have to make your own decision on how pressing it is and whether or not you could wait a couple or several weeks to settle your debt.

from /u/remembertosmile

a few more things:

a debt settlement is different from paying a debt. look up how a ""debt settlement"" affects your credit in your state.

keep a log of your phone calls and always ask for a reference number. it makes it easy to continue the conversation if it requires multiple back and forth calls.

always get a copy of the settlement agreement in writing, before paying.

try to settle with the fees included. many collectors will charge a processing fee for paying via phone or wire.

"kohl's charge dispute nightmare. so someone got into our kohl's shopping account and ordered $1000+ worth of stuff and had it shipped to our house.  it was an odd thing, why would they do that?  i called and disputed the charges as i didn't really want the goods and they opened a case and said more information would be forthcoming.  

a week or so later i get a letter saying that they have determined that the charges were legitimate and that they have closed the case.  

in the mean time i have $1000 worth of stuff in my house waiting for ""further instructions""

i call back in and am a little frustrated at this point.  they explain that what the perps are after was the kohl's reward cash, which also goes into your shopping account as well as gets emailed to you.  

i do recall this from the first call, she said that she was going to ""get the kohls cash quick""... but that was all that was said at that point.

so i reiterate that i did not make the charges but wanted to know what i am supposed to do now.  

they said to just return the stuff to the store get my refund and be on my merry way.  easy enough... other than the inconvenience of doing so.

this is where it goes bad.

i return the stuff to the store... but they can't give me full credit for it because... someone spent the $200 kohl's cash already.  

cue the next phone call while the store manager (who was awesome i might add) works with me trying to resolve the issue... this isn't the first time they have seen this issue, at this store just the week prior they had another fraud return.  i'm guessing there is an exploit on their website somewhere that people have gotten into or something, they didn't get into our email or anything else... someone needs better site security

i digress.

anyway, turns our that the cash was indeed spent, and they track it down to a store literally across the country from me.  guy says ""no problem, i will put back in the dispute and they will clear up the $200 no problem... unfortunately i can't do it, i have to reopen the ticket with the original person running the dispute""

i'm starting to gather that this ""original person"" is a real moron.

ok, so i'm happy again.  things will get patched up no problem right?

wrong.

i get my bill a week or so later, the $200 is still on there and now they want me to pay for it.

i call in again.

this time i'm rather mad, i've been kind long enough but this is going on 5 weeks now.

turns out original person decided that since the kohl's cash was indeed delivered to our email address that we must have spent it ourselves... somehow teleporting across the country to do so, and also forgetting that the perps had access to our shopping account and got the cash info as it is instantly delivered with your purchase.

so now i open the dispute again, we spelled out the problem for mr./mrs original person what the problem is, explaining that it was spent in a different state, and that the shopping account which also contained the cash was compromised.

what other recourse do i have?  this stupid card doesn't have a visa/mc logo or anything on it.  i'm about to shred the whole thing and let it sit out there and dispute it at the credit agency level.

kohl's get your act together and secure your dumb website!

edit:

thanks for all the suggestions and help.  it is a great community here!

i did run the https://haveibeenpwned.com/ search, great idea btw.  one hit showed up but that site was only an email database, no passwords attached to it, leading me back to the idea that it is possibly an exploit on their website.  if you read down through the replies, it seems like it is an organized group doing this based on the types of items being purchased (rugs in several) they group that hit me also had the ability to spam our inbox trying to hide the order confirmation email among the garbage messages, no everyone has that ability.

"hit an amazing financial milestone today: $2k in my savings!. so, about 2 months ago, i posted about how my savings rescued me(http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/30izxg/can_i_post_a_triumph_even_if_it_isnt_thursday_i/) from a really expensive car-breakdown-disaster. according to that post i had/have been living from paycheck to paycheck up until like january, and i was just starting to figure out my saving routine as of march.

i checked my accounts today and i have *$2500 to my name.* it's crazy; in march, after those car repairs, i would have been looking at like $1000 in total assets, *maybe,* but today i have $2200 in savings and i feel so amazing.

i'm still keeping a piggy bank for change and the occasional cash i end up taking out for some reason and not using. i also have been putting my tips from my night job *straight into savings*, so that's $250 a week for the past four or five weeks. now that i've quit one of my jobs with the hope of going back to school, i have my total expenses in mind and i'm still going to be able to put away $400-$500 a month in savings and i'll survive. if i want to pick up another part-time job i would go back to putting one job's income into savings and living sparingly off of the other job. but i can't get over this, guys... i might not have huge problems but i really see this little victory as something big for someone who's always struggled with emotional spending! :)",10
"after 3+ years with no raise, is it time to find a new job?. i've worked at this company for \~4 years. the company isn't doing too hot (no layoffs but essentially just breaking even). i had a good/great review this week, and was told there's essentially no chance for any increase. even if we get x number of new customers (which is pretty much a best-case scenario), we're still below our goals so i don't see boom raises next year. what worries me most is that almost every coworker doesn't seem to care about the raises. 

i do want to say, i really really like working here.

"negotiating salary with a new company. would it be unprofessional to mention that i'd be walking away from a bonus with my current employer in hopes of getting a higher offer?. basically, i'm currently employed and considering leaving my job for a number of reasons. i've just received an offer with a new company. i made the unfortunate mistake of giving a salary range before learning about the new company's benefits, and i definitely undersold myself. the company just gave me a formal offer with a salary at the bottom of the range i gave them. it's about a 12% increase from what i make now, but i'd be losing some pretty fantastic benefits. i don't really feel like i can complain, but truthfully this would be a lateral move. i plan on negotiating, seeing as this isn't enough to get me to move.

now, my current company has just given me a bonus of $5k, but it won't hit my account until the end of the month. if i accept this offer i'm almost certain they won't honor the bonus and i can't blame them. would it be unprofessional to mention this bonus in my negotiations with the new company? or should i stick to talking about the benefits?

delaying my start date doesn't feel like an option seeing as i'd have to delay it almost 6 weeks to avoid giving my notice before the bonus is paid.

edit: thank you guys for all the encouragement and advice! i thanked them for the offer but told them truthfully what i needed to make the move worthwhile. fingers crossed. 

to all the folks recommending i just hang around till the bonus is paid and leave without notice—my industry is fairly small and people move around a lot, so there's a good chance i'll end up working with some of my current colleagues again in the future. burning bridges isn't really my style and it's definitely not a smart move in my case.",10
"just found out my equal co-worker makes 65% more than me.. hello all.

i work in a crossfit gym and just got a promotion to a full time salary position at $20k/yr + bonus per class i coach. i didn't think it was much but i figured that's what most coaches make so i signed it. 

go into the gym today and see another coach got a promotion to the same position at $33.5k. i saw it on a paper left out by accident i assume. i work much more than he does, i do more for the gym outside of coaching, i clean, i work 7 days a week vs his 4 or 5. it was very upsetting to me and demotivating. i do a much better job than he does, as said by my bosses themselves.

i love this job and work extremely hard but this is definitely hit me kinda hard. i feel undervalued. how do i approach my employer about this? 

update: scheduled a meeting with the owner tomorrow. going to try negotiate a better pay. i will mention that i saw the other workers salary and make my case for why i'm undervalued. i'll update you guys on what happens 

update: just had the meeting. told him i feel undervalued and what i bring to the company. he didn't seem like he was gonna budge but he's having a meeting today with the other owners to figure some stuff out and said he would have another meeting with me. i didn't bring up that i saw the other workers pay.

"son turns 14 today. this is his present teaching him the value of savings. doing it right?. here's the insert that goes with his present. 

http://imgur.com/a/qxj7n

i've rounded out the numbers obviously, but i think it works well to explain to a 14 year old the value of savings. it should spark a conversation with him about it more. 

both my kids already have educational savings accounts set up for them for college/university, and get regular presents. *anything else i should add/change about this?* he is also getting other gifts, but this is in my opinion one of the best ones that he probably won't fully appreciate until he's older.

**edit:** i went away for lunch, came back and this had gone bigger than expected. i am going to adjust the returns to be more realistic after reading the discussion. some feel i shouldn't make this part of his birthday as he might perceive he's been cheated a gift. he's not that sort of kid, and tends to get gifts for being awesome year round anyway. may post another update in 8-9 hours to report on how it was received. 

**update edit:** so the night of fun is over. he's upstairs having a blast with his presents, most happy with his new headset as was expected, and was interested in learning more about his savings present. as was expressed by many different people below, *your mileage may vary depending on the audience*. my 14yr was cool with it luckily.

"my friend had $1000 stolen from his account with chase and the bank is refusing to help, even going as far as to send a new card to the person who stole the money over a thousand miles away.. * according to my friend, in the middle of january he got a google security alert that someone attempted to login to his email. he ignored the email (a mistake). 

* a couple days later, he got an automatic notification that someone tried to spend $700 with his card, and the notification asked my friend if he made this transaction or not. my friend answers no, and it is declined. 

* my friend, freaked out by the notification, checks his bank, and sees a statement showing $1000 was withdrawn a couple days ago.

* my friend immediately calls chase, telling them he did not make any of those transactions and that his cards need to be cancelled because his account is compromised. they ask for his address (we live in texas) and then tell him the charges will be reversed.

* a few days later, my friend checks his account and sees that the charges were reversed only temporarily, and he ended up still having the charges.

* my friend checks his email again which has since been filled with spam and there was a request the day *before* he got the original alert for a new card. he changed the password and added 2fa so as to secure the email. my friend also checked the locations where his email was signed into and there was one in florida.

* my friend waits an additional 2 weeks believing that the issue is already resolved since he called the bank and let them know those transactions weren't him as well as requesting a card to his address which they asked him for. 

* he never got a card, so he goes to a local branch and is told that the new card was sent to florida to the thief.

since then my friend has tried contacting chase over the phone multiple times and they have been extremely reluctant to help, and have asked him for proof that he was in texas on the day of the transactions. they also gave him a deadline of 2 weeks before they will close the case and refuse to help.

my question is this: what can my friend do now? i'm starting to help him out, got a letter from his campus that he was at school that day, and i was planning on going with him to the local branch so we could set this straight.

"i bought a house with my ex. we weren't broken up at the time. we had been together for years and were getting married the following summer...until he cheated. since we had the house over our heads, we tried to work it out, and i supported him through some really rough months. he then decided he wasn't in love with me and didn't know if he ever was. we are only a couple of years into owning the house and have built up pretty much zero equity. i realize that i made a ton of mistakes, but i am trying to get through this with the least amount of pain.

here's the problem: he's still on the mortgage, and i have no idea what to do. i looked into refinancing, but rates are higher than when we bought. with fees and interest,it would add $30,000 on to what i'm paying. i looked into assuming the loan, which i did qualify for, but they are charging $11,000 in fees, which i do not have. i contacted a realtor about selling the house, which i absolutely do not want to do (i have put an immense amount of work into the upkeep of the house after a few issues came up), but they said that i would lose a ton of money at this point (around $20,000). as far as renting goes, i do not have the finances available to get it into rental quality. i also have a job that prevent me from having the time or money to deal with having renters.

i'm feeling pretty trapped. i don't really have the money to stay or go, and my ex is not helpful in this situation at all. he does not have any money or effort to contribute. i'm hoping someone out there can spot a way that i can get through this somewhat intact.

"$65k stolen from my parents' bank account at wells fargo. supposedly this happened a few times this week, and the guy doing it knows what he is doing and hasn't been caught. 

the guy somehow got a hold of my dad's social security number, as well as account # and routing # at wf. he then masks his ip address through a vpn and sets up a new bank account at bank #2 (using social security # and personal details). he then uses the routing # and account # to transfer $65,990 out of wf to bank #2, then pulls all the funds out (i don't know how you pull it out without showing your face unless you transfer it again) and then closes the account. 

originally i thought this might have been an inside job with wf all over the news lately, but the police confirmed this same thing is happening frequently to many people. 

good news is, wells fargo is replacing all of the stolen funds...

it's classic personal finance advice to say buy a reliable used car over a new one if you want to make a wise investment. new cars plummet in value as soon as you pull off the lot.

"over 50% of millenials have less than $1,000 saved.. according to a google consumer survey, over 50% of millenials have less than $1,000 in savings.

http://howmuch.net/articles/how-much-millennials-have-saved-up

the article has several nice graphics an includes the following breakdown:

* 51.8% of millenials have less than $1,000 in savings.

* 18% have $1,000 - $5,000 in savings.

* 7.3% have $5,000 - $10,000 in savings.

* 6.4% have $10,000 - $20,000 in savings.

* 16.5% of millenials have more than $20,000 in savings.

there's further breakdowns by income group and gender.

this seems consistent with other surveys that indicate americans don't save well, and for this particular age group the great recession probably has a lot to do with it.  the breakdown by gender was interesting to me - i wonder if it's an indication that wage inequality is not improving with the younger generation.  i was also quite surprised at the distribution by age group - i expected a successively smaller percentage of those surveyed to have more in savings, with the smallest percentage being for the ""over $20,000"" category, which is not the case.

the survey methodology is here(https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=sw3gyf6eo4s3k&question=1&filter=inc%3a%2425%2c000-%2449%2c999&rw=1) and the article asserts:

"28 years old with a degree in english, making $30,000/year in southern california. i have no idea what to do with my life, but i'm terrified of the future.. title says it all. i'm currently working as a legal assistant at a small legal services company for $15/ho. i've essentially plateaued there and have been searching for new positions elsewhere. i'm currently in-line for a job making $20/ho at a loan company, but there's no guarantee that i got it. even if i do, it's only one small step forward.

cost of living here is very high, and as such, i'm still living at home. i save about $1,000 to $1,500 a month, and currently have $10,500 in the bank. my goal is to be able to save enough for a down payment on a home within the next 2-3 years. i have excellent credit, with a current score of 788.

i have several paths from here i can take. military and law enforcement are constants, but both have pretty big negatives. military would remove me from my home and my family, and law enforcement is difficult to get into, especially with five traffic tickets on my record in the last few years.

going back to school is another big step i want to take, but there are so many options, with so few ways to know which will pay off the best. i have a ba in english from the cal state university program, which is largely useless, and it's preventing me from being able to go back into a bachelor's program. as such, i would need to either get into a trade school or an aa program. i've considered paralegal, computer science, and business, while leaning pretty heavily towards computer science.

i also intend to start making use of khan academy and other free resources to build a knowledge database for business and programming, but have no idea how applicable my accomplishments with those programs will be for getting a job.

please offer me any advice, big or small. i welcome all of it. feeling like i've wasted my life up to now and have no idea where to go.

update: sorry for the late update, but thanks to a lot of the advice and encouragement that came out of this thread, i'm now employed as a legal assistant and technical writer for a growing mortgage firm in south orange county, ca. i make about 33% more than i did at my previous job, and i'm staying at home while i continue to save every penny i can to buy a house in the next year-and-a-half or so. i'm also considering moving out of state when that time comes.

i can't thank you guys enough. i was on the verge of tears when i made that thread, and i'm starting to feel my feet stabilize a bit under me. still a long road to go, and i need to be smarter and less complacent than i was in the six years i stagnated at my last company, but i've got a fire in my belly i haven't had before. it's a good feeling.

i put the email through google translate and it churned out perfect english (no misspellings) and informed me that my request to transfer $500.00 from my bank account to my paypal balance was processing and that the funds would be available on monday. when i went to log in to my account, my password didn't work so i reset it and i did indeed see the -500.00 transfer in my account, so the email was legit.

paypal was closed when this happened but i called my bank to alert them of the fraud.

i called paypal this morning and when i went to log in to my account again, they'd changed my password *again* overnight. i went through and changed all my passwords everywhere and paypal sent me a secure reset password thing and locked down my account. 

turns out, someone gained access to my email and sat on my paypal account for a month and tried to slip this in on the sly. paypal said that they send the email in spanish because most people will assume that it is spam and not realize it's a legitimate paypal email. once the money is available, they transfer it to their own account. she said i was fortunate to catch it before it got to that point because they're able to cancel the transaction. super creepy knowing someone was watching all my uber transactions for a month.

anyway, i had never heard of this particular scam so i hope my story helps someone else! if you see an email from paypal in spanish or another language, double-triple check it!

"a reminder that nobody knows where the market is going, and trying to time the market is a fool's game. this is in response to a comment that was made exactly one year ago by /u/alienm00se:

https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3pro4r/goodbye_middle_class_51_percent_of_all_american/cw90j8y/

he speculated that the market is headed for a crash, and it was a good idea to sell out of large caps over the next year and start investing in hedge positions to shield against the crash. he also speculated that gold is going to possibly drop to $850/ounce, and it would be a good buy when it drops below $1050. i set a reminder to see where we are a year later.

well, guess what happened? no surprise here. 

the closing price of the s&p 500 on 10/21/2015 was ~~$2018~~ $2052. 

the closing price on 10/21/2016 was $2141.

the s&p 500 is actually up ~~6%~~ 4.3% even after the tumultuous roller coaster ride we've had this year. certainly, ~~6%~~ 4.3% pales in comparison to the raging bull market we've had where we've seen it soar 20% in one year. however, it is still a decent return. periodically selling off during the past year would have resulted in missing out on those gains as well as possibly locking in some losses since we had a few months where the market fell and then rebounded.

gold did not go below $1050 once all year. the lowest it was all year was exactly $1050.80 on dec 17, 2015.(http://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html) today it is $1266. that being said, i still do not recommend gold as an investment(http://www.aaii.com/files/images/articles/9298-figure-1.jpg).

the most prudent advice is, as warren buffett recommends, invest in low-cost index funds, and invest long term.(http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/08/10/why-warren-buffett-thinks-putting-your-money-her-2.aspx)

your buddy who's got a hot stock pick? forget it. some conspiracy theorist on reddit says the market is overvalued and headed for a crash? not a chance. buy index, hold long, don't try to time the market.

* property taxes are ballpark $800/year for my preferred ""range"" of houses
* rent (altogether in my area) runs from around $900-1200
* that is, a $800 mortgage would be a fairly nice house whereas a $900 rental would be a small apartment or a sketchy neighborhood. i'm willing to spend about $700-900/mo on either rent or mortgage.
* if i were to buy a house, the expenses (barring buying furniture, things breaking, emergencies, etc.) would be equal to or slightly higher than just renting an apartment.
* i have no credit. i've heard that no credit is better than bad credit, but, i've heard that in my area most landlords/realtors will take a decent job and clean record as a ""replacement"" unless you're after an immaculate place which i'm not.
* i don't plan on moving out of the area at all within the next five years, *maybe* within the next 10 years, and likely will after 10-15 years. in my area, you can break even or slightly profit on a house after 5 years, and almost certainly will within 10 years.
* i plan on smoking trees, so, i'd prefer a house for this reason. medical state and i have a card, but i don't know that neighbors/landlords would respect that. even if they do tolerate it, i don't wanna be *that guy*.
* however, i enjoy the non-commitment of an apartment. i.e, if i don't like the neighbors or landlord, i can rent someplace else or choose to buy.
* i enjoy the concept of being able to renovate and ""improve"" a house however i like.",10
"don't be afraid of the word ""bond."" it's just a loan, backwards.. i've noticed that a lot of people hear the word ""bond"" and recoil. but a bond is just a loan, backwards.

when a bank issues you a loan, you borrow money from them. later, if everything goes well, you pay them back. also, you have to pay them some interest - because it was nice of them to let you borrow their money, and they weren't sure you would pay it back.

when a bank issues a ""bond,"" you pay them money to buy it. and then later, you can cash it in for more money.

conceptually, the bank is just borrowing money from you. they take money from you, and then later, they give you the money back, plus some more money.

the word ""bond"" literally is just a loan, where you are the lender, and they are the borrower.

final note - i've said banks here, but governments and private businesses also issue bonds. it's just what large bodies say when they want to borrow money.",10
"the door of student debt. the door: http://imgur.com/gallery/nwhqt

my wife and i paid off a large chunk of our student loans last month ($8,000). the problem was it didn't really seem satisfying, it was just money out of our account.  
similar to pulling rings when counting down the days until christmas; we decided to put 1k squares covering a closet door. every time we pay 1k off our loans we pull down a square.  
certain squares have goals on them. these are things we can do once we pull the square off the wall.

i think having a visual like this will really motivate us to get this debt paid off sooner rather than later.

"dad (53) died a year ago and mom (58) is unemployed and spent all her savings. we are in massachusetts though i'm not sure what other information i should be including here. but i'm asking for advice on what i can do to help in this situation. 

she was a stay at home mom and only has a high school diploma. she has off and on part time job experience but nothing full time within the last 20 years. 

she's frantically searching for a job and even has an interview as an office assistant next week but is freaking out that she can't pay the july bills. 

i moved back in with her and am starting a funded phd position in september at which point i can contribute more directly to the finances. i'm working now but not making enough to contribute much more than paying the water bill or her phone bill every month.

i guess i'm here to ask people more experienced than me what we can do to make sure my mom can live at least comfortably from now on.

edit: some more information that seems pertinent is that 

1. she owns the house
2. she knows she needs to work but is more worried about building up a retirement account 
3. i will be contributing around 500 a month

"$2000 worth of unauthorized charges on stamps.com and the claim they cannot correct it. learn from our mistakes.. so this weekend my wife checked our bank account and found we had $2000 worth of charges from stamps.com that we did not make. ~~two years ago~~ a few months ago she signed up for their service for some shipping but found it cheaper to use the post office. well sometime friday night someone got into her account (using an old password she hasn't used in years) and ordered $2000 worth of labels in increasing amounts. first $30, then $110 then $300 and so on and so on. since stamps.com doesn't have any after hours support or anyone on site with the holiday yesterday, they claim there is nothing they can do and all the labels/postage have been printed. 

we called our bank, disputed the charges, had the card replaced and now we have to wait up to 10 days to get the $2000 back to our account.

while on the phone the rep lectured my wife about proper password safety and actually  said ""if you watched the news you'd know this is a problem"". wifey says it sounds like the rep was reading from a script so this is likely not an isolated issue. while doing some quick googling this weekend we found more than a few people reporting the same issue this week. seems like this was a coordinated effort to coincide with the holiday to limit people's ability to fight it.

so, learn from our mistakes. 

1) never reuse passwords. ever. the last few months we have been diligent about this, but we created this account a few years ago and forgotten about it. 

2) don't use your debit card for online purchases. use a credit card because while you fight unauthorized charges you're not eating ramen for 4 days while you sort it out. 

3) do research on businesses before working with them. stamps.com has a less than stellar reputation for being proactive about dealing with fraud.

"being very poor for 9 months has given me incredible perspective on things.. the past year was really, really tough. i think i made something like $7,000 last year. and i pay rent, and eat, and have a phone bill. i don't live at mom and dads. i'm 27.

honestly, i sponged more than i would have liked a lot. even living an incredibly miserly life doesn't cut it when you're earning virtually nothing. but i have a huge amount of personal pride when it comes to borrowing money and i never allowed that to get ridiculous. the sum total of money borrowed is about $750 from various friends. i achieved this by basically doing nothing ever, and eating chicken soup 7 days a week. the weight of this debt was absolutely crushing me. the embarrassment of not being able to buy my own beer and having my friends check up on me all the time was just too much.

they were really sympathetic, but they just don't understand the level of poorness. they don't understand what it means to be so broke that it's actually amusing that a monthly bank fee can destroy your plans of eating for the next 2 days. i mean, we're not students anymore. they've all got careers or at least well paying full-time employment. being poor to them means not going out on both friday *and* saturday. so they invite you over (""don't worry, we'll supply the beer"") but meanwhile you're having a panic attack because what if one calls you and asks you to grab a couple of lemons? they've never even considered that buying a lemon might be a supremely luxurious way to waste 50% of all the money you have in the world. wait, can i even justify the bus fare? maybe i could do the 2-hour walk and just apologize for turning up 2 hours late?

those are the friends who were really great though. understandably, i pissed off some people along the way. i lost a friend who was a former housemate (he kicked me out). my current housemate had late rent delivered to him, and he was more than good about it. but he was still pissed off. my brother was sometimes covering my phone bill, and he has a young child and a single income. i felt fucking awful, and like i couldn't do anything about it. 

so picture my lifestyle. i've set up the cheapest possible way of living - almost no money coming in, but very little going out. tiny room, growing apart from friends all the time, becoming more depressed every day. i had completely forgotten what financial independence meant. and every day i had the fear of not knowing what the hell i would do when my already dying phone were to break, or my clothes all to wear out, or an unexpected bill to roll in.

anyway, a fortnight ago i got a new job. a proper career job. i went from $7k (""salary"") to $58k salary.  they love me there, and i love the job. last friday the first paycheck rolled in. i got square with my rent, i paid back nearly all of my debts. i went out with my friends and bought *them* their drinks. 

and now i have enough to live on for the next fortnight without being a total hermit. and after that i will be completely fine.

it's difficult to explain just how relieving that is. to think that i will have more money coming in in 2 weeks than i have seen in my bank account for nearly a year. 

so now i don't take it for granted. just because i *can* go out and buy breakfast for $60 doesn't mean i will. this is something i used to do when i had a job and no sense of responsibility. but i never want to be in the position again of being mortally afraid of what would happen if i get so much as an an unexpected $100 bill. 

anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest. i love this sub and read it every day. until recently i felt powerless to take any advice from it though.

edit: holy crap, typed this up on a throwaway account, went for a beer. came back drunk to lots of karma and comments. thanks guys!

edit 2: a lot of people are asking how i managed to survive on $7k, and how i managed to go from $7k to $58k so suddenly. 

part of the explanation for that is i guestimated the american dollars. i'm in australia. i think the money i made last year was actually $12k in australian money, but i tried to adjust for cost of living. i'm earning $58k australian. it's a good entry level salary for an industry that i have a couple of years experience in.

why did i go for so long on such a small amount of money? complicated situation where i was working with a (now former) friend and taking a director role. i was trying to make a business succeed that had failed a year before and i just didn't realise it. i was working a lot of hours, hoping that we would make that one or two big deals to change our pathetic lives into million dollar dreams. i learned a lot of lessons. sure, i could have got a grocery job, but i wanted to make it happen. 

so i was already quite well experienced for this industry, i just went from self-employment to working a 9-5.",10
"i got scammed out of $800 and i've never felt more stupid.. a guy ran into me outside the bank claiming to be a college student needing to pay his student debt. he said he had a paycheck from work that he couldn't cash since his account his bank account was negative. he showed me his phone and confirmed his account was negative and it was a student account. 

he needed to explain his story multiple times because i wasn't sure what he wanted from me so i didn't really understand. the guy showed me he couldn't get into his account at the bank atm, although he was using an atm card, the kind of card they give you temporarily while they mail you your new debit card.

he had a whole story lined up, like where he works, where he went to school and what he majored in. he even gave me a phone number to call him if anything went wrong afterwards.

what he wanted from me was for me to cash his money order using my account and have me withdraw the money. i realize how obvious of a scam this sounds but i have really bad anxiety and i wasn't thinking straight, i just wanted him to leave me alone because he kept pressing me.

i deposited the money order and gave him the money. we talked a bit afterwards and then parted ways. a few hours later i got a message from the bank that said they couldn't accept the money order.

i tried calling him but he didn't answer. judging from the voicemail, the number was from a texting/calling app. i know he can at least read my texts because he responded to my threats about contacting the police(although i already had and they can't do anything.) all he said in the message was his first name he told me when we met.

i feel so stupid because i knew better but i let my anxiety get the better of me. i don't feel like i've learned anything because it was such an obvious scam, i just needed to be assertive and tell him to fuck off but i'm not an assertive kinda guy so it's hard.

i doubt the bank can do anything because it was 100% my fault so i doubt they would just give me the money back. it just sucks because i'm a college student who doesn't have much money and i will need that $800.

sorry if this doesn't fit the subreddit, i didn't know where else to post.

"disabled 29 y/o, heating bills out of control and rising. not sure what to do.. hello! 

a little about me: i'm 29 and was diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder in my late teens. i was raised in a traditional ethnic community where women weren't encouraged to handle money; so i've spent the last two years essentially teaching myself to manage my finances while living independently for the first time. so far, things have been going ... okay. i've never been late on my bills and nothing has ever been shut off; but i could definitely serve to budget a bit better. money is extremely tight, though. 

i only get $750/mo and my rent alone is $425. i currently rent the lower half of a historic home on the outskirts of a major city.there's an apartment above me; but it's only been occupied since november. since then, my heating bills have been going up steadily. 

i had the gas&electric company come out to check the meter; but they said it was working fine after being replaced in april. next, my landlord sent out their hvac guy to check on the heater; but he said it was working fine. the only thing he found was that upstairs's hot water was going through my meter, so they agreed to pay 1/5th of my gas bill to cover it. he also told me to keep my heat on and set low instead of turning it off and on like i had been. 

for the past month, i've done what he said and kept my home heated around 60 degrees. it's been really bad and i'm always cold -- and in pain since the chill hurts my back and joints horribly. but i needed to save money, so i didn't give into the temptation to turn it up higher. 

i got my bill last night and it's worse than ever. it's almost $200, just in gas. i'm not sure what to do or where to go from here. i'm including a graph to show exactly how high it's jumped. 

any advice would be deeply, deeply appreciated. i cried myself to sleep about this last night because i'm so deeply worried. this feels like the first big financial crisis i've had since i've been independent and i don't know what to do next. it feels like i've exhausted my options and no one is listening. 

thank you for any help you guys throw my way.

update -- 
thank you so, so much for all the help, pf! you guys an incredible. 

after reading through the thread, i spoke with my upstairs neighbor. we're in complete agreement that the landlord needs to come out here and weatherproof the house -- as well as getting the upstairs apartment's hot water on their own meter. we wrote a joint letter together and sent it off to our property management; so we should hear back soon! 

in the meantime, i'm going to try to seal the windows myself since the house is horribly drafty. 

i also called the gas company out today to investigate the place i was smelling gas; but they determined it was just a normal little bit that gets let off when my upstairs neighbor turns on his stove. they said it was safe; so i'm going to trust them. 

thank you to the multiple wonderful people who offered to get me heated blankets or food. that's very kind of you all and far too generous. lgbtqa+ shelters could use that kindness far more than me; especially during this time of year where a lot of teens end up on the street, cold and abandoned.
here's a way of finding some in your area, if you want to help!: https://www.lgbtcenters.org/lgbtcenters

and thank you again for all your help so far. i'm reading every comment and taking all the advice to heart. it means a lot to mean. i'll update you guys when i find out more!

second update -- 

i have yet to hear back from my landlord; but it usually takes them a few days to get in touch with the owners, so i'm not worried yet. i really cannot properly express just how much this thread has helped me. i'm still new to living on my own, managing my finances, and managing a household, in general. usually, i feel two steps behind everybody on this stuff and never feel like i know the right questions to ask. i can honestly say that, going forward, i know exactly what to say to my landlord and anyone he sends out. thank you for that, from the bottom of my heart.  

also, i wanted to let you guys know that the energy bill this month is entirely paid off thanks to the amazing generosity of some absolutely remarkable people. i also have a few other things headed my way to help me fend off the cold a bit better. i'm just astounded by the kindness in this community. but again, there's other people out there who need your help way, way more than i do -- so, please, if you have the means, consider donating to an lgbtqa+ shelter in your area. it makes more of a difference than you could ever know.

"homeless at 18. yesterday my mom kicked me out.

we've had a poor relationship for most of my life, and she feels that whenever something good happens to her i ruin it in some way. for the past year leading up to this i've rarely been in the house, just as a way to try and avoid the constant conflict. i've been in therapy for some time and it's taken this year to realize that the way she treats me is ""abusive,"" and my constant paranoia in my own home was not normal.  while i was packing my things yesterday she said many hurtful things, telling me i'll 'never amount to anything', she 'never wanted me', and i'm 'the most selfish and dramatic person she's ever met'.

before this happened, i've felt i have a lot of things going for me. i'm currently in university, an honours program i'm going into my second year with. i worked a well paying job as a pharmacy technician in high school that allowed me to buy my own car in full, now only needing to worry about insurance. currently, i am working a casual part-time retail job, a decision i had made to lessen stress so i could focus on studies. come september i will be commuting to school once again (45 minute drive away) and presumably my hours at my job will go down.

right now my boyfriend's family has taken me in, so i have somewhere to sleep. however, i worry about becoming a nuisance in some way like i was to my own parents. i have another 3 years of university to get through, so i will need to find my own place at some point.

my biggest fear right now is that i'm going to lose everything. i have an education plan, a job (albeit, not anything special), and a car, but how can i keep this up with costs? especially considering the eventual need to find my own place to live.

"pretty sure my friend is being scammed. here is the story he told me. plenty of red flags but i'm interested if anyone has any experience with a similar situation.

so essentially a few months ago my friend purchased a 5 year anti virus/computer protection service from a company called ""yale vision"". i googled around and can not seem to find this company first of all. my friend goes ahead and pays $400 (wtf who pays $400 for antivirus??) for 5 years of service.

fast forward to yesterday, few months after purchase, someone supposedly from the company calls my friend and explains that they are going out of business and he is owed a refund. so after a long drawn out process, the rep transfers the refund to my friends bank account. he was supposed to get $400 and he realizes the rep sent him $4000. 

so my friend goes ""hey man you sent me 4000 not 400"". cue the rep freaking out, getting management on the line, freaking out. they go on to ask him to go to the nearest walmart and transfer them the money right now to avoid any delays because they need their money back.

my friend, thinking he just hit community chest in monopoly, essentially tells them to kick rocks and hangs up. they call back, he doesn't answer and goes on to block them. 

he is pretty convinced that it was some sort of error on their part and this money is his now.

to me, this sounds like one of the fake check scams where you end up over drawing your account and getting robbed but i don't know. 

did my friend just make a $4000 come up or is he as gullible as i think he is? if the company did make a mistake, can he legally keep the money? is he going to be taken to court if the firm did make an error like that?


**edit: did not expect this to blow up the way it did. i told him from the jump this is a major scam and i really appreciate everyone bringing to light some of the potential threats i did not consider. 

i made this post for my friend to see to hopefully convince him to take action. i believe it has to an extent, he will be going to his bank today. i will keep the post updated. ",10
"beware of ""just launched"" 3rd party seller bots on amazon.com.. for example: https://imgur.com/a/ut4bi

these bots severely undercut the market rate for the product in hopes of luring in consumers. after the consumer's purchase, they send a fake tracking code and collect their money while you're out of your money and the product. i'm not sure what amazon usually does once alerted to this scam post-purchase, but users on /r/amazon report mixed responses, where they're sometimes helped and sometimes not (see thread below). the bots propagate almost immediately after they're reported to customer service (i did so for the example above and another bot popped up immediately thereafter). users on /r/amazon report these bots are from china. 

the safest bet to ordering products on amazon is to buy from amazon itself, verified sellers, or sellers with multiple ratings. just beware of these scams.

"my credit card was mistakenly charged $41,080 instead of $41.80 when paying utilities, what can i do?. the utilities company made a mistake and added a 0 instead of a . when charging my credit card. for some reason the cc company didn't find anything wrong with a utilities charge of $41,000 even though my credit limit is less than that, and let the charge go through. now both companies are blaming the other and saying they can't do anything about it. utilities company is telling me to file a dispute with my cc provider, they're saying they can't take the charge off. eventually the utilities company sent me a form that's not even meant for this type of issue, so i don't know if filling it out will even do anything. what are my options if this form doesn't get the issue resolved? it's already been a few weeks.

edit: wow this really blew up, thanks for all of the helpful responses. i originally posted this for my dad thinking i'd get 2 or 3 replies. since this is getting so much attention i thought i'd make some clarifications.

the credit card is southwest airlines rapid rewards. credit limit is around $30,000. my dad received a confirmation email from the utilities company but never a call or any confirmation from the cc company. he said he clicked to pay the full amount of 41.84, then when submitting he got an error and checked his email and saw the confirmation show up. when he went back to the page he saw that it was complete so didn't think any more about it.

i think it's possible he hit 41084 instead of 41.84 by accident, but the charge should never have gone through. it was above his credit limit, he pays roughly the same amount every month, it was for a single home utilities...

my dad had to call the cc and utilities company back and forth like 5 times before the cc company finally sent him a dispute form (i mistakenly thought that it was the utilities company earlier). however, this form is a general ""credit not processed"" form with no really relevant questions to what's going on. this was sent back in a few days ago and still waiting to see what will come of it. others have mentioned regz, i don't think my dad brought it up so i don't know if that would have made a difference in how they handled it.

anyway here's the conf email and dispute form, i couldn't help but laugh when seeing how ridiculous the number is.  http://imgur.com/i4je790",10
"what being ""pre-approved"" actually means. hello friends! in case you don't know, i currently work at a credit repair company and i just want to spread a piece of information that i think more people need to know:

if you get an email/phone call/ text/ letter from some kind of company (it could be a car company, a loan company, credit car company doesn't matter) saying that you've been ""pre-approved"" that literally means nothing. it's purely just them using a good marketing tactic.

the literal meaning of ""pre-approved"" is ""at a stage before approval"". which is the stupidest thing ever because anyone could be pre-approved for anything. technically i am pre-approved to be the president of the united states. 

""pre-approved"" is a meaningless statement in the credit world, meant to lure people into applying for things. which if you have bad credit, applying and getting denied for things just makes it worse. don't fall for it.


edit: hey guys, so i've got a lot of people telling me how wrong i am, which is fine. the thing is is that yes, some companies will actually pre-approve you in the sense that you are guaranteed to receive whatever it is you're applying for. i would like to emphasize though that that is not the vast majority of cases.

you can just google pre-approval and come up with the same thing i just told you.

the thing that i want for you all to take away from this is do your research. get informed, know what you're applying for. read the fine print. ignorance is how people get their credit screwed up, don't let that happen to you.

"i'm 18 and have 4 months to find a better job, get a car, enroll in college, and find an apartment. im so lost. ok where do i start...

alright, a little about me: i'm an 18 african-american female brought up in an abusive family. i went snooping through my father's email and found a 'friendly' eviction draft dated for september 2017. like.. holy fuck this is really happening and i have to get out. i only have a debit card and i don't have a credit card or any debt/loans. i thought i had savings bonds, but my father cashed them before i turned 18. 

i currently work retail and make $9hr. i try to get scheduled for 30-32 hours every week but they will not give me more. i've tried applying to call centers but i have a heavy lisp and i believe this is causing me to fail interviews. i don't know what else pays higher than $9hr for highschool graduates. i don't have my associates (yet).

i need to enroll in community college. i tried applying to my local college online? but i'm not sure if i have classes or not as i haven't received an acceptance email. the application also asked for two $25 fees but it didn't give me an option to pay for it after i put in my fafsa information. i'm so confused i think i got rejected because my 2.4gpa is too low, it really sucks because i wanted to take some of their art classes as i've been told my art is decent(http://orig07.deviantart.net/090a/f/2017/107/7/7/together_by_rouzani-db67snx.png). i don't have a phone because i'm trying to save money otherwise i would call. i don't know what to do. 

i don't know how much i'm getting from the fafsa. is the pell grant a monthly thing? these were the results of my application:

> based on your efc of 000000, you may be eligible to receive a federal pell grant of up to $5,920 for the 2017-2018 school year provided you have not met or exceeded the lifetime limit established for the federal pell grant program.


i don't have my license or permit and i need to purchase a car so i can have transportation. i looked on craigslist and they're cheaper than the dealership but everyone keeps telling me to not do it? there are some cars for $800-$2400 and i can buy it right now and have that part done. your sidebar recommends saving up $5000 for a good car but i don't know why when there are cheaper cars? is there something i'm missing?

i don't know how to get an apartment. part of my father's letter states i must take my pets with me, so i'll also have 3 small housetrained pets. will this hurt the lease? can i setup a direct deposit with the apartment's landlord so i can pay my bill on time?

thank you.

**edit 5/1 11:29** thank you! i didn't expect to get so much advice and guidance! i have to work in a few hours, but i'm currently going through and writing a pro/con list. i've also applied to about 5 jobs since last night and plan on doing more after work. i won't join the military/air force on a whim but its certainly something i'm considering. i'll talk with a recruiter.

"parents claimed me on their taxes but don't pay for anything, what should i do?. so my parents claimed me as dependent on their taxes so that they could get the benefits. the problem is, i pay for my rent and i take out my own loans for college because they don't help me out at all. i think this might be causing me issues getting money from the fafsa as well, because the government thinks my parents pay for over half of my income, when in reality they don't.

use hours worked rather then item cost when making large purchases decisions. when it comes to buying stuff i want rather then need. i started comparing the item cost to my salary when deciding if it was worth it. so for example a brand new tv would be 50 hours of work rather then $x. i find that makes it easier to decide if i should buy something new or stick with what i have. please tell me i'm not the only one.,10
"should i leave the job i love for more money?. i really love my job. i love what i do. i believe it has meaning. my coworkers are mostly awesome. our ""clients"" are awesome. i've gotten 3 promotions in 6 years and doubled my salary. i have a young child at home and they are understanding of the demands on my time. my office is 20 minutes away from my home. i have it good.

that said - i'm kinda underpaid. i recently got an offer to make 20% more. we don't need the money to survive but it would mean paying off debt and being home owners a little sooner which would be nice.

i'm torn. i'm nervous i won't like the new job and new coworkers as much. i'm nervous they will be less flexible and i would have to sacrifice my family time more often. there is opportunity for more money and more experience but is that worth it?

if anyone has made a similar decision i'd love to hear how it turned out. would love to hear from anyone but especially working mothers.

**update** 

wow, thank you all for the advice. i've read and thought carefully about what each of you said. i think i didn't realize that 20% is not that substantial. i've taken a large pay cut before for my happiness which is how i ended up at my current job in the first place. since then, i've gotten married and had a child and i guess i felt a certain obligation to earn as much as possible. but i agree with those saying 20% is not worth the uncertainties.

i'm still going to go to the second interview just to see if i really hit it off with the people or they have some kind of amazing work-from-home option that would significantly increase my quality of life but outside of these two things the 20% increase alone is not enough to take the job. (it was offered unofficially pending a second interview that they said was a ""formality"".)

**mini update**

i'm continuing to read your responses and i will still take the second interview with more of an eye at interviewing them. i'm curious how many of you that say you would take the risk have a young child at home?

also, i would never use this offer to leverage a raise at my current place. i believe this is a great environment because people love the mission and are generally the type to forgo a little extra money for the sake of fulfillment. it's competitive to work here but not because of the money. i feel that kind of move would be frowned upon.",10
"t-mobile charged me $1600 dollars... but has no record of it? help please. i'm not positive that this is the right sub to ask, so if it's not i'll post it somewhere else.

okay, so here's the deal. on sunday (9/16) i called t-mobile to sign up for a plan a purchase a phone. gave them my information, things were going along just fine, and then there was a snafu when they tried to process my payment. the rep tried a few times, and it still wasn't going through. we eventually figured out that bank of america had flagged it for potential fraud and i had to manually approve it to get it to go through. i did, but the t-mobile rep said they still had not been able to process my payment. 

except... the money was charged on my end. three times. 

the first one was automatically reversed by the bank, since it was flagged as potential fraud (as i understand it, i don't actually know if that's how it worked). the other two charges (798.84 each) have been in processing limbo since sunday. bank of america says they can't do anything until the charges post, and t-mobile has been giving me the run around since sunday night. i can't exactly blame the reps themselves for not knowing what to do, since the processing snafu on their end resulted in zero record  of the transaction. a t-mobile account was not created for me and no order has been processed. what i am irate about is that the t-mobile reps keep proposing solutions and then there is no follow up. 

wednesday they were supposed to send an email to both me and my bank detailing the situation, and they haven't.

today i got a hold of a supervisor who was supposed to investigate the situation and then call me back at 2:30. guess what didn't happen. 

i've now currently been on hold for an hour and a half with the financial department, and i have no idea what avenues are left for me to pursue. 

since the $1600 is still ""processing"" it hasn't left my account, but... it's not available to me, right? how do i get this resolved? i'll answer any questions to explain the situation more, but i'm starting to get seriously stressed about this. 

edit: my main concern is that this payment should not be taking 5 days to process, right? if i should give it more time to resolve itself i will, but at what point am i actually supposed to worry?

"i used to work at a bank and came across this scam that job seekers should be aware of.. i used to be a banker in a retail branch at a large american bank. every once in a while we would get a customers that would find a job online (craigslist, ect) and get completely screwed over. i've made it easy by premising this as being a scam. try to put yourself in the unknowing victims shoes. 

&nbsp;

example job posting: 

*need reliable, intelligent operations coordinator / event steward. our venue is a small friendly environment looking for an organized, outgoing, motivated individual with a flexible schedule to work events & some evenings and weekends will be required. you must have reliable transportation and a current driver's license, as some office errands will be required.* 

*job responsibilities will include:* 

•	*tear down & set up event space (may include stripping the room of all furniture, vacuuming & resetting the room).*

•	*maintain high standards of cleanliness & sanitation throughout the event function space which includes carpets, walls, walkway, tables, chairs, linen, etc.).*

•	*during events, duties may include assisting with refreshing the coffee, tea, water & attending to different needs.*

•	*packaging orders to ship & logging in receivables, locating orders, putting up inventory, ordering shipping supplies.*

•	*staying on track with ups orders for pickup & receiving.*

•	*light office work.*

&nbsp;

you are running out of money and desperate for some work, so you apply because it seems legitimate enough. plus, how can this be a scam? you send an email with your resume and lucky enough for you they respond. they say you sound like the perfect candidate and they have an upcoming event they need you to coordinate (they may even call you to make sure **you** are who you say you are). they mail you the event details and a $5,000 check. they say they need you to deposit this check and buy yourself a laptop or a desk or whatever you need to ensure you are prepared for the upcoming event and mail $3,000 of it to the event speaker. they say they need to make sure they can trust you and if you do this right, they'll continue to give you more work. you do this because after all they are giving you money, there is no risk to you.

this is where it all goes wrong.

you feel a bit uncertain but you deposit the check and wait about a week to make sure it clears. a few days after depositing it, you see the money is in your account. ok, it may be legit. you send the money to the event speaker via western union or whatever instruction your new boss have given you. a few more days later you're account is (negative) -$3,000. the reason is because this check was drawn off of a tiny bank in a tiny town. the amount of time to verify this check was longer than the amount of time that the funds are made available in your account. the reason for this is  because checks need to be verified from both banks. this can be difficult to do because of many factors (in this case it's a tiny bank that is difficult to get in contact with their clearing department) and large banks have their own fund availability policies. banks may choose to make funds available earlier to reduce the negative impact to customers. they are also restricted to how long they can hold funds due to the expedited funds availability act: regulation cc. 

tl;dr: you can deposit a check in your account and have it clear then have the money pulled out of your account days later because of how check clearing works. ",10

then my so and i got together with the person they met and their so, and we talked again, at a coffee shop. they wanted to know our mindset on financial independence and wanted to offer to mentor us to help us reach our goals and help us change our mindset to go bigger with finances. 

no product was ever pushed, no company was ever mentioned. this just sounds like a mlm, but there is no product that we've been made aware of. and i really don't get the scam artist vibe - they don't want our bank accounts.

they talked about books like rich dad/poor dad, the go-getter, and other financially minded books.

is this something anyone is aware of? are these people just living out the principles of mentorship as described in the books they're talking about, or is there something else going on that i am oblivious to?

"i have never had a credit card because i wanted to establish healthy financial practices first. i checked my credit after filing my taxes this year and have 30k in credit card debt due to my mother opening cards in my name. what should i do?. please refer to updates.  updated situation title is no longer accurate.


it turns out i am an authorized user in regards to her bad credit.  i owe a lot less than 30k now if i am removed.

i'm sorry if this is a bit long or unclear, this is my first time posting here and i'm not sure where else to go or what to do.

i am a 22 year old national guard soldier trying to get back into the local university.  i just got back from years of training and am trying to i'm to readjust to being a civilian again.  i am working part time in addition to regular monthly drills and don't make a lot.  i also don't spend a lot and have been putting most of what i make into savings.  filing taxes was fairly easy and turbotax allowed me to check my credit score as i had filed with them.  

i haven't really tackled credit whatsoever before this as i had been an incredibly impulsive person before the military and worried that i'd go out of control with credit.  so i didn't touch it and instead developed a healthy habit of saving and budgeting before even considering getting a credit card.  i know i was stupid to not regularly check it earlier, but i thought the second best time was to do it now.

turns out my credit score is dismally low as there is more than 30,000 dollars of debt in my name which is more than triple of what i have saved up over years.  my mother has opened three accounts in my name and while she has been making the minimal payments on time, she's racked up a tremendous amount of debt.  some of the cards were opened as early as when as i was 2 years old.

i have documentation of everything that has happened, with each page of account information saved as pdfs.

i have spent the past couple of days trying to not panic, i've confronted my parents and am currently looking for cheap apartments so i don't have to live with them anymore.  however, i don't know what to do beyond that, really.  30k of debt is enormous and i don't even make that in a year.  i don't even know how to begin tackling this.  i just know that i'm heartbroken and i feel absolutely betrayed.  i never thought my own mother would steal my identity.

should i put off college and try to pay it off by working more jobs?  should i stay living with my parents to save on rent?  what should i do to tackle this debt and fix up my financial situation so i can move on with my life?  i don't want to be my parent's piggy bank anymore.

update: equifax has me quoted at 481.  when i opened creditkarma it asked about a possible home mortgage made in january 2016 that i do not see in my report.  i do not have a mortgage.  i hope this is a mistake and that there was no mortgage made in my name.  the cards that are there have me as an authorized user, thank god.  there are still 5.5k in loans, however, and the fact that my mother wants me to pay the student loan that is in her name.  her listing me as an authorized user, however, may still lose me my clearance and thus my job in the military.  i will be speaking to ncos tomorrow regarding what to do next and the status of my clearance.  in regards to the years of training (i lost track of your comment i am sorry), i had to learn a new language in addition to ait.  this took two years.

update 2:  the mortgage thing has been explained.  thank you.  i am an authorized user on the two accounts but have never been given a card nor been informed of the existence of these accounts.  i have simply been associated with her rotten credit it would seem.  i do not know why i am listed as an authorized user as i have signed nothing and have never touched credit in my life until checking my credit a few days ago.  i doubt this is reportable to the police, and will be talking to the financial and legal support provided by the military tomorrow.  thank you all for your advice!

update 3:  a lot of people questioning my military service.  understandable as my situation is strange.  i am an e4 35p who has recently got out of tradoc.  ait for 35p is one of the longest in the army, as it is language dependent and i was required to become fluent in a foreign language.  my language course at dli took a year and a half, and due to financial and familial issues stemming from what i'm detailing right now, i was recycled a few months in and had to start over.  it ended up lasting 2 years for me.  i have been with my guard unit for two monthly drills now and am still relearning how to be a civilian again.  trying to figure out my credit and how to become independent is also a part of that, and why i made this post.  thank you all again for your replies and advice.  i will do my best to read all of your comments and give updates as i deal with this issue.",10

"just got let go. no savings, two young toddlers and a house. feeling pretty scared right now.. no forewarning. i just went into a reoccurring meeting the same as every other friday and was told i was being let go immediately. this job paid well, and even then my wife and i live paycheck to paycheck with all of our bills and trying to pay off an a/c unit. we have virtually no savings. i know i need to apply as much as possible. i don't know why i'm even really posting, i'm honestly just feeling pretty scared right now for my family.

edit: thank you to everyone who's providing laid out plans, and helping me keep my head on straight as well as my sanity. i'm actively applying and trying my best to keep calm. to those that seem frustrated why i don't have savings prepared...i really don't know what to tell you. one day you've got 15k in the bank and you feel safe, the next year you get hit by a hurricane and your roof is wrecked, and your ac unit dies in fl. on top of that, we've been paying car payments since our last car died two years ago. believe you, me - drove my 2003 hyduani until the wheels fell off. shit kinda just came at us all at once, and we never really recovered. the plan always was to get rid of these ever-looming debts hanging over our head so we can get back to saving. the goal was to throw large payments at the things so we could get rid of them quickly without accruing interest. the wrench in that plan was i just wasn't expecting to be fired.

edit #2: for those messaging asking what i did. i worked remotely as an onboarding manager for a digital marketing agency. 40 hours a week, salary. i wasn't given a reason why i was being fired, but i suspect it was due to a client complaint that happened a few weeks prior. the onboarding client at the time kept sending me the wrong thing and got extremely worked up after i sent him an email with the words ""i'm sorry, but this is not what we need"". kept sending wordpress backend access to his website when i was simply asking for domain hosting information from godaddy. he got mad at me and complained directly to the ceo threatening to quit. ceo flipped out and was ready to fire me on the spot, but was convinced not to by my manager. from then on, i felt weird vibes from my manager almost every day. things started to clear up on onboarding in terms of workload, and they were having me offboard the remainder of my clients to their assigned csm. it's clear to me now that they were waiting for things to die down before pulling the plug. i was definitely in shock while i was being fired because i didn't even ask why. they told me they're not going to be paying me for november, but prorating me for the days worked this month thus far. doesn't feel right at all, but then again this company has a history of shitting on their employees.

i had great credit and qualified easily for a loan and set up payments with the loaning bank for automatic bill pay.  i got the car five years ago and was very excited knowing it would be paid off at the start of this year.  over the past 5 years since  making the purchase i have gotten married, bought a forever home, had a child, and am pregnant with our second.  i'm pretty on top of things and in charge of finances as my husband is notoriously bad with money.  this january i see the car payment come out and read up on paying off an auto loan.  i learned that sometimes a credit score will drop right after a big loan is paid off, but that it will bounce back within a few months.  

cue february.  no car payment comes out.  no worries.  i knew we had one or two payments left on the car so i assumed the final payment was made!  yay!  i checked my credit score on credit karma to find that my score dropped some, but it was to be expected.  i am now over the moon to have completed my first car loan!  

today i decided to check my score again to see if it had in fact bounced back up.  to my horror i discover my score has fallen an additional 78 points!  i start digging and discover the car loan is claiming i never made the last payment.  after being up all night with anxiety about the situation i get in contact with the bank this morning.  it turns out that this bank only accepts the final payment via phone or mail even with auto bill pay set up.  this bank also will not let you set up online banking with them unless you also open a checking account with them.  a loan account alone will not suffice.  

so the moral of the story is that despite being extremely financially responsible and doing everything i thought i should be doing - shit happens i guess.  make sure your final loan payment meets all the requirements of the bank and do not assume that auto bill pay ensures that your bill is paid.  

side note: this bank also does not send paper or email or phone notices when a payment is missed.  so despite 5 years of on time payments - there was no notification that the final payment did not occur.  it was only checking my credit score that alerted me to the situation.  had i not checked it i hate to think the outcome given the account was now 90 days late.  so now i'm coming to grips with my ""fair"" credit score and mostly thankful that i have no major purchases in the near future where my score would be needed.  

tldr:  make sure your final loan payment does not have to be made via phone or mail.  it turns it that auto bill pay does not necessarily mean that payment is made if the bank has stipulations saying otherwise.

edit:  bank is bmo harris.  it is not local to me.

edit 2: for those asking - i live in illinois where it has taken 2 months to get a new drivers license mailed to me.  where it takes months and months to renew a foid card despite the only change being that you are a few years older and actually had it updated three years earlier when changing last names.  this was my first car loan and i had no prior knowledge on the timeframe needed to process a legal document given how long everything else in this state takes.  i had decided to reach out or look into it more if i didn't get anything within the next month or so when all this went down.  i'm feeling rather foolish about the entire thing and hope that sharing can help some others from potentially going down the same path.

update:  first - thanks for the advice on helping my credit score (as scammy as credit score can be).  i just got the opportunity to sit down and call the bank (rascally two year old needed worn out before a long phone call was possible).  it took some transferring around and initially they were going to have me submit some paperwork for review.  i made sure to ask all the little questions suggested and point out 59 perfect payments previously and the lack of contact from them.  this lead to the credit dispute person speaking to her supervisor.  after she returned to the call she said her supervisor said to go ahead and bypass my submission and that they would submit a retraction with the credit places and that it should be resolved within 14 days.  

i rephrased everything she said they were doing to get a second confirmation i was understanding correctly.  she verified and even said this is a recorded call so she is being completely direct with me and not just telling me what i want to hear.  so hopefully in the next 14 days i will have a title in hand and my credit score will be sparkling again.  thanks again for everyone who encouraged me to call back and continue to ask to speak with whoever needed to make this go away.",10
"breaking the habit of going out to eat. i had a huge long post typed up, trying to figure out where all of my money is going, why i'm so broke, and why i can't pay down my credit cards. after looking through my bank statements i realized that the problem is 100% without a doubt how often i'm eating out. after calculating, i've spent over $300 on dinners, fast food, and coffee in july alone. i make an okay living but not enough to spend like that, and this doesn't even include grocery shopping which i've still been doing!

it hasn't even felt like i've eaten out that much so i'm horrified right now. sometimes i work crazy hours so the convenience seems worth it, but also sometimes i just get bored of what i have or feel too overwhelmed to go grocery shopping.

&#x200b;

how in the fuck do i turn this around? it's like second nature and i don't even think of it at this point but i have to change this pattern. if you've been through this, what helped you?

"just opened some mail to find that have had an outstanding balance from an er visit last november where they didnt have my insurance on file even though it's the er in the hospital i work at and have insurance through. now it's been sent to a collection agency and im freaking out.. ok i visited the er back in november last year for a broke finger. while i was checking in i tried to give the  nurse my insurance card but she said that it's already on file so business went about as usual. i had received a bill in the mail from my insurance for 100$ later on so i assumed it was for that visit and paid it without thinking. my mail has been sent to my parents house the past six months and sometimes they would hold my mail without realizing before telling me or dropping it off, coupled with that wait time and the fact that i didn't open these certain envelopes  because i thought they were from a physician's group i stopped going to 8 months ago and they were trying to get me to sign up for some program they had been pushing for a while (just a website to signup to view your chart) so i didn't open mail from them. well all those were notifications of my bill and for some reason the er i went to was part of this group and i never realized it. anyway now i'm past the 30 days they give you to challenge th debt before giving it to a collection agency. i know i messed up but this hospital screwed up. and what i dont get is that i didn't even have a copayment when checking in so idk how this happened.  should i attempt to contact the hospital or is that a lost cause now? i'm not sure what to do.",10
"my retired father has a considerable income but is having trouble paying bills/taxes. i'm worried about his spending habits. what course of action, if any, can i take?. my father is 74, he is retired. he inherited \~1.5 million usd from his parents. he has that money invested into an annuity, from which he receives over 5,000 usd a month. he also collects social security, and has a very small retirement from working at american airlines. overall, his monthly income is more than 6,000 usd.

&#x200b;

he lives in utah and his rent is just under 1,400 a month. he is having trouble paying his bills, he cancelled his cable subscription because he couldn't afford to pay 300 usd per month for it. he always has trouble paying his income taxes. he also regularly brags about wearing 2,000 skiing outfits. he claims all of his skiing outfits cost that much.

&#x200b;

he asked me if he could use my address (i live in california) as his place of residence so that he can avoid paying utah state taxes. he wanted me to send all of his bills, mail, etc. to him in utah. i told him i couldn't do that because i did not want to knowingly assist him in committing tax fraud. his immediate response was to remove my phone from his verizon plan after sending me a text message saying he does not want to speak to me and that i'm not welcome at his funeral.

&#x200b;

he has grown increasingly stubborn and mean in the last few months, i'm worried that he either has some sort of mental illness, like dementia, or that he has gotten himself into some sort of debt or drug abuse problem. what should i do if i think he's not capable of managing his finances? is there anything i can do? any advice or information is appreciated, thanks for reading.

&#x200b;

edit: it looks like i may have too many messages to reply to at this point. thank you to anyone who has read this, and anyone who has left heartfelt or useful advice. i really appreciate it. i'll try to read through everyone's advice/comments, whether or not i reply. again, thank you.

edit 2: a few people have suggested contacting adult protective services. that sounds like a good place to start. if he will talk to me again i'll ask him to get a mental health check up, and consider giving my uncle access to his financial accounts to figure out what's going on. 

also to clarify, he inherited 1.5 million and that amount was invested into an annuity. i do not know if my brother and i will inherit the annuity when he passes. 

thanks again to everyone who made helpful suggestions.",10
"i was so obsessed with saving money and frugal living and it made me depressed.. i have been working on an emergency fund and retirement to a lesser extent. but i went a little overboard. i prohibited myself from seeing friends to save petrol and money and i wouldn't allow myself to buy meat when i felt like cooking something fancy. i've missed out on bands in town. i don't travel to see my mother because the train fare means spending. now i'm sitting here feeling sad and lifeless. i'm just posting this in case someone here is going down the same path. being sensible is one thing, denying yourself completely is another and a false economy. i would give up a bit of my money not to feel so depressed now. anyway i'm going to go treat myself to something today so hopefully my mood will improve.",10
"wife broke her back in the dominican and we're at a loss for what to do. as the title says. this is a total nightmare scenario and like most people who would be in this situation too, were completely ignorant as too how we should proceed. 

the story: my wife and i traveled to the dominican republic for a vacation at an all inclusive resort. yesterday afternoon while she was walking by a pool she stepped on a foam raft that someone had left laying out and slipped. this only arose because she cut her foot on a broken tile in the pool and was getting out as it was bleeding everywhere. her legs went out from underneath of her and she fell straight down onto her pelvis onto the hard tile floor. it took 30 minutes for resort staff to show up with a wheelchair, which was absolutely necessary as my wife was unable to walk without it causing excruciating pain. they took us to the small resort clinic to examine her but they were only outfitted to treat small scrapes and sprains. after the nurse there determined that this was out of her league she called an ambulance to take us to the hospital. once at the hospital her pain was largely ignored and she was forced to sit/stand/walk 20 or 30 times with the back injury. after x-rays were inconclusive and difficult to read the doctor did a ct scan to reveal that she had 1 shattered vertabrae and a slipped disc. at this point he obviously recommend that she not move from a laid down position. it's honestly a miracle they didn't paralyze her or cause obvious and immediate damage during everything. the hotel agreed to pay for the transport to the hospital and the initial examinations (including the ct) but has pretty much washed their hands of us once she had to be admitted. oh also, in order for them to pay for the ct they made me sign a release saying that their responsibilities had been fulfilled and we could no longer seek more help from them. 

we don't have travel insurance. we don't have out of country medical coverage from our regular us healthcare providers. i checked with our credit cards and they only offer reimbursement for ""catastrophic"" charges incurred. apparently this doesn't qualify. i'm waiting to hear back from our homeowners insurance to see what coverage's they offer outside of the united states. 

so at this moment we're in a foreign country with a huge language barrier, footing a potentially massive hospital bill unless we can get back to the united states and into our own healthcare network. apparently a medical flight where she's able to be prone can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 which of course, we don't happen to have just sitting around. i feel totally helpless as a husband right now watching my wife in pain and knowing that our financial future could be destroyed.  

sorry for the long post but we've been awake for 24 hours with no near end in sight.

tl;dr: my wife broke her back in the dr and we have no medical insurance in this country. we're just looking for a way home that won't send us into bankruptcy.

"my father has about $400k just sitting in his savings account. what are his best options for long term (10-15 year) returns?. my dad is 61 years old, has a great paying government job and has no plans to retire. he loves his job and wants to work until he dies. subsequently, he has never really planned for retirement. he has some funds in his 401k but the majority of his money he tends to hoard in a savings account because he sees it as being more liquid as opposed to having his money ""tied up"" in investments. 

i have tried explaining to him numerous times that he needs to put his money to work so it can earn some interest as opposed to it just sitting there. but i am no pro at investing. what would be the best advice for next steps? ideally i think he would benefit from a ""set it and forget it"" type approach where he can dump his funds and watch them grow over the course of the next 10-15 years. assuming an average annual return of 6%, i think he can make some decent gains. but again, i am no pro - my best guess for him would be vanguard etfs. or is this amount worth looking into a fiduciary? what say you, pf?

"you can ask your bank to waive fees. this is reposted every couple of months, but it is useful to remember.  if you're a customer in good standing, banks will often waive fees on one condition: you have to ask. 

i'm posting this now because my bank charged me $30 for going over my credit limit.  the following is the dialogue i had with my bank:

me: hello, a few days ago i was charged $30 for going over my credit limit.  i was wondering if you guys could waive that for me. 

her: one second mr. x... (10 second pass)... okay, the fee has been waived.  just be aware that your credit limit is $x and if you go over your credit limit, a fee will be automatically applied by the bank. is there anything else i can help you with?

"i buy things online when i'm bored and i honestly don't know how to stop. not sure if this is the right place to post this, but:

"salary negotiations: when to speak first and when to hold your tongue. when people are planning to negotiate salary, i frequently see that they are given advice like ""never be the first to say a number."" while this is frequently correct, there are many other situations in which you are leaving a lot of money on the table if you let the hiring company establish a salary range. why is this, and which is which?

we would be remiss if we didn't pause to discuss the psychological concept of anchoring(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anchoring) here. *anchoring* is our tendency to be ""anchored"" to the first number when making decisions. a simple example: lets say i have an apple i want to sell you. i'm willing to part with my apple for a minimum of $5, but i'd really prefer to get more. for your part, you're willing to pay up to $10, but you'd really rather pay as little as possible. now, let's say i speak first and i set my price at $12, because i'd really like to get at least $10, so i bumped it up a little bit. what happens next? we negotiate back and forth - you probably offer 8, i counter with 11, and we settle on $10. but what if you had spoken first and offered $3? we certainly would have ended up with a lower settlement. anyone who has (like i have) been fleeced by a street vendor remembers this lesson rather ruefully - but we don't always think to apply it to our salary negotiations. 

this effect is often subtle and very hard to avoid - in one classic study, participants wrote down the last two digits of their social security numbers, then bid on items. people who had written down bigger numbers made bids that were up to twice as high as people who had written down lower numbers - even though on the face, the numbers shouldn't be linked at all. 

this is why it can often be so powerful to be the one to set the range. but there are other situations in which it doesn't work at all - usually, in situations where you badly want a settlement, but don't have enough information on what might be acceptable to the other party.

every negotiation has a bargaining zone - the zone where my interests and your interests overlap. in the apple example above, our bargaining zone was between $5 and $10 - any price between that range is acceptable to both parties. but what if i was selling an apple and had absolutely no idea what you might pay for it? in that case, it might make sense for me to let you speak first and work from there - especially if i would take almost any price for the apple. that way, at the very least, i know that we can make a deal.

the goal, then, is to determine to the extent possible what your negotiating partner's bargaining zone is. we do this by identifying their walk-away point - the point at which the cost is too high and they would rather do something else instead of make a deal. this is when you start searching on glassdoor, indeed, and all the other salary websites to try to figure out what the average market pay for your position is. then you can anchor the negotiation by asking for a high, but not unreasonable salary. 

what else can you do? try to figure out what that ""something else"" is that a company would rather do than say yes to an unacceptable deal (sometimes called a 'batna,' a ""best alternative to a negotiated agreement""). this can come in many forms - on a personal level, your batna might be to keep your old car rather than pay a cent over $10,000 for a new one. for a hiring manager in a salary negotiation, it could mean many things:

* leave the position unfilled and restart the search for candidates
* promote someone internally to take the role
* not hire anybody at all
* hire a candidate who is less qualified, but less expensive

and so on. you can see how trying to identify the best alternative for your negotiating partner can help you guess at what their bargaining zone might be - the worse their alternatives, the more eager they will be to make a deal. 

**so**, you should speak first when:

* you have a rough idea of what your negotiating partner's bargaining zone is, so you are confident that your ask isn't so unreasonable that they leave the table immediately
* you know or suspect that your negotiating partner has bad alternatives to reaching a settlement with you
* you have less to lose - if you miss the mark and your negotiating partner leaves, you aren't going to be out on the street

you should let the hiring company speak first when:

* you have little to no idea of what your negotiating partner's bargaining zone is and you worry that your ask will be so unreasonable that they will leave the table immediately
* you know or suspect that your negotiating partner has good alternatives to reaching a settlement with you, so you want to be sure that the settlement is acceptable
* you have more to lose - you badly need this job and even a bad agreement (for you) is better than no agreement",10

"just turned 18 and am being kicked out. my mom kicked me out today two weeks after my 18th birthday. i had expected this because she threatened my brother with it but his situation was different. he had graduated high school his junior year and then went into the army once he turned 18. he never wanted to go off to college. i'm still in high school and will graduate next month. i live in a small rural town in texas and i know some places you can't kick your kid out until they graduate high school but going back to live with my mom is unappealing to me so i'd rather just rough it out for now. my high school has a program where you take classes at the community college in town and those classes count for college and high school credit and i have taken enough hours at the college to graduate with my associates next month as well as long as i pass all my finals. 
i have a car but the title is in my moms name. she says she will switch the title to my name this week but i know that i will need car insurance before that can happen. also my drivers license is from a different state so i think i need to get it renewed before then also. i have 1500 cash but no real job as of right now. i can start applying once i find a place to shower and have time to go get clothes from my moms house. i have a phone that i've paid off but my mom says she is going to take me off of her plan next billing cycle which ends on the 18th of may. i'm paying for unlimited data right now and am using my phones hotspot to connect to my laptop so that i can do my homework. i have one friend that i can ask to stay at his place but i'm not sure if his parents would be okay with that. i don't have any relatives that live anywhere nearby.

"in-laws want to gift us 200k for a new home. my wife and i have lived in the first home we ever purchased for the past 7 years. in that time, we've had 2 kids (they are 18 months and 3 yrs old atm). we currently live in minneapolis proper and have been exploring schools for our oldest in case we want to move into the school district we feel suits our needs/priorities.

over the past year and half, my wife has become obsessed with dave ramsey and we have paid off 20k debt (student loans, new car, yet have another 10k to go) all while making around 100k. day care is 30k a year, so i'm actually pretty impressed with how strict we have been budgeting.

my in-laws have taken notice and feel we have a solid budgetary mindset, and they want to help up on this trajectory. they have consistently said they'd rather help us when we need it rather then watch us struggle and inherit their hard work after they die. what a generous philosophy! 

so...here i am. i'm looking for the best way to go about accepting their gift. 

-do we sell our house and take out a mortgage on the new one and simply have them send the lender a banknote?

-do they purchase the home, and then we buy it from them minus 200k?

-we owe about 190k on our current home. should we have them pay off our current mortgage and start fresh with sizable downpayment?  

-other ideas?

my father in-law doesn't really have a financial adviser, just a guy at the bank he talks to. he's the one that recommend he start selling some property and ""liquidating"" his assets since he's near retirement. that's where this idea sort of came from.

(cheating is real shitty ya'll.) some background: i'm young and really stupid. i was giving him my whole paychecks and letting him decide where what goes and how much i get back. i have no idea where all my money went. stupid, i know. bills were always paid for and i was pretty much always broke, but with everything i needed.  
i live in apartment where my share of the rent is 600 and my phone bill is 100. 
going back home to family is unfortunately not an option.  
i'm starting school soon and i need to figure out how i can save with what i have, and what i need to do. 
so far i have a minimum wage job ($10) with 30 hours a week. i was looking for other jobs but can't afford to not work until then so this will do. i plan on getting a second job so i'm at least hitting 50 hours a week. i'm making tips too, and all of that immediately goes to savings. 
luckily my job is within walking distance so i'm going to do that instead of paying for parking and gas.  
i'm going to pack lunches and snacks but in case i can't, my job offers 50% off and the sides are 3 bucks to begin with, so it's not that hard on my wallet. i have a roommate so groceries and other expenses will be split.  
i feel like i need to be doing more. what can i do at 19?  
edit 1: i've gotten so many positive responses and first off i just want to say thank you so so so much. let me give a bit of an update because today has been a tiny whirlwind with work and all.  
first off, i'm down to 5 bucks thanks to a forgotten gym bill i stupidly let my ex and our old roommate charge to my card. i know 30 bucks isn't a lot, but man if i didn't cry over losing that $25. but it's oh well, i'm canceling the membership and i'm getting tips tomorrow so i'll just start over again.  
a lot of people have asked why i can't go home, and honestly, i have no beef with my family. my mother is a wonderful woman who works at a domestic violence homeless shelter a few cities away. she lives in a tiny house with my 4 younger siblings and has recently also moved in a woman and her child from off the streets. when i say tiny, i mean a 2 and a half bedroom house that takes almost 5 seconds to walk through fully. she doesn't make a lot, and taking me in could mess her up financially and honestly it's just so crowded. she has a heart of gold and tries to support me in any way she can.  
i want to say something about my ex. overall, he was a good person who let his depression consume him and didn't want to seek help for it. i tried and helped as much i can, but when i started getting hurt more than making any difference, i knew i had to go. he's never had an example of a healthy relationship. all in all, i hope he gets help and grows to be the kind of person i know he can be, and i'm sorry i can't be there with him.  
i got in contact with a recruiter, i'm not sure if i'll enlist but i'm weighing it as an option and talking to someone about it will be nice.  
i have a few leads on a second job, and i want to thank everybody who has been offering jobs and housing. unfortunately, i don't seem to live near any of you! i'm a state by california.  
also, i will not be splitting the grocery bill.  that seems to be unanimous.  
i'll be looking at my phone contract as well.  
when it comes to school, i'm going to talk to some school counselors to see what would be best to do. 
i didn't expect the support and outpouring of love that came from this post, but you guys gave me hope. i love you reddit. let me know if i can answer anything else, i think i covered it all but again it's been a crazy day, with work and walking home i had to take a nap i was so exhausted.  
thanks again reddit! ",10
"i was impacted by irma and capital one just gave me $150 and they will probably help you too (if you were impacted by irma or harvey). i heard through the grapevine that if you had a capital one credit card and you were impacted by irma you could receive a $100-$150 credit by simply calling and asking for it.

i called and was told they were authorized to only give $50 credit. not what i was hoping for, but still helpful.

i also have a 360 checking account. i called them and they were able to find a $100 bonus that existed when i opened my account and were able to retroactively apply it.

so, capital one just got a customer for life. more importantly, other financial institutions might be similarly helpful so it can't hurt to call your bank and/or creditors and see what they can do for you.",10
"my child was claimed on taxes by his mother but i was supposed to claim him. what can i do?. my son's mother and i have split custody of our son. in the past we have alternated on claiming him on our taxes. i was supposed to claim him this year. she just told me she claimed him and would continue to do so instead of filing for child support. is there anything i can do if she has already filed and claimed him? 
thanks for all the replies and advice! to clarify we were never married and have nothing in writing or have been to court regarding custody or child support. ",10
"40, single. laid off after 20yr. no savings. no income. physically unable to leave house. have 401k and a house i'm still paying on. can i make anything out of my situation or is this it?. i hate to share a sob story, but that's what i've got and i need to pick brains for ideas i may be missing.

i am a 40yr old guy. after 20 years with the same company, i was just laid off from my senior technical analyst / senior technical support engineer position. a few years ago, i began to have severe trouble with my back to the point i could not even navigate my own home. this did not affect my work, however, because i was already telecommuting full-time (and have my entire career).

finding a similar job is proving difficult, given the limitation that i can not leave my home for an interview or for the actual work. (and mind you, there is no reason my position can not be fully performed remotely). unless a job specifically announces it is remote work, i'm not sure how to squeeze into it *anyway*, and ask for my need to be treated as a ""reasonable accomodation"". i am *perfectly* capable of doing the work i've done for the last 20 years. literally the only thing holding me back is an employer's unwillingness to set me up with a pc, vpn, and phone remotely.


**income / debt:**

at the moment, nothing. some 'unemployment' payments should be coming in for a little while, but that's it. i should have a little money coming in from being laid off and it'll be just enough to pay off my $6k in credit card debt.

my income up until this point was a base salary of about $86k, but with shift-work and on-call pager-duty, was about $135k this year.


**savings:**

i have $190k in a 401k and $10k tied up in a prosper account. the 401k has an outstanding $18k loan, which i've been told by fidelity that i can let ""default"" after 45 days and then (i think) that $18k will be treated as income and taxed the same for the year it defaults in (and then i'll also pay an extra 10%, so probably totally $7500 on this?).

i have enough money in my checking account to pay my mortgage on december 1st and january 1st. then i have literally no more money.

that's all my savings. that's it. yes, i used to have a lot more saved and invested. yes, i know i should be in a much better situation than i am. given the length of my employment (entire adult life with this company), i took the risk of helping a friend to the tune of $200k over the last two years. i expected that i would buckle-down in 2018 and regenerate my safety-net from that point on. i was not expecting to lose my job this thanksgiving of all times. yes, this was stupid. i just really wanted to help my friend out and didn't realistically thing it would destroy me.


**assets:**

i have a home in the denver metro area that i bought for $195k in 2010. it has had about $100k or so invested in it (gutted the basement and two floors to update them from 1969 styles, insulated the attic, updated the 50amp electrical panel to 200amp, added some 20amp outlets on two floors, added a very nice new bathroom, installed a new boiler, installed new baseboard hydronic heating, new evaporative cooler, new roof). it could still use some finish work to make it presentable for a sale. zillow claims it could sell for something like $330k. i have no idea how accurate that is or how fast it would go. i still owe about $140k on it.


**monthly expenses: (~$1,950)**

* mortgage: $825
* property tax: $200
* homeowner's insurance: $220
* power: ~$250-$300 *(it has been about $140/mo while i'm here alone but i may have a sibling and their sigifnicant other move in and last time they did that it easily jumped up to about $300/mo).*
* cell/ting: ~$20 *(this includes my service and a phone for my aging mother).*
* city utilities (trash, sewage, water): ~$40-80 *(is around $40 when i'm alone. probably  more like $80 with guests in the house).*
* internet: ~$100 *(need it to job hunt or do just about anything else, since i'm not able to get out of the hosue to even go to the unemployment office and file things in person, for example).*
* medication: ~$5 *(i take blood pressure meds and urgently called my doctor the day i was laid off to get them to update my prescription for a full year and i can probably fill it at walmart for this).*
* food: ~$150 *(denver is stupid expensive for food. i think i can maybe get enough calories and protein in my body if i mostly focus on rice and beans.)*
* misc: $20 *(i have an elderly cat. i figure $20 or so per month for litter and food).


this doesn't include medical coverage. with the aca, i don't think i can afford that with no income. it seems to be about $300/mo for the privelege of having them pay about 40% of *some* expenses after i've met like a $6k deductable for the year. with a very minimal income, it seems i *might* be able to get enough tax credit to pay only $60/mo. still, for something i can't afford to use, so this is literally money that i'm just paying for nothing. alternately, i can pay like $700 penalty next year and have no coverage (which seems even worse, being i'm 40). this also doesn't include dental coverage. i need some dental work and it looks like dental coverage would be at least $60/mo and i wouldn't even be able to get anything significant done until the *second* year and even then only up to $1500 with them covering 50%. this also doesn't include vision. i don't think i can afford to have *any* of these things and my best bet is to find $700 somewhere and just pay the government to not give me health coverage.


**help?!**

how can i make the best of my situation? i'm really scared, because i'm 40 and in poor health and am worried i may not be able to get a job again at all -- much less an equivalent one. at this rate, i see myself ending up old, literally broke, never being able to retire, and scrounging at some awful job just to barely get by. i never saw my life going this way... it is the way my parents have gone and i don't want to suffer like they have had to.

my sibling and their significant other are probably going to move in in a couple weeks and we have discussed what we can do. it is likely that we will split things three ways (including mortgage) and i will give them their share of equity in the house if i ever sell it (calculated as whatever percent of overall mortgage payments they wound up covering).

if that works out, it could take my monthly expenses down to about $800 including food and pet, but not including any sort of health, dental, vision or anything else.


i can only think of two ideas. 

*sell house:*

i can get someone to help me do some work on the house and then sell it. maybe i'll get lucky and it'll sell fast and for like $330k (the last owners had it on the market over six months before i came along). i'll eat a big loss considering i spent about as much to renovate the house as it has (maybe) increased in value. then i could pay the bank back the $140k and use the remaining $90k (or whatever i get after paying a real estate broker and taxes) to live on. i'm not sure how or where i would live very long on $90k, but at least i'd (maybe) have up to $90k.


*cash out 401k:* 

i can cash out my 401k. it was $179k last i looked. subtract that $18k and it's $161k. figure 30% tax and 10% penalty, so i keep 60% of it. maybe that leaves me with $96k. use $7500 of that to pay off the 401k loan tax and penalty, leaving me $88k. that's $88k to live off of for as long as i can stretch it while having my house to continue to live in (though i'm then paying whatever portion of the mortgage and expenses still).


which is better to lose? the 401k or the house? either way, i feel i am just delaying the inevitable and have no future. i've been living every moment of the last two weeks like i'm constantly hyperventilating.

thank you for reading this. thank you for any consideration you give it. thank you for any advice you offer.

"just got a huge pay increase by switching jobs and needed someone to talk to about it.. i've been working making $16/hr and upon negotiating a raise was given $0.50. this felt like a slap in the face considering i have been taking on a lot of jobs from different departments that have way more members than my team. i decided it was time to look in to some other jobs in similar lines of work and as of a couple days ago got an offer for $23/hr, $500-$1,000 bonuses per month based on how well i perform and medical insurance that costs about 70% less. this was a huge win for me and a big step in making me feel like i am actually progressing with my life. don't ever feel like you aren't worth more, and don't get guilt tripped in to the ""we are all a family"" businesses. sometimes you have to break off ties and start fresh!

edit: did not expect to wake up to this, thank you all so much for the kind words and advice. :)",10
"my mother is impersonating me. throwaway because of the obvious 

i've taken personal finance courses at my school (one of the best classes i've taken, and i've been a long time lurker here of pf), so i've learned about fraud and credit, of course. 

a few weeks back i was grabbing the mail, and saw my name on a utility bill. i know my mom has abysmal credit and is not very good with her money, (not that i can blame her entirely, but that's a story for a different time) so i have assumed the worst: she has used credit in my name in order to pay bills she otherwise would be unable to. 

in all honesty, she is very belligerent in nature, so i try to stay out of her way for the most part, but this is my credit and future we are talking about. 

i did not want to accuse her without warrant though, because maybe she just committed a little bit of fraud, not a lot of fraud, so i went to the credit unions to check my history, which should be non existent from what i have learned. 

i had no idea i have to be 18 to check my history, and i am 17, so i am unable to do so without her consent, which is obviously an issue. 

so yesterday i went ahead and pulled her aside to somewhere private, and, i very kindly asked her about the bill and why my name was on it, and if she had used credit in my name before. 

that was a mistake, apparently. 

she became very hostile, asking me if i had water to shower with, a roof over my head, and said ""fuck your credit"", essentially. she then proceeded to blame it on me, and the money she has to spend on me and school, which obviously is pretty messed up, (i've offered to get a job before, she refuses vehemently on the grounds that i need to focus on school, which is hard when i don't have access to basic supplies, but again, a story for a different time).

i have to apply for a credit card and possibly student loans, housing, bank accounts, and a multitude of other things soon as i intend to go to university, i grew up wanting and have a lust for a bright financial future. 

i know that when it comes time, i can send a report to the credit bureaus to remove the false charges in order to fix my credit, but when they inevitably tell me they are valid, i will have to file a police report and make my mother a felon in order to repair my credit. 

advice on the whole situation please? i'm not even an adult and i have to deal with this stuff, any form of counsel will be read and appreciated dearly. 

if there are any questions i need to answer feel free to ask them. 

thanks!

edit: i am trying to reply to as many of these responses as possible, as i appreciate them all dearly. i am in my 3rd period class right now and have to get some work done, but after school i will continue replying to them all, so know that op hasn't vanished. 

also, i will keep you guys updated as i progress through these issues, i can't just leave everybody hanging after such a good amount of advice has been given to me. 





edit #2:

to answer the most frequently asked questions in one swift movement:

i can not check, nor freeze my credit yet, i am not 18 for a few more months.

i will make sure that the action i take is appropriate, if it is just the utility bill i will not just throw my mother in jail unless it is absolutely necessary to securing my financial future.

i will definitely wait until next year when i am in college to press charges if necessary so i am not in the house. i won't be out of the house for at least another 14 months, as i turn 18 early in my senior year of high school.

i will check out the /r/raisedbynarcissists subreddit, and a deep thanks to everybody who pointed it out, i always knew something was different in my family dynamic growing up, i always just assumed i was a bad son until now, but it seems that is not the case.

i am definitely going to seek both financial counseling as well as traditional counseling after this, as i think i would benefit deeply from it.

my late father is no longer with us, so it is just her.





edit #3: i will continue to keep you guys updated. feel free to pm me, as i will talk to you, and it is a lot easier than reading all these comments, as much as i want to reply to all of them.

this will probably be a 2 year ordeal, so i will make update posts and link them, of course.

current plan, in chronological order:

seek counseling, from what you have all described i am in fact being abused, and have been since i was a child.
get a job so i can add more money to my emergency fund and saving, and finally open the roth ira i have always wanted to open, and possibly get some cd's going. (i love finance, as stated before.) finally fix my car, or buy a new beater that's easy to work on. maybe just sell it altogether, put it into a cd or mutual fund and bike to work, i am not opposed to that.

turn 18, check credit score to see if it really is as bad as i hope it isn't.

assuming it is, begin keeping tabs on it, so i know what is going on.

next, finish senior year of high school, go to university, make sure i have a dorm.

depending on the severity of the situation, get the police report and fix my credit, or offer her an ultimatum, i am not sure yet.

will keep this updated as i decide more things to do.

also, there is an update to the chronicles, which leads me to believe this is not a one time thing: when i got home today, i began looking for my ssn card, passport and bc so she can not use them anymore, and they were not in the family safe where they belong (fishy enough, right?). i then saw her tax folder, and checked there, as she had my taxes done for me. i did not find any of my info, however, i did find out she had been filing joint returns with my father, who had been dead for a few years at the time of the filing of those taxes.

i hope i am not breaking any rules by adding these things, and if i am please pm me and i will make sure to correct any mistakes i make. i just do not want this post deleted because this has been so helpful for my future, both financially and mentally.

my absolute and sincerest thanks from the bottom of my heart to everybody who is helping me through this whole ordeal, i do not mean to be a drama queen or anything but it feels like you guys are actually saving my life.

"don't fall for tax preparers' advertising an advance on your refund based on your last paycheck of the year.. i just saw a commercial for a nationally known tax preparer that said, ""next year, your tax refund won't arrive until after february."" as if this was some new timeline we've never experienced. 

this is absolutely normal. your employer has until january 31st to mail your tax docs.

they are only trying to sell you on taking a loan at 35.9% apr! (per the fine print i just read.)

you are giving up much of your return just to satisfy a fear created only by advertising. 

1) you can probably file your own taxes easily and cheaper unless you have something significant in your portfolio. 

2) just wait on your return, if you use a tax preparer. (with direct deposit, it will likely be there quickly anyway. )

3) if you're (typically) getting a (large) refund, make an adjustment to your tax withholding so you can use that money when you need it through the year rather than giving the government an interest free loan while you struggle to budget.

"(buyer's) closing costs 101. buying a house incurs closing costs(http://www.moving.com/tips/home-purchasing-closing-costs/), meaning costs that don't build equity, above and beyond your down payment.  some are fixed fees, others depend on the loan value or house price.   while these vary by state, locality, lender and mortgage type, we can make general statements about us closing costs; these might be 2-5% of the purchase price.   the buyer usually pays most of these, but sometimes not; more about that later.  

**example closing costs**   
here's a general example of closing costs in no particular location.  see here(http://www.naic.org/documents/committees_c_cst_wg_reducing_closing_costs.pdf) for explanations of what these costs are.  fees are due at closing except as noted.  (please do **not** comment to tell us  your specific costs are different than these examples; that's to be expected.) 

**costs associated with house / financing**  

description | cost range | notes
:--|:-:|:--    
appraisal / application fee | ~$400 | paid up front
home inspection | ~$300+ | paid up front; optional but critical
loan origination fee | ~$700 to 1% of loan | varies by lender
processing fees | varies | aggregate of small fees
mortgage insurance/""funding fee"" | 0-2% of loan | mandatory for va, fha, usda loans
discount points to reduce interest rate | 0-2% of loan | optional

**costs associated with the sale transaction**  

description | cost range | notes
:--|:-:|:--    
title service / recording fees | ~$1000-2000 | can shop around on these
lender's title insurance | ~$400+ | mandatory; owner's policy optional
transfer taxes | ~0.1% to 1+% of price | vary considerably by location, can be big or small
attorney/etc fees | $0-500 | required in some states

**prepaid future charges due at closing**  

description | cost range | notes
:--|:-:|:--    
prepaid interest | ~0.5% of mortgage | covers first month's interest
homeowner's insurance | ~$1000 | first year's cost
property taxes | ~0.3-1.0+% of price | initial escrow
hoa fees | varies | if you have them

that was probably confusing; it's a confusing topic.  to highlight key takeaways:

- many of these are  fees  for mandatory services.  you can choose who provides them in some cases.

- some fees such as taxes and recording fees are set by law.  they may also stipulate whether they are paid by buyer,  seller, or both.

- some of the big upfront fees like discount points or mortgage insurance costs are based on choices you make.

- you would eventually pay prepaid costs anyway so that's not extra cost to you; you just pay them at closing.

- buyers don't pay broker fees in the vast majority of cases; those come from the seller's proceeds.  

here's a calculator(https://smartasset.com/mortgage/closing-costs) you can use to get a more detailed breakdown for a specific scenario.  

**managing these costs**   what can you do to minimize these costs(https://smartasset.com/mortgage/how-to-reduce-closing-costs)?  let's first start with how to reduce the costs, and then see about how to get someone else to pay for them.  

you can shop around for many of these services, especially mortgage services.   get estimates of origination fees and other charges to help you decide which of several lenders has the best overall cost package.  negotiate reductions and credits by getting mortgage companies to compete for your business.  you can also shop around for title services,  you will save some time if you get your realtor or lender to help you first identify the companies that usually have the best rates.  

you can make choices to reduce your up-front costs as well.  for example, you may be offered the option to purchase discount points to reduce your mortgage rate.   that would increase your up-front costs.  in most cases, this is better for the lender than for you, but it depends on your specific situation.   you can also avoid escrow / prepayment if you put down 20% and get the lender to agree to this in advance.  in this case, you manage your own property tax and insurance payment.  

**seller-paid (or lender-paid) closing costs** 

getting someone else to pay the closing costs(http://usmortgagecalculator.org/what-are-sellers-concessions-and-why-do-they-matter-when-buying-a-home/) seems ideal for many  cash-challenged buyers.  many buyers want to  avoid ""throwing money away"", which is one way to describe closing costs. this can be easier said than done, however.

in seller's market, sellers have little motivation to help with closing costs via  concessions, so you won't get much help there.  in a buyer's market, you can write your offer to request that sellers provide a a fixed amount or percentage of the sale price back to you to help pay for closing costs.   since that reduces seller proceeds, they may insist on higher sell price to compensate for this, and the house would have to appraise at this higher sale price.  

there are other variations on this theme where you roll some  closing costs into amount financed(http://blog.credit.com/2013/11/how-to-finance-your-mortgage-closing-costs-71197/) with the lender's assistance; this can also be done for fha mortgage insurance fees and va funding fees.   rules for what is allowable are determined by lender regulations and government mortgage rules. 
 these tactics can let you buy a house for minimal up-front cash, but they reduce your equity and increase your payments, too.

so, the hope is this gives you an idea what to expect.  i've purchased a number of houses in various states at circa $300k prices, and i've typically paid something like $6000-8000 or so closing costs, without using discount points or seller concessions, but including prepaid escrow.  

hope this helps!  big credit to /u/bhfroh who provided  excellent input to this.   questions welcomed.

"my oil company is charging me $2.75 a gallon but oil is only about $2.25 right now.... i'm renting a house in south county, rhode island and we just got our first oil delivery. they're charging us at least $0.50 more per gallon than the market price right now. they're doing this because my roommate and i are college students and this is our first time renting. how should i approach this? it was a 130 gallon delivery too because the tank hadn't been filled all summer.

edit: we couldn't chose our oil company. the property management company told us we couldn't move in until we set up an account with this specific company.

edit edit: wow i get back from work/school to this. thank you so much for the input! anyway, it's too late now for this, but it says in our lease that we must only have oil delivered by this one company and we must have auto delivery. this is strange since my landlord has a separate person who maintains the heating system in the house. in other words, the oil company just delivers the oil and doesn't perform service or anything. anyway, i called some other local companies and the most expensive price/gallon i got was about $2.45. i plan on talking to some of the off campus administration people at my university about this to see what they say, mainly because i'm avoiding studying for this signals and systems midterm. once again, thank you all so much!


last edit: **i am not comparing the price i was charged to the literal cost of a gallon of oil, i am comparing it to what other companies in the area are currently charging. thank you to the 8 million of you who said the company needs to profit; i had no idea how capatilism works.**",10
"i'm a 18 high school graduate and i'm being kicked out of my parent's home, have 300€ in my bank account and no idea how to survive in the real world. hello. my parents are kicking me out of the house since their legal duties are fulfilled and i was hoping you guys could help me figure out what i should do.

"did a job for a year before company hired a new guy. paid new guy $30k more than me. new guy left, now they won't pay me his salary due because i ""lack experience"". so for most of 2017 i was ""on loan"" to another department in a required non-tech pm position. previous (male) project manager was paid $75k eight years out of school. i am a woman who made $50k when i started ""helping"" 3 years out of school. was in way over my head, but did all right given the circumstances. got a promotion and a big raise out of it but begged them to hire someone because the boss and the work were quite literally hell and i threatened to quit (hence the promotion and raise). ended 2017 making close to $59k.

they hired a guy with ""20 years experience"" that had nothing to do with our industry and paid him $92k. he was a nice person but absolutely sucked at the job. i trained him for three months but he absolutely floundered. the position got a new, nicer, more reasonable boss during the six months new guy was there and job got way less stressful. new guy nonetheless received a terrible review and voluntarily left last month. 

once again, i am ""on loan"" because i am the only person who knows the intricacies of the job. only this time i am still doing the normal work in my actual department on top of helping out. the work this time around is much less miserable so i inquired about the job and rate of pay should i accept it. i was told if i took the position full time i would only be paid $65k because i lack the experience to make more than that. by ""experience"" they mean number of years of employment history. i am currently four years out of college and have only ever worked at this company. 

so my current boat is, despite my being the only person at this company that can complete these essential functions, my company won't raise me to the same rate as the two guys that failed/left because they had more years of work experience than me.  i know i am being taken advantage of, but i am using the company's student loan program to help me pay off my loans, so if i quit during the year i have to pay back the money the company has paid up until the month i quit. that would come to about $3000 as i am trying t burn thru them this year.

my ultimate question is, does pf feel that years of work experience trumps ability to do the job when it comes to pay rates? any advice for negotiating with my company or are they correct in limiting my pay because of my fewer years work experience?",10
"i'm 18, my dad has been unemployed for 3 months, our savings are running out. how can i make money myself to atleast get through college?. thanks for reading this, i really need some advice. i come from a middle class family. my dad is a power engineer. the power industry in my country has taken a severe hit due to power surplus and govt regulations. my dads company just went bankrupt. no other firms are hiring. he has been jobless for 3 months. 




i'm a college freshman studying electrical engineering. i live in an asian country where parents pay for college and kids don't work until they graduate. seeing the situation now, i need to start making money. i worked as a marketing & graphic design intern at two start-ups last summer. i also have two years of experience working on robotics/random electronics projects using arduino/raspberry pi's. 



i need to somehow make enough in order to stay in college and complete my education. i have no clue how i can make money with no special skills. can you guys please give me some advice on how to get through this?




(i tried freelance graphic design on sites like freelance.com/fiverr/etc but i couldn't get anything. in my marketing internship, i prepared a lot of advertisements. i also handled social media pages. a lot of copywriting was involved as well. i doubt i'm good enough to freelance)",10

"my girlfriend has no credit. when signing up for a capital one credit card, they sent her an email needing extra verification. is this legit?. sorry if this is a ridiculous question, but it's started a family argument. my girlfriends mom is adamant that credit card companies would never ask for a photo id, or a photo of her social security card for ""verification"".

"just found out my exbf opened a credit card in my name after we broke up. it is now in collections. help??. hello all!  apologies if this has been answered recently.  i tried to do a search but i'm a little frazzled.

recently i opened my first credit card ever.  when i was attempting to register my account online it kept returning the last four digits of a card that did not match mine.  i called mastercard and they told me i had another mastercard that had been opened in 2009.  i explained that i had never had a credit card before and they were more than helpful with removing the card from my account and reporting to my credit that it was not my debt.  i thought about it after i hung up and suspected my ex-boyfriend might have opened it.  before we started dating he was in prison for writing bad checks and other fraud.  we dated for 6yrs. i know, i'm an idiot.  please spare the lecture i totally hate myself for giving this con-artist a chance.

today i signed up for freecreditreport.com to check in on my excellent track record of paying my first credit card off each month when lo and behold, i have a credit card in my name with a delinquent balance of $939, opened april 2014.  says the creditor is world financial network national bank? i have never heard of this company.  i want to kick myself again because i should have been keeping up with this but as far as i knew, i did not have any credit aside from my lonely mastercard opened december 2016.

reddit, what do i do?  i have read so many conflicting things that has me afraid to call world financial network national bank to even inquire about the card because if i acknowledge it, i'm responsible?  i am lost.  i was trying to build credit and feel like i'm starting a mile behind the starting line because of a bad romantic decision.  what steps should i take to clear this up?  do i have any hope?  thank you.


edit:  i suspect my exbf because when i told my dad about this, he said that in 2009 someone kept trying to set up automatic drafts from his bank account which happened to be at the same bank my ex worked at before he went to prison.  he was still seeing the daughter of the president of that bank while we were together.

edit 2: i just want to thank everyone who has given me advice, pointed me to websites, listed steps i need to take, etc.  i feel so much less overwhelmed now than i did this morning.  i can't thank you guys enough!!  i'm going to take my dog for a walk, eat some dinner, and get ready for tomorrow.  i'll be heading to the police first thing tomorrow after work.  a few people have requested updates so i'll be sure to deliver when i have some solid information.  also wanted to say that a few people have suggested i'm salty because i have no proof other than the weird thing with my dad's account in 09 but the *main* reason i suspect him is because he has prior felony fraud convictions.  but i guess it could be anybody, doesn't matter - i just have to take care of it!  thanks again everybody!!",10

"this apartment won't let us see the inside of the room until i apply... and my friends are pressuring me to do it. am i right for feeling uneasy?. we found an apartment where we want to live... nice deal. $250 for each of us. not bad. only one issue: the apartment is ""full"" and won't let us see a room until we apply (and pay an application fee) and someone leaves their room. 

my friends already applied with somebody else, but that person backed out. now they want me. initially i wanted to do it... but the more i learned, the more uneasy i got. in order to put my name on the application, we have to reapply and pay another application fee. even then, they *still* won't let us see a room until someone else leaves.

sure, there's pictures online, but how can i tell that the pictures accurately reflect what's inside? they can't even get us in to see a single room apartment.

my friends are pressuring me into signing... and i don't want to do it because i think it's unreasonable for an apartment to demand that i sign an agreement before i even see the damn place.

am i being unreasonable? on one hand i don't think i am, but on the other hand, my friends are pressuring me... so idk. 

*edit:* wow. i really appreciate all of the responses. i got a lot to think about. before i read all the responses my friend invited me to go see them and ""ask questions"" about the apartment... i said i would go... but now i'm getting the feeling that i don't want to do business with this company. a company that's putting me through all of this just to see what i'm buying is not a company i need to give money to for the next 12 months. 

my friends are also good friends. they're not malicious. i just don't think they know any better and they're trusting this company waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too soon. in this instance, trust should definitely be earned. 

anyhow: based on everyone's advice, i'm gonna trust my gut on this one. again, thank you so much for the responses. it's really reassuring and it gives me comfort in making the right decision. have a great day :)

"i just discovered that i owe the irs $50k that i don't have, because i traded in cryptos. am i fucked?. i make $47k a year at my job as an office assistant.

at the advice of my friends, i took most of my savings and bought 8 bitcoins back in early 2017 for about $7200. you can imagine how i felt when it went up. around december 2017, i got caught up in the altcoins frenzy and sold most of my bitcoins (about $120k worth) to buy a bunch of different coins. i didn't know this back then but it looks like i owe income taxes on those trades, which adds up to about $50k if i add up state (california) and federal. but with the crash that happened recently, i added up my altcoins and i only have like $30k worth. i only have about $5k in other savings.

how do i pay this? do i have to sell my altcoins, and give them what i can? or is there some workaround?

is all my savings gone now? i feel like i might have accidentally ruined my life because i didn't know about the taxes...",10
"landlord added me to utillity bill, made late payments and now my credit score is down by 260 points.. edit as pointed out by someone : **uk based**

&#x200b;

as the title suggests.

&#x200b;

somewhere in october, i have rented a room from a private landlord. i am not responsible for any bills, i just pay my rent and he has to deal with everything. there are other people living in the house.

&#x200b;

so, the landlord has added me to the gas bill without telling me and has made 2 late payments which brought my credit score downby 260 points.

&#x200b;

i have only noticed this now because i couldn't get my address changed on experian, and i've only managed to do so last month.

&#x200b;

on a free account everything gets updated after a month. so imagine my surprise, when today, while checking my account which i've been working on for the past year to see how much it went up, i see that i've lost all that progress, plus interest.

&#x200b;

i've immediately paid the fee and got creditexpert, checked what was going on, and noticed that i had a utility bill to my name and that 2 payments were late, one of 120 and the other of 620.

&#x200b;

i called creditexpert landline and they've told me they've sent a mail to the gas company to ask what the steps to follow would be, but it may take up to 30 days.

&#x200b;

does anyone know what else i could be doing in this situation?

&#x200b;

i've spoken to the landlord and he is acting dumb.

&#x200b;

tldr: landlord screwed me over, and added my name to the utility bill without telling me, which bill he failed to pay on time, 2 months in a row (120/620), this has negatively impacted my credit score, lowering it by 260 points. talked over to experian and they've sent a mail to the gas company, but that is as far as they can/will help.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit:

&#x200b;

i have called british gas, the utility company, and they have confirmed that the account has  been opened to my name and 2 other people by a ""lending agent"" which we don't know, and they told me that they have made a request to close the account and remove the debt, but, that doesn't solve the problem, because they were able to do this in the first place, they would be able to do it again.

&#x200b;

so, i need to speak to the landlord, find out who this ""lending agent"" is and see what is actually going on.

&#x200b;

i will also file a police report.

&#x200b;

edit 2:

&#x200b;

i have spoken to the landlord, he said he will be paying the bills within the next two days and will take my name off the bills. i seem to be registered to the letting agency. i have requested a copy of the contract that i did not know existed and ask him to change it accordingly and to specifically request that they do not use my details to register for bills or such. i will make sure i give them a visit as well, to make sure everything is being done.

&#x200b;

i do not fully trust him, so i will proceed with my own request of being taken off of everything that has my name on it that i did not agree to.

&#x200b;

i will call citizens advice tomorrow, first thing in the morning and request as much legal advice as they can give me, i want to cover all the risk areas to make sure this doesn't happen again.

&#x200b;

i wil lalso register myself with cifas, as pointed by someone in the comments, for 25gbp they will add extra security steps for when you or someone wants to apply for credit or such under the companies that work with them. for that, i will have to call them first, to make sure the relevant companies are indeed registered with them.

&#x200b;

"always have a buffer in your checking account, you never know when they'll be a problem with your payroll. i recently switched banks. i filled out a new direct deposit form, but was informed by my employer they also require another form to end your last direct deposit. this seemed odd to me but whatever. well it turns out that my employer is issuing me a live check today so when i woke up, my dd was not in my new account or old account but guess what's due tomorrow? rent! my live check won't be available at my employer's main location until 3 this afternoon and i know my new bank will take at least one business day to clear it when i submit it via mobile deposit.

but i have no fear, because i keep the equivalent of one paycheck buffer in my checking account. i'll be able to pay all my required bills today prior to my check clearing. the only thing i'll have to a wait a couple of days on it my roth ira contribution, but it is what it is. shit happens, and employers can fuck up payroll, that's why it's important to protect yourself with a checking account buffer. i'd be a ball of stress right now if i didn't have the buffer in my account but right now this is just a mild inconvenience.",10
"this guy with my first name, last name, and dob is costing me an apartment.. so there's a guy in pennsylvania who was born on the same day as me with my name. i originally found out about it after being denied a job because of ""criminal activity"" that was resolved after i disputed it with the third party company that did the background check. within a few hours i had gotten ahold of the court that booked him and got supporting documentation to prove his middle name and ssn were different. they fixed it after a delay and i got the job.

fast forward to now, and i'm applying for an apartment. i was denied for the same reasons. the guy has since run up quite the arrest report collection. i told the leasing company and they reran my report using more information and it didn't help, i kept getting pinged for them. then i disputed it with the company (corelogic) and after 24 days they gave me my results. they deleted about *half* of the 10 or so reports on my record. all of the reports are from the same county though. but because of the results not completely being removed from my report, i am being denied the apartment. if i can prove it wasn't me, but the courts won't go as far as to verify it, what are my options? do i threaten to sue corelogic for operating in bad faith? the courts won't deal with me directly, nor will corelogic do anything for me but say ""file a dispute and if the courts verify it wasn't you we'll take it off your report."" i have less than a month to find a new apartment and all of this is really making me worried that i'm about to be living in a hotel..

tl;dr some guy didn't steal my identity per se, but he's still impacting my ability to pass background checks because the courts don't verify anything beyond first name, last name, and dob

**edit 1:** okay.. so, i've gotten a lot of great responses about where to go from here. i'm on the road for work currently, so i have to get to sleep, but tomorrow morning i'm going to wake up and listen to a few hours of hold music. i'll give an update after i talk to corelogic, my attorney(s), and the leasing agency. best case scenario, they say, ""oh my god, we were so wrong! we'll fix it and send you a fruit basket for your trouble."" the realistic response will probably be more along the lines of, ""we can't change it until the record is changed and we have 30 days to change it if that comes to be.."" as that's what i got before. 

**update 1:** i just spent the better part of three hours dealing with the credit bureaus, background check company, my prospective leasing agency's corporate office, and the clerk of courts. not too much has changed with the exception that i got my hands on the public records from that county. it's worse than i expected. some of the dockets only have fn, ln, & dob. so the ones with no middle name are still being pinged to me, regardless of the fact that the other cases show that this guy with my name have a different middle name on them with the same dob. also, they said that they have an address on file that matched the pa one with the court cases. well, i explained to them the circular reasoning that the address they have was obtained in error because they obtained it based on fn, ln, dob from the court cases and there was a long silence, then they put me on with a supervisor who was also useless. but now it's being ""escalated"". from where i stand, it's impossible to prove via documentation to them that this person isn't me because they didn't put any information in the dockets other than the fn, ln, dob!! it's just turtles all the way down with these people. my leasing office understands and is being patient. i'm going to turn to the attorney general of pa next to see if i can have those records clarified by having them supersede them with more information for future references. 

also, i don't think i can just change my name and make this go away. i'd still have to provide my previous name(s)/aliases in the future. so i have to get this removed from my credit history and criminal history head on. also, i'm an airline pilot so i have to maintain a positive training history with faa. so if i changed my name, i'd have to go back and get those records all changed with my previous employers apparently. it may be more than just a simple form in my local courthouse.  

**quick aside: *no, friends. i'm not going to have him killed. though i'm sure you guys meant well and everything.***

**update 2:** the corporate office of the apartment building did a little digging and decided that despite the corelogic & credit check, they're going to override and approve us for the apartment. i'm still going to have to dig in and get these records either clarified with more identifying information, or removed. i'm sure this won't be the last of my troubles with this guy. i'll update again after i talk to the attorney general's office tomorrow. 

**update 3:** so it took some doing but corelogic removed those items from my report. pa uses public records, so i was able to get ahold of the clerk of court and have her pull up anything related to my first and last name. she eventually directed me to a public records portal and i was able to access the dockets and match them to the 4 items that were marked ""verified as reported"" on my dispute results. some of them didn't contain anything more than fn, lm, dob. there's no imperative for them to use anything more than that, and anyone can seemingly tell them anything they want if they don't have an id upon their arrest. the records were right next to other dockets that referenced other dockets and court summaries that did contain a middle name. i was able to follow a paper trail and show that at some point the defendant was referenced with his different middle name. 

**here's the rub. corelogic may have fixed my consumer report but it's going to keep happening to me. the advice i got from an attorney is to have them ship me a hard copy of those results. copy those and store them onto a cloud server somewhere that i can get to them any time i need them. then the next time this comes up, show the results to the party or better yet, show them when i apply for anything that requires a background check. and hope he gets his shit together, of course.**",10
"should i fight this plumber bill or just pay it.. last month our 18 year old water heater started leaking out of the bottom.  i realized immediately that it would simply need replacing and called a few local plumbers for quotes.

one of the plumbers came by that day, inspected the heater in our garage and then spent 20 minutes explaining we would need a new water heater.  on the work order it shows they were present for 30 minutes.

&#x200b;

2 weeks later we got an invoice for $116.97 based on it being a minimum of 1 hour service call.

&#x200b;

i would argue it wasn't a service call but a quote, since we knew the heater needed replacing.  included in the bill is a ""shop supplies"" for $7.75 which is apparently shoe covers, that were never needed or even used since it was in a garage.  there was also a fuel surcharge of $6.60.  now, we live in a small city of 20,000 people and you can get across town in 3-4 miles, and 6.60 would get me 40 miles in my van.  last but not least they are charging 2% a month (24% annually?) and i don't feel that we entered into a credit agreement.

&#x200b;

should i fight it or just pay it and move on?  should i report to bbb?  i can afford to pay it but out of principle and for the protection of others i am on the fence about what to do.  i realize some of this is legal but much is financial.

&#x200b;

update:  i called and paid the invoice and was able to get the shoe cover charge removed.

"don't be afraid to negotiate for higher pay!. hi pf! i'm a 20 year old college student and i've worked retail for three years now. i work in the meat department of my local store and we recently hired a new guy to take over for my responsibilities while i ""move up"" to do new things. while i'm training the new guy to do my job the discussion of pay comes up. i was making $8.50 an hour while the guy i was training was making $9.00 an hour.

i brought up my pay to my boss, he didn't even know how little i was making! our company doesn't let our managers know how much we make that way they dont make the people who make less money work more hours to protect their bottom line. 

when my boss heard i only made $8.50 an hour he immediately went to our store director and had my pay changed to $10.75 an hour!

thank you pf! your stories of asking for better pay encouraged me to take that step, which i was too nervous to do before!

"my boss is telling us we ""must"" answer our company-issued cell phones outside of normal work hours - should we receive some kind of ""on call"" pay? (tx). recently, my work issued us company smart phones. overall it has been very beneficial - i work in manufacturing and having a company cell phone allows me to do my job much more efficiently.  (due to company security policy we were not allowed to do basic things on our personal phones like store coworker or supplier contact info, make business phone calls, take pictures of production or part issues, or take notes.)

but i have an issue with a particular part of the ""policy"" on how we are being told to use the phones.  we are being told that we must answer them on weekends and evenings.  the manufacturing plant runs (basically) 24/6, and my department's core hours are 6:30am-5pm m-f (i work in quality).  before we got cell phones, the plant still ran nights and weekends, and had procedures in place to deal with issues if the quality engineer was not in the plant.  managers had cell phones and accepted the role knowing that the responsibility of that role included answering phones at off hours in special  circumstances.  now, we (the rank-and-file employees) are being told that part of being issued a phone is that we need to be available via phone on the weekends and evenings. 

i don't have a problem with helping out within reason - before we got the work phones, i had given my personal cell number to the people in my group and told them they were welcome to try and contact me if they had a question, with the understanding that i might not answer because, well, i'm not at work and i'm not being paid to answer. and i didn't (and still don't) have an issue with trying to be helpful to my work group - it doesn't happen too frequently, and we are mostly all friends. 

but i do have an issue with my boss telling me that since i've been issued a phone, i must answer it even during off hours.  i don't even carry my personal phone if i'm doing common weekend activities like mowing the lawn or going to the pool. 

for example: this past saturday, i got an email at 9am that was a coworker asking a question about a specific item i was more familiar with; our boss was on the distribution list.  i was outside sweating my ass off (yes, it's ass-sweat hot at 9am here) doing yard work without my phone on me.  i replied to the coworker about 2 hours later. this morning (monday) our group got a group text reminding us, ""... you must have your phones with you on saturdays... phones and texts are not being answered... "" (direct quote) 

is this expectation legal?  

i was a salaried employee for years ($70k+), and this year we started being paid as hourly employees (ot and all - it is a good pay increase actually). i believe this has to do with the new government definitions for exempt/salary/supervisor (i'm not a supervisor, i'm an engineer with nobody working underneath me).  i understand that i'm above the $47k government cutoff, but i am guessing they are treating us all this way becasue some people who share my role/title may not be above that range. this is in tx. 

if the expectation is for prompt response on saturdays, shouldn't there be some sort of ""on call"" type of pay for those hours? 

thanks!

i know that i didn't provide much information but i don't know what to think right now.

thank you all

edit - 1:47am, 03/21/15 - i very much appreciate the offers from people for a place to stay and a job and would love to take one up but i don't know if i can trust anyone without major proof of normalcy. i must seem very vulnerable at this point so i feel like many people with malicious intentions are lurking.

edit - 4:30am, 03/21/15 - i don't know what to say. i'm receiving so many kind messages and comments. i'm sorry if i can't get to yours. i very much appreciate all of the help that i'm being offered and i'll try to keep updating this thread as long as i can.",10
"a small personal victory against debt collection. so my husband and i are avid readers of r/personalfinance and were strongly dismayed to get a letter in march stating our $99 at&t bill had gone to collections... when we have never had an at&t account. so we applied what we've learned from the wonderful people here and quickly sent off a letter via certified mail asking them to validate the debt. two days ago, we received this letter below stating they can't validate the debt and are removing it from my husband's credit report and are ceasing all collection activity. 

prior to reading the posts here, we probably either would have paid it or ignored it, causing a bigger problem. so here's a big thank you to the r/personalfinance family! we'll definitely continue to monitor our credit report to make sure it's actually taken off, but it felt amazing to know how to fight against it and win!

"best advise in my entire life. about 2 years ago i was in a bad place financially. i was in a bad seperation which left my bank account in the red about $250, upcoming bills around $2500, lawyer fees at about $7k, credit debt at $11.5k, and a truck loan for $32k. everything was loosley planned out but when my spouse ran off with everything i was in shambles. i was earning $28/hr which may sound like a lot to some people but it was just enough to bearly get by. i was losing sleep and weight from the stress. what im saying is, ive been where many of you are now.

i asked a close family member for a $10k loan. he said yes but it would need to be paid back within 6 months. i knew i couldnt do it. i went to the bank, but didnt qualify for a loan. i had no choice but to make it work.

my brother gave me a piece of advice that i will never forget, and it has changed my life. it was hard to comprehend as a nice guy, but was absolutley correct.

always bet on yourself, and fuck everyone else.

within one week i asked to have my job switched to salary, they said no. there goes my attempt at a steady income. then i asked what it would take for me to make a substancial raise. apparently nothing i could do would get me there.

one week later i opened a phone book, yes phone book. and called competing companies. 3rd phone call got me an interview, that interview got me a 100% raise. in believing in myself i doubled my income. ( seasonaly) my point is, i doubted my ability. after i took the job my prior employer of 5 years tried to offer me a raise to keep me. but that advice rang in my head. now on jobs, i take everything they can give me, i work weekends, and bid on my own contracts. i dont drink, smoke weed or eat out to often. i cook from scratch and my outlet is work and the gym. i turned my career into my hobby, and my hobby into my passion. i got 2 roomates, cut my household bills by 66%. and in that 2 years have paid off the lawyers, 12k in credit debt and havent missed a truck payment. not only that, but ive put away $20k. for me it isnt enough and i will continue to grind. ive booked my first real vacation ever and never been happier.

so to each and every one of you i say this. 
youve got this, dont fret. bet on yourself and fuck everyone else. if your employer cared about you enough they would find a way to help you. if they dont offer, pit them against the competition. its your life, they just live in it!

edit
yes, i have fat fingers and im on my cell phone. im not giving advice on spelling or errors, but thanks.

yes it has taken a massive toll on my free time and social life. i am dating but it is the least of my concerns. and the girls im dating know its business first.

i work about 8-10 hours on site 5 days a week. and about 1-2 hours per night doing the paper side of work. my income has doubled, but my efforts have exceeded that. 

thank you to everyone, i really did not expect to reach so many people. to those who doubt what im saying, or give an excuse as to why im lucky or it wouldnt work for them. this is the attitude that is holding you back. dont let it or anyone else hold you back from getting what you want in life. set strong realistic goals and stay on course. good luck to all of you!

edit 2 shit...i got gold. thanks to whoever did that!

edit 3. my raise in income is not hourly. i do not make $58/hr. i run my own contracts, through another company. they offer me a flat rate for a job. i take every single job. some days i earn $2200/day some days i earn nearly nothing. but it has averaged out to about $60/hr if i worked 8 hours. quite often i work 12-14. not only that but i have expences now that i dont have an employer to provide me my tools. but no matter how you cut it, it was a good move

for those of you still wondering. no dont go out and screw over other people. but if it comes down to you or them choose you.

my buddy has 3 degrees, and is a certified train conductor. he got his train papers and needed a job until he got the call. i hired him on because hes my friend and i love him. with no experience he started as my labourer. 10 months later he got the call and moved. 4 months later he moved back. i pay him more than he made as a train conductor with 3 degrees. he gets a percentage of what we earn, this way i cant lose and it motivates him to work harder. one year in with no experience and hes making around $25/hr. you see i could hire 2 labourers at $11/hr but having him doesnt hurt me. it just benefits us both.",10
"craigslist roommate scam- i almost lost a lot of money this week- here's what happened, please don't let this happen to you!. over the last few days i have been conversing with an individual that replied to my ""roommate wanted"" ad on craigslist. 

everything seemed normal until i started speaking more with this person, who identified themselves as ""c.c.""name withheld for privacy

when i got suspicious, i started searching for ""roommate scams"" online, and found almost exact replicas of some of the emails i received from this person. i thought i would post them here so no one else gets played. i haven't sent any money or given out my exact address, but i was naive enough to give out my personal email and phone number. don't get scammed!

the first reply looked like this:
> i am a young professional (and climbing enthusiast) looking for a single room to rent starting june. ""simple living"" is what i'm after; so a single room, with a budget of ~$700/mo., be sure to only send me your direct phone number .
> i work pt at m-f, as an environmental consultant , and am typically 'out' until 4pm or so, spending most evenings at the gym or hitting local trails. i am an early to bed, early to rise kinda gal, interested in anything that gets me outside and active. would absolutely love to room with like-minded folks; if you happen to be a climber as well, all the better!
> i am 23 years old, with no pets, and one vehicle. very few personal items. if your place fits the bill just send me your phone number, looking forward to hearing from you.

i thought that sounded great. i replied with a little more information about myself, the room i'm renting, and asking her some questions, and received this reply back, which seemed almost as if it was written by a different person, grammar-wise:

> thanks for your response. i'm glad to hear the room is still available for rent. my name is c.c.,i am 23 yrs old female student,fun loving and respectful of others.a non-smoker, don't do drugs,i drink occasionally,and drama free.i'm from edmonton canada i graduated last year in university of alberta i am a very easy going christian girl that love going to church and attend services , have no children i speak both french and english ,i am coming to proceed with my masters degree in micro-biology as my parents wants me to further more with my educational career in the state..
> i'm really interested in renting the room from you and i want you to know that i really love pets but i don't have any at the moment. i also would have loved to see the room in person but since i am presently not in the state then i wont be able to see until the point of moving in so i will like to tell you that i will be moving in immediately after the payment arrangement has been settled and my dad will be responsible for everything so you have nothing to worry about i could have called you to discuss this with you but this is a remote area and can't make international calls as well so you need to get back to me with the your full name and address and phone number for the payment to be made as i don't want to waste time to secure the room .
> i will also like you to tell me more about yourself if you have the chance will also like to know if you have a garage or parking space as i will be having my own car get delivered to the house before my coming so i will send your contact to my dad for him to email you later and he will be the one responsible for my bills so the payment will be made to you immediately you get back to me with the full information required for the payment to be made for you to hold the room for me . i will be looking forward to your email soon. respectfully. c.c..

after that i was dumb and gave her my personal phone number and email. since then, ""she"" has been sending me texts repeatedly asking for my *exact* address (i gave her the address of the apartment building, but not my apartment number yet) so her dad can wire me money. there have been a couple more emails as well, very similar in style and grammar to the one above.

at first i thought since she said she was from canada and spoke french and english, that english might be a second language for her and maybe that explained the poor grammar, but after searching and finding almost exact templates to these emails online in scam forums, i see where this is going.

if i had kept going with the scam, ""chloe's dad"" would have sent me a money order or check for an amount much higher than the rent/deposit. i would be instructed to cash the check and send the rest of the money to the car dealership/company asap. of course, a few days later, the check would bounce, and i would be out whatever amount of money i sent to the alleged car dealer.

i am so happy i was suspicious and checked online, since i could see myself easily falling for this- i tend to give people the benefit of the doubt, and really want to find a roommate.

here are a couple other things that tipped me off that aren't included in the texts above:

- she talks about a hobby of climbing in her first email, and getting her masters in microbiology in another, but when i asked her specific details about climbing and where she would be going to school, she avoided the questions and didn't answer.

- no matter what i put in my emails/texts to her, she never cited any of that information in her reply back.

- although i asked multiple times in different ways, she never specified when exactly she wanted to move in, only saying 2-3 times that she would move in after her dad wired me the money and her car was delivered. no dates given.

- all she seemed concerned about was getting my exact address and phone number so her dad could wire me money. she's actually still texting me about it. for a student who is apparently thinking of moving across the border to another country to go to school, she seems to have no other concerns whatsoever. odd.

i thought i would post this so no one else gets caught up in this kind of scam. i'm pretty lucky in that the nearest school that has a master's in micro is about 30-45 minutes away (which made me wonder why she wanted to move in here) and that i started asking specific questions of her, but oh man did i come close to sending her my exact address and getting money wired. i'm kind of naive at times.

am i correct in my assessment that this is a scam? i'm pretty much 99% sure, but i so badly want people to be good and honest. 

**my question now is:** what should i do about this? obviously i'm not giving ""her"" any more information or accepting money, but should i report this to someone, or say something specific to her? i'm not sure how to move forward. i'm sure there's not really a chance this individual is going to be caught, but is there any way to try to shut this down?

"i could have lost my house today if i didn't have a good emergency fund.. having a few thousand in checking really saved my butt today.

i got a call from a friend who works for the county this morning. they wanted to know if everything was ok, bc my house was set to go up for a tax lease sale tomorrow. i was astonished since the bank that holds my loan should have paid the tax. 

i purchased a new home last year and the tax is a part of my mortgage payment to be held in escrow. i called the tax rev office and was informed the tax bill was sent to my bank but not paid. i asked if the lease sale could be frozen or delayed while i work this out with my bank and was told no.

the only thing that would keep my house from being offered up to someone else was to go to the revenue office and pay the tax bill today.

i dropped the check off, confirmed with the county that my home is paid to date in full and the tax lease will not be offered for sale, and have spoke to the bank about receiving a refund from the escrow and removing them as the tax payer.

so all is good with me, but i kept thinking what if i was 1 of the 40% of americans that doesn't have savings? i could have lost my house over an error and a few thousand dollars.

(now yes you get one more month to pay the tax bill, but that is after a lien on your credit, additional fees, and without having an emergency fund you may not put together a few thousand in 30 days)

**edit 1 - this has really blown up, which is good as it highlights the advantage of emergency funds for all of us short term thinkers, but there seems to be a lot of confusion about what could actually happen. i don't know if people are commenting without reading the body or people infer different things from ""lost today"". so i will clarify, movers were not going to show up to my house today, but the county had no recourse to slow the process of listing the tax certificate for sale. so to me this is the blow that kills you before you actually die 20 mins later and some people are parsing words. the county lists the tax certificate for 30 days, after which they will process a sale (this is a sale of the tax lien not the deed). 60 days later in august the certificate holder can push for foreclosure where your house can be auctioned. you will be offered a recourse to avoid foreclosure, but with each escalation the fees go up. once you get to a demand letter to avoid foreclosure you are now incurring legal fees as well, so for someone without savings this can quickly get beyond their ability to correct.  so is the house lost once a ball is rolling that you can't stop or do you have to wait until you are out of the house to say it's lost? i find the later a little foolish and pedantic. the point is, keep a savings, don't over reach financially, and keep yourself out of situations that could turn because you didn't have enough to maintain the position.**",10

"asking for a raise for the first time ever, looking for some pointers. long story, been working it for a company for about 2.5 years now. currently working at the same rate they brought me in at. at the time, it was a very competitive salary for what i was doing, however, now with all the extra responsibility i've received, i think it's time that i make quite a bit more.

&#x200b;

the reason i started thinking about this is because they brought in another it guy (pretty different from what i do, think end user support vs. asset management), but his pay was significantly higher than mine. even weirder, i reported to this guy's boss, so technically i was higher level than him but still made the same amount as when i came in.

&#x200b;

i've received good sized lump-bonuses every year while working here, but never received a permanent wage increase. i've recently moved around business lines, gotten a slight promotion with a hefty amount of responsibility, and have been doing pretty well at it for the better part of a year now. now i think it's time to schedule a meeting with my boss and discuss a pay raise.

&#x200b;

i'm getting a solid list of items together such as my new responsibilities, the competitive asset management salaries around the area, etc. just looking for pointers such as:

\- what else should i have prepared other than general reasons i think i should get a raise?

\- based on my time with the company and the recent promotion, how much % increase should i request?

\- any tips on the meeting with my boss?

&#x200b;

any info would be incredibly appreciated. really hoping to get a pay increase so i can afford a new place with my gf. thanks so much for anything you guys can offer!

&#x200b;

edit: just wanted to say thanks so much for all the help here!!! literally never had so many replies on a reddit post before, this is beyond helpful. 

 \- also: sorry for the confusion, i meant to say i report to the past guy's boss's boss, meaning i'm at the same level as the new guy's boss. ",10
"progressive insurance made a mistake on my policy, leaving me and my family stranded, what are my options?. my wife and i decided to load up our 3 kids in a prius and road trip from co to tx for thanksgiving.  had a great time. we needed to be home by monday, and with 3 kids it's easier to travel while they sleep, so we left tx at 6pm with the plan of driving through the night.  unfortunately we struck a coyote at 3:30am and left us stranded 160 miles from the nearest decent sized city. 

no problem, we've got full coverage insurance on 4 vehicles, including our newest one; this 2010 prius we just purchased 2 months ago.  but when we made the call, they told us we only have liability?!  that's impossible. 

they said they'll launch an internal investigation on the original phone call, which my wife and i are 100% sure we said full coverage, but that will take a few days starting monday (they don't investigate on sundays). 

they won't tow. they can't provide us with a rental car either.  i've limped the car 8 miles to a small town with no rental services. i need to go 160 miles to the nearest larger town to get a rental and a uhaul dolly to take my car back to co. 

so i'm highly considering leaving my family in a broken car and hitch hiking all 160 miles to get a rental. 

needless to say, i'm so angry at progressive that i'd like to know what i can do?

edit: thank you all for the compassion and for some seriously great advice!  we ultimately decided to have our inlaws laws drive 6hrs from co with their truck and dolly to get us. we're hanging out in a hotel room until then.

now that the sun is out, i was able to see more of the damage. the coyote took out the bumper, fog light, radiator, radiator support, reservoir, somehow hit the abs sensor and the hood latch. i need this car to last us so i'm playing it safe and towing rather than duct taping this thing back together. 

progressive hasn't followed up with us with anything new yet, likely won't until mid week.

edit 2: here's some great lessons from my misfortune! 

- it doesn't matter how many times you've done it, always double check your coverage, especially before a road trip. 

- while all calls are recorded, it still takes days to investigate. be prepared to dig into your savings while they pull their required info or keep an emergency credit card.

- insurance companies carry insurance in case of a policy mixup. save all receipts and keep logs of your expenses. 

hopefully someone can benefit from this, and here's to hoping the insurance company does the right thing! (lol)",10

"got a job & no longer homeless! looking for some help with budgeting.. updated budget: https://i.imgur.com/4coicn8.png

- i was never taught anything about money so i'm just looking for advice, mainly: am i forgetting anything & are there any problems with my plan.


how i got here:

- i became homeless earlier this year due to reasons i don't want to discuss. my mother was sent to jail, and my little sister who is 13 was put in a nice foster home and i visit her every week. she is doing good but unfortunately because i had just turned 18 there were not as many options for me. the family she is with (amazing people) say that they usually have kids with them from between a month to a year. my dad has been out of the picture for 15 years, and i have no other family that i have ever met. 
- i didn't have any savings & it was very hard to find people to work with me. everyone i talked to suggested calling different government agencies but none of the ones that got back to me could do anything to help me besides put me on a waiting list or whatever else, but nothing that would help me then. only things that might help in the future. the one thing i was able to get was a loan through an emergency loan program, which still put me in a tough spot and was not a permanent solution. like an idiot the first thing i did was buy a car because i figured i would need a car to get a job (which is mostly true). i stayed in different places for a while but ran out of money pretty quick. thankfully it is summer so it's warm outside so i was sleeping in my car while applying for any and every job i could find. i realized i had been too picky with what jobs i was applying too and i needed to just suck it up and do whatever would get me a paycheck. basically i got desperate and lowered my standards once it started getting colder at night.
- at the start of this month i got a job, the owner is really nice, the pay is decent, $11.65 an hour, and they agreed to give me as much time as i want, up to 80 hours a week. anything over 40 is $17.5 an hour as well, so i'm taking advantage of that as much as i can. it's hard work but i'm able to manage and i've been working 7am to around 8:30pm monday through saturday and it's pretty doable with a lot of coffee. i have a day off and still have some time once i'm done to relax, with 7~ hours of sleep. i've been maxing my hours since the start of the month and i plan to continue that for as long as possible, again my boss said that this is no problem and will continue to give me as many hours as i want with a cap of 80.
- the foster family my sister is with have never had a foster kid for over a year so that's the deadline i'm setting to have a large savings and a place for my sister to sleep. that means a bedroom in a decent sized apartment. there are other expenses that will come along with that as well, such as feeding another person, school supplies, etc. this is not optional. right now i need to focus on saving as much money as possible. i will also need to do research on what is required to get guardianship of my sister but that's something for another time. i'm sure there are some social programs to help once she is living with me, but again, that's for another time. right now i'm looking for the most efficient way to save as much money as possible, since this is a finance form not a legal advice one.


financials: 

- cc 2 & 3 are 0% interest for over a year, no rush to pay them off besides being debt free, but i'm not losing money by keeping the balance, as long as i do the minimum payment which is $50~ each i think.
- loan 1 is 0.1% (no payments required for another 3 months), from what i understand it stays at 0.1% as long as i continue to pay *any* taxes, loan 2 is 7% and loan 3 is 12%.
- emergency fund: i know this will be unpopular but my emergency fund will be the $6,000 credit limit on my cc with 0% interest until i have paid off my debt, then it will become the money in my savings goal 1. i understand how this sounds risky but i don't really see a downside since it's 0% interest and if i made a separate savings goal for an emergency fund than it would just take more time to pay off the loans anyways, so the end outcome is the same. since all my expenses can be paid by credit card i don't see a downside really. if there is any downside to this that i'm not seeing please let me know.
- $500~ (estimated) monthly cc bill is for food, gas, any money that isn't a traditional ""bill"" type. it's a lot of small things... i've tried to lower it to the lowest possible and i don't think there is much room to improve here. i split that into 2 cards once i have one paid off so the account isn't closed and messes up my credit even more. if i have extra money from not spending the full $500 a month then i will put that into whatever the highest interest debt i have at the time is, or savings if there is no debt.
- also to note, $1100 for rent and utilities is actually a really good deal for rent here. i'm not living anywhere fancy, it's just a very expensive area.
- i get paid 15th and 30th unless it's a weekend or holiday then i get paid a little earlier. 
- car is worth $3,000~ to private party according to stuff i found online, however i need a car and i don't know anything about selling so i'd rather keep it than try to sell it and get something cheaper. it has 86k miles on it and should last a good while longer (crossing my fingers).
- not sure if there is any place where i could be saving money or anything that i'm forgetting to budget for. looking for any advice. thanks.

if you have any advice or just general tips, please let me know. i'm hoping if i work hard i can be out of this hole, have a healthy savings in under a year, and be able to help my little sister.

"chase canceled all my credit cards, none were overdue, i have a 740 credit rating, no warning. so basically, i have a 760* credit rating (only there because i have no long-term credit history, though i have a car loan on a new car i just started paying to build that up as well).

out of nowhere, friday afternoon, my credit cards from chase stopped working entirely. i logged online, both accounts were closed. not only is this inconvenient for me, but i have about 87,000 points (about $870) that i can no longer use. additionally, this closes my longest credit card account that was open for over 5 years.

what can i do about this, because this really screws me. these were the only credit cards i used (2 from chase)

**edit:** logged into creditkarma to see if there was any weirdness going on, credit rating apparently 760 before this, not 740. no accounts closed there. no accounts/inquiries that i didn't make.

**edit2:** called them again, went to another supervisor above the woman i talked to this time, she said that they don't have access to that information, only the executive offices do, that any credit applications i make to chase will be rejected, and that i won't be able to open another account with chase (ever) and the letter has not been mailed yet. i just got absolutely fucked

**edit3:** people apparently think i'm churning; no, i'm not. i crossposted it because i wanted to know if they had any insights, and i only knew of the subreddit given the suggestion of a poster in this thread. so no. there's no churning, i've done nothing that constitutes churning in any fashion.

**edit4:** credit rating was apparently 783, then dropped 15 points to 768 today (according to experian)

after the friday interview (which i thought went really well), they said they would get back to me mid to late week the following week. i sent them an email that evening thanking them for their time and that i looked forward to hearing back from them. by end of day the **next** friday i did not get a response. that monday i sent an email to the recruiter to follow up and see where they were in the decision process and if they needed any additional information from me. no response. it will be **2 weeks** of radio silence tomorrow. has this ever happened to anyone? is this normal? is this a major red flag if they do eventually get in touch with me and offer me the job? i just find it strange how eager they were to fly me out, contacting me everyday for week to arrange calls and trip details, seemingly nailing the interview and then nothing for 2 weeks despite me reaching out to follow up.

edit 2: i'm not offended/mad/butthurt. just never experienced this before in my years of going through hiring processes so i'm asking for other people's experiences. my current job is with a large tech company and it took almost 2 months for my offer but my recruiter was responsive and set expectations. please don't be mad at me, guys. i didn't mean to upset you.

"after 3 years 4 months and 50.2k, i'm done with my student loans!. feeling humble enough to share on reddit. sent my last payment this morning (pending). 

lifestyle: grew up poor, first generation american. i'm very good at budgeting and saving money as material outside of necessity doesn't give me much pleasure. i get easily overloaded so i'm quite the quirk. also a firm believer in working hard now to enjoy life later.

strat: continue my lifestyle, only buy what is needed. pay back high interest first (although admittedly my first 2-3 group loans were around 2k each at varying interest rates just because i needed momentum before paying for my 6-7k group loans) and alaska.

i relocated to alaska as a graduation present to myself and for loans. it had been a goal of mine, it's beautiful and having done extensive research for the year prior, i found i would be able to work my way up fast as young talent was not common, as well as access to the pfd to make paying back loans much faster. worked as a data entry tech for 5-6 months and then landed my second job shortly after as a programmer (both in alaska). with my job, and the pfd, i had some freelance on the side (websites) that helped reach my goal! if you are stem and can survive the winters and isolation for a few years, jobs are available in alaska and the pfd (after living in the state for a year) will help you tremendously although the state is running into major budget issues as of recent so do your research!

degree: ba geography focus in gis/programming

expenses: go phone ($25-$45) internet ($89) gym ($90) food (750-1k a month) (rent $600-$850). 
public transportation only, no vacations and mostly cooked meals at home.

receipts: here(http://imgur.com/a/hssmq) includes last payment this morning, all group loans, and my payment per month. 

woo! it feels great to be 0 and not -50k.

"how gaining control of my finances changed my whole life. hi r/personalfinance. i posted something similar to this a while back and accidentally deleted it before it got much traction. i really wanted to share my story with you guys because my life has changed so much in less than five years. i never imagined that i could be financially stable and enjoy the freedom that comes with it. i had such a mental disconnect when it came to budgeting and spending. if i can get my head out of my ass, anyone can. (i'm in the us for reference)

four years ago, i was a 27 year old woman with a decent career. i had graduated college a couple of years early at 19 and immediately found a job in my field. i'd been working for 8 years, steadily receiving an annual pay increase every year since i started. 

when my computer broke and i needed a new one, i headed to the store with stars in my eyes. at the time, the laptop that i wanted cost around $900. i had nowhere near that amount in my savings account, but surely i'd be able to finance it. i remember very clearly standing in front of a clean-cut kid ten years my junior, against a background of sleek, glowing screens as he told me that my application for financing had been denied and he was sorry, but there was nothing else that could be done. i had to face reality. i was broke. 

even making $50,000 a year and with no student debt, i had somehow gotten myself in financial dire straits. that year, i moved in with roommates to try to save money and even when i cut my rent in half, my situation did not improve what-so-ever. i had several very high interest (25%) credit cards totaling about $10k and i owed around $3k on my car which i was paying 14% interest on. i was living paycheck to paycheck, i had no money in the bank and my credit was abysmal. 

i began to think that some people just aren't ""good with money"" and that was it for me. well really, to be honest, i just tried not to think about it at all. if i had money in the bank, i spent it. instead of working to fix that situation, i worked harder at making money. i got a second job and put in more hours. i was working myself to the bone and i was burning out before turning 30. 

it was around that time that i met my future husband, j. he could see how tired i was with my job and encouraged me to quit and pursue something that i really wanted. i explained that, in my financial situation, there was no possible way that i could afford to make any less money. he started to inquire about my finances and, of course, was surprised to see what a mess i was in. however, being someone who was financially savvy, he assured me that my debt was not insurmountable and vowed to start me on a path to financial stability. 

now, a couple of years later, i work in a different field doing something that i really love. i make a little less money, but i work a lot less and i am happy to say that the stresses of my old life are a distant memory. last year, i actually took a hiatus from work to travel abroad. even on a reduced income, i have five figures in my bank account, a new car and a credit score well above 700. getting control of my finances changed my life significantly because it allowed me the freedom to live how i want to without the constant pressure of working to pay my bills. 

i am certainly not rich, nor am i a financial guru, but i would like to share a couple of things that i have learned throughout the course of this journey. 

first, if you want to change, you can't ignore your situation. i was the queen of ignoring. if i thought my bank account balance was getting low, i wouldn't look at it. if i missed a credit card payment, i didn't want to see the late fee. i would forget about it. i didn't look at my credit report because i didn't want to see all of that red. and in the beginning, when j was trying to set me straight, it was hard. there were a lot of fights because i refused to look the issue in the face. i'd do literally anything else before i would sit down and call my credit card company. admitting that i had been stupid with my money and committing to actively change was very difficult for me, but obviously extremely necessary. 

second, consolidate and stay organized. one reason things got so bad in the first place was that, in my early twenties, i couldn't keep up with my credit cards. i couldn't remember which ones i had paid or when the promotional rates expired and i had no method for keeping track of bills. once i missed a payment and the interest shot up to 25%, i felt helpless and didn't want to look at the statements anymore. the very first thing that j and i did was consolidate my debt so that it was easier to manage. we went to a local credit union and took out a consolidation loan using my car as collateral.  credit unions are a good place to start because they are small and locally owned. you can sit down face to face with someone and talk to them about your situation and i found that they were willing to help. they gave me a loan that paid off all of my credit card debt, so now i only had to pay them each month instead of making payments on four different cards. the interest rate was high, but for the first time, all of my debt was in one place. i set my payment to auto-pay and put it on the back burner. 

third, pay attention to those offers in the mail. after i had consolidated my credit card debt and had been making regular payments for about 6-8 months, my credit score started to improve and i began receiving credit card offers in the mail. eventually, i was getting offers for a 0% balance transfer. i picked a card with no annual fee, a low transfer fee and 0% interest for 12 months. (btw, i couldn't pay off my credit union loan with a credit card. i needed a card that would give me cash that i could use to pay the credit union. this is a thing i didn't even know existed, so examine all of your options) by this time, i had a spreadsheet with all of my bill pay and credit card information so i made sure to make a note of when my promotional rate expired. i transferred all of my high-interest debt to a 0% credit card and then, a year later, just before that rate expired, i moved it to a new card at 0%, so that i had several years to pay of the balance without paying any interest. 

finally, and for me, this was most important, pay attention to your spending. i used to hate looking at my bank statement - mostly because i knew i would feel bad or guilty about the low (sometimes negative) balance. once my situation became more stable and i started saving money, the opposite happened. i felt proud and i wanted to look at my account and see a growing savings. in turn, this made me more frugal and i started to become very aware of how much money i was really throwing away. 

clothes were my weakness. my closet was overflowing with cheap ""retail therapy"" items. now, rather than buy cheap clothes every time i go to the store, i allow myself to buy one luxury clothing item from a high end store a couple of times a year. i've changed a lot of my habits and reduced spending in almost every area that i can. we also live very frugally, in general. we set a budget every month and stick to it religiously. i could go on for another three pages just about budgeting but that will have to be a post for another day. most of the furniture in our house was purchased second-hand and we rarely go out to eat or make large purchases, since we prefer to spend our money on travel. 

i never thought i'd be a financially stable person. i never imagined that i would enjoy budgeting or checking my bank account balance but once i discovered how much freedom i could have by making small, meaningful changes, i feel like the whole world has opened up to me. i hope i can inspire someone else to do what i dreaded for so long. it is possible to fix things even when you've lived with bad habits for a long time. 



edit: wow. thank you for all of the awesome responses. it seems like so many people have been in this same spot and have good things to share. i wanted to post an update because a lot of people have asked the same questions about specifically what to do to cut spending. maybe this sounds cheesy, but it's an honest answer. my entire approach to life has changed. changing my spending habits has been a fight against my own values. initially, it feels depressing to work hard and still drive a beat up car, wear the same clothes more frequently than you want or stay in six nights a week when your friends are going out. but when you restrict yourself, slowly, the things you find important start to change. you begin to discover that having stability is more fulfilling than having things. when you can learn to find great joy in a free walk through the park,teaching yourself a new skill or how to cook a new dish from scratch, you start to feel that spending money on things is a distraction from many interesting facets of life. so my advice in that regard is this - look at your bank statement and honestly examine every item that is not a bill payment. last month on my statement, i only had four charges that were not bills and they were each less than ten dollars. find free ways to spend your time that you find engaging and interesting and take time to truly examine and appreciate what life has to offer beyond consumption.
