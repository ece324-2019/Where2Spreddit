"this is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory. a male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  the male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. he said to the female whale, ""lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" they tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. the male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" at this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.

""sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. you'll have to step outside to smoke.""

so the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. they bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. they try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.

over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. so the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily ""get on my back, we'll get him together"". 

so they start rushing back to the dog. the dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. he then gets another idea and shouts ""where the hell is that monkey! i told him to bring me another lion an hour ago...""

"my favorite joke: everyone knows dave. dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""you know, i know everyone there is to know. just name someone, anyone, and i know them.""

tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""ok, dave, how about tom cruise?""

""no dramas boss, tom and i are old friends, and i can prove it.""
so dave and his boss fly out to hollywood and knock on tom cruise's door, and tom cruise shouts,

 ""dave! what's happening? great to see you! come on in for a beer!""

although impressed, dave's boss is still skeptical. after they leave cruise's house, he tells dave that he thinks him knowing cruise was just lucky.

""no, no, just name anyone else,"" dave says.

""president obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""yup,"" dave says, ""old buddies, let's fly out to washington,"" and off they go. 

at the white house, obama spots dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""dave, what a surprise, i was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
after they leave the white house grounds he expresses his doubts to dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""pope francis,"" his boss replies.

""sure!"" says dave. ""i've known the pope for years."" so off they fly to rome.

dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the vatican's st. peter's square when dave says, ""this will never work. i can't catch the pope's eye among all these people. tell you what, i know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and i'll come out on the balcony with the pope.""
he disappears into the crowd headed towards the vatican.

sure enough, half an hour later dave emerges with the pope on the balcony, but by the time dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

making his way to his boss' side, dave asks him, ""what happened?""

his boss looks up and says, ""it was the final straw... you and the pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'who the fuck is that on the balcony with dave?'",0

"once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named sam.. his order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. they trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was sam, and sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored magical notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before sam had ever reached one.

and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  this time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  as the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had found the second note... 

and the next year on sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  this time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit the glorious third note.  people cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  words cannot do justice to the experience.  the town flourished, as sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

and on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, sam's 25th birthday.  all at first seemed as normal... until sam hit the magical note.  from the start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  he doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the magical note that he knew must be there.

suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously combusted!  the two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  soon the entire monastery was aflame.  by a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor sam.

the townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

the mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""what happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

the old monk shook his head sadly. ""isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""sam sung note 7.""

a few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  he glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  he thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

the next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  he opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  the mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

in there, she found her husband watching the super bowl on television with the vibrator buzzing away beside him.

""what are you doing?"" she exclaimed. 

he replied............""watching the game with my son-in-law.""",0

"the husband leans over and asks his wife. ""do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? we went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and i made love to you.""

yes, she says, ""i remember it well.""

ok, he says, ""how about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""oh jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

a police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, i've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. i'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. so he follows them.

the elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence the old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. as she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. this goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

the policeman is amazed. he thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

after about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. 

the policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, i've got to ask them what their secret is.

so, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""excuse me, but that was something else. you must've had a fantastic sex life together. is there some sort of secret to this?""

shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

""fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.""",0

santa, in complete shock, pulled little johnny's parents aside and said ""in all my years, i have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.""

his parents replied ""we know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior.  we've tried everything.""

santa thought about it and said ""here's what we'll do to teach him a lesson, every place that johnny asked for a present, we'll put a pile of dog poop.""  the parents agreed to try santa's plan.

on christmas morning, little johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed.  seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the christmas tree and checked underneath.

finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door.  

finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.

johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard.  after a while his parents asked him sarcastically ""so little johnny, what did you get for christmas?""

"several centuries ago, the pope decreed that all the jews had to convert to catholicism or leave italy. there was a huge outcry from the jewish community, so the pope offered a deal. he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the jewish community.... if the jews won, they could stay in italy; if the pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

the jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate.

however, as the rabbi spoke no italian, and the pope spoke no hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

on the chosen day, the pope and the rabbi sat opposite each other

the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

the rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

next, the pope waved his finger around his head. the rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

the pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

the rabbi pulled out an apple.

with that, the pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever. the jews could stay in italy!

later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened. the pope said, 'first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one god common to both our beliefs.' 'then, i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us.' 'finally, i pulled out the wine and wafer to show that god absolves us of all our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'he bested me at every move and i could not continue!'

meanwhile, the jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won. 'i don't have a clue!!!' the rabbi said. 'first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger.' then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here. 'and then what?' asked a woman. 'who knows...' said the rabbi. 'he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!'",0

without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. he managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. he took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

coincidentally the father drives up. ""how can i ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""just name your price - i'm a wealthy man.""

""ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, i'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""oh dear,"" says the father, ""i don't carry much cash with me, i only have ten pounds - but come home with me and i'll get more from the safe.""

""no! no!"" says the tramp, ""why ten pounds is more money than i've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""i'm rich! i'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

he finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""i'll have one holiday please!""

""ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""oh, any holiday i don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""ten pounds! you'll never get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

she goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. there - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""i've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""i'll take it!""

a few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""but i've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and i want on!""

""well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, i don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. come back at midnight when it's dark and i'll let you on then.""

so the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. it was the captain.

""hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

the tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

first they went down through the first class level: oriental carpets - 6"" pile. a genuine rembrandt on every wall. leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

then the second class: as above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""a room of my very own.""

""i'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. so that's what the alarm clock is for. enjoy your cruise.""

well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. one-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. he had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

he climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""that was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""where did you learn to dive like that?""

""um, well i've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""i've never seen..."" he broke off. ""hey, i've got an idea"", he started again. ""how would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. i'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""it's a deal!"" says our man. for the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""okay, i'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. we're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""okay,"" agreed the tramp.

two days passed, and the big day arrived. the ship was humming with excitement. everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. the captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""let's see what you can do."" and with that the captain handed him a walkie talkie. and the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the solar system...

he reached the board.

he climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""i can see him!"" yelled a passenger, ""look!!!""

the tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

not a ripple on the surface!

down through the water!

smashed through the pool bottom!

down through the first deck!

smashing through the second!

down!

down!

through the crew's quarters!

through the engine rooms!

smashing through his own little cabin!

and down through the double-strength steel hull of the ship!

still down...!

deeper,

deeper into the murky depths,

till.........

smash!

into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

up and up, desperate, gasping...

out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""hero!"" ""wonderful!"" ""amazing!"" ""good show that!""

and handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""well tramp, i have never seen anything like that, ever. that was the most *stupendous* piece of diving i have ever seen.""

the tramp blushed.

the captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

and the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""well you see...

""for me to tell you, i'll need $49.95""

the captain outrageously asked why.

the tramp said

i'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. i'll even let you decide who leaves.""

donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

in it was barack obama and a large pool of water. barack kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. such was his fate in hell.

""no,"" donald said. ""i don't think so. i'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair.

"two boys in egypt free a crocodile.... in a small village in egypt lived two orphan boys, set and amenhotep. they always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.

one day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher's snare. the two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.

once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! ""thank you, young men"" said the fairy, ""your hearts are truly selfless, and i will grant each of you one wish. what are your names?""

""this is my friend set, and you can call me 'ep'"", said amenhotep.

""very well, ep"" said the fairy ""what is the desire of your heart?""

""i wish i was the strongest man in the world!"" amenhotep wished. 

""very well"", said the fairy, ""but you must always use your strength to help others."" smoke gathered around amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. 

the fairy turned to set ""and what is your wish, set?""
set responded ""i never want to be poor again! i wish for money!""

""very well,"" said the fairy. smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. ""greetings, sirs! my name is elmon, and i am here to serve!""

""elmon is an expert in all things money,"" said the fairy, ""he will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.""

amenhotep and set were inseparable. true to his word, amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive amenhotep earned him the nickname ""imp"". with elmon's financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.  

years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, josep. 

ep and set's business expanded globally. 15 years passed and amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. set built a campus in cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. over the years, set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. 

as all fathers do, amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. he sent josep to the the hq in cairo to learn business from set. once there, josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of elmon, the elf.

josep spent months at hq learning how to run the business. while there, set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. he sent josep with the proposal to elmon to determine the financial logistics.

upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature's effect on set's fellow man, elmon keeled over and died, instantly.

josep was shocked, and ran to alert set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. in a rage, he accused josep of killing elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.

amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.

without the financial and legal savvy of elmon, set's case was a mess. amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. ""come, imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. let's use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.""

set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame josep for elmon's murder.

the case was brought before the court, but set's claims were weak and unsupported. the judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.

obviously, ep's teen didn't kill imp's elf.",0

"4 years ago today, i shared the worst joke i ever created. here it is again for those that missed it.. there are two identical twin brothers that live together. one happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. one saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. he tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. after some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. in the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. he turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
about 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. his vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. an ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. he ends up in the emergency room under observation, but his condition is critical. they try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
the dentist wakes to a knock on the door. suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. when he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. he is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
the grim reaper swears. ""oh no! this always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""what do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and i've come to take him to the underworld. i'm afraid his time on earth has ended. i'll take my leave now.""  
  
the dentist is noticeably upset. he says ""wait! isn't there some way i can challenge you for my brother's life? after all, you made the mistake. certainly there must be a way i can bargain for his life.""  
  
the grim reaper asks ""what do you have in mind?""  
  
the dentist thinks. ""how about a challenge? if i beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
the grim reaper laughs. ""i will beat you in any challenge. what challenge do you propose?""  
  
the dentist smiles. ""i propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. it's glistening. he takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. after 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. the grim reaper grins. ""you are foolish human. but, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
the dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. when his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. he smiles.  
  
it's unbelievable.  
  
the shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
the winner is obvious. the grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""you win, human. this time. your brother will live."" he disappears in a puff of smoke. at the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. it's his brother, the dentist. he picks up. ""hey bro. you'll never believe what happened. apparently, i went out to the market and got hit by a car. they say i almost died.""  
  
the dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""that's interesting, bro. today you might say that i also had a brush with death.""",0

"once upon a time there lived a beautiful queen with large breasts. nick the dragon slayer obsessed over the queen for this reason. he knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 


one day nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,horatio the physician, the king's chief doctor.horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. 


without pause nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

the next day, horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the queen's bra while she bathed. soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

upon being summoned to the royal chambers to address this incident, horatio informed the king and queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

the king, eager to help his queen, quickly summoned nick to their chambers. 

horatio then slipped nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, nick worked passionately on the queen's large and magnificent breasts. the queen's itching was eventually relieved, and nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

upon returning to his chamber, nick found horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. with his obsession now satisfied, nick couldn't have cared less knowing that horatio could never report this matter to the king and with a laugh told him to get lost.

the next day, horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the king's underwear. the king immediately summoned nick.

"a woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon..... a woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. as she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. 

after a moment or two, the vet 
shook his head and sadly said, ""i'm sorry, your duck, cuddles, has passed away.""

""are you sure?""

something.""

with a black labrador retriever. as the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. he then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 

the vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. a few minutes later he returned with a cat. the cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. the cat sat
back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. 

the vet looked at the woman and said, ""i'm sorry, but as i said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" 

the vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and 
produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

the bill would have been $20, but with the lab report and the cat scan, it's now $150.""

since she needed a good clean-up, i suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, i noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so i threw them away. then, as she needed clothes, i gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't wear because you say they are too tight.

i also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don't wear because i don't have good taste. i found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for christmas that you don't wear just to annoy her and i also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don't wear because someone at work has a pair the same.""

"there's a little-known legend about attila the hun.... the story goes that attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. he particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. he was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.


but his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.


wishing to save his prized pet, attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. none of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.


attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.


but the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. enraged, attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.


standing before attila, the old man calmly said, ""before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""


curious, attila did as he asked.


then the old man took some bread and gave it to attila.


""now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.


attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.


to an amazed attila, the old man simply said,

it is with great regret and sorrow that i'm writing you.

i had to elope with my new girlfriend, because i wanted to avoid a scene with mom and you.

i've been finding real passion with stacy.

she is so nice, but i knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than i am.

but it's not only the passion, dad.

she's pregnant.

stacy said that we will be very happy.

she owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.

we share a dream of having many more children.

stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

we'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

in the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for aids so that stacy can get better.

she sure deserves it!

don't worry dad, i'm 15, and i know how to take care of myself.

someday, i'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

love, your son, joshua.

completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""welp, i've been wrong all my life and i guess i'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""

satan laughs and replies: ""awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""

he then proceeds to escort jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.

as they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.

every time they stop to a house satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.

at sunset the devil sees that jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.

as they walk to jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and jack asks: ""what's behind there?""

satan: ""oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""

despite his curiosity jack thought better not to bother satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.

that night however jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.

after a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.

once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.

jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.

on the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.

jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.

the following morning satan showed up once again and told jack to come with him.

jack pleaded: ""please! please! don't take me to hell, i'll do anything just let me stay here, i don't wanna burn for all eternity!""

satan: ""what are you talking about??? i'm just gonna show you the recreational center like i told you yesterday""

jack: ""don't lie to me, i saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""

satan: ""ooooh you saw that! don't worry  that's not for you, that's the christian hell""

jack: ""the christian hell? why would the christian hell be like that?""

satan: ""i don't know either man, they just want it that way""

to her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check.
""there's no charge,"" he says.
""no, really, i must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit!"" she says.
""honestly, ma'am,"" the mortician says, ""it cost nothing. you see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. i asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.

"man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there.. he wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""you're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""but you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

all of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. the man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. when the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. only then does the man realize how hungry he is. a guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

the beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""that one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. all the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. i've heard the food is better there.""

so the man gets his food. it's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. the guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. it's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. all the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. and to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""what are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. the beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. when the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. on a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. a cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. the beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""that's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" the man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

while he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""the best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. you can never get tired of it!""

sadly, this proved not to be true. after only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. but he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. this time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. after ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. he went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

and wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. the man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""come,"" the beggar told him, ""i'll take you to the evening meal."" so the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. and sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. one of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""that's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals four times a year!""

the man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. four changes a year was enough for him. but one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""what is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what i have here?"" that question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. he was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. when he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. the architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. to his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

the beggar laughed jovially. ""i got here only three years ago myself, but somehow i knew you would be right here behind me. i've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. the room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. an angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""that's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""what is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

the beggar replied, ""there appears to be no punchline.""
