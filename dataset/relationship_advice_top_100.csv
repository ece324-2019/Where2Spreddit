[UPDATE]: My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.,"First of all thank you so much for all the replies, I didnt think this would get so big. I have read pretty much all of them (special shout out goes to the person who says this was fake solely on the fact that I write like a man, whatever that means XD)

Also thanks for all the gold and silver, it's appreciated although if you wanna spend money give it to charity or something.

&#x200B;

I went and talked to him this morning I told him that his father is not going to look at me and he needs to respect that. He was adamant that it needs to happen and accused me about lying about my virginity. I was trying to be calm and rational but he was not having it and just became more and more angry. I told him if he really loved me he would stand by me on this and tell his father no to which he slapped me and said he didnt need to prove anything.

so I ended it and left him. I am currently back at my friends house being miserable and eating pizza which is pretty fun. 

so yup. Thanks everyone :)",relationship_advice
"[update] my [32M] best friend [30 F] asked if I would be her sperm donor for her surrogate, I am in love with her but sje has no idea.","I appreciate all the feedback, most of you were nice. There was a few idiots telling me I needed to be Alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. 

Anyway the consensus with my RL friends was I needed to tell her. We do Brunch on Saturdays because she does Yoga Sundays so we met up this morning. 

I could barely eat and she could tell something was up. She got worried thinking I was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

I sat her down and told her everything how I realized I was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. I told her that I never said anything because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship. Her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

I honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and I honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      Then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. She half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

We hugged and I told her that there is no one on this earth I would want to have a child with but her. We talked for hours ,in fact I just got home. We have decided that we want to focus on us for now. I want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

I know that this isn't a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

However I am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

Thank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her

I (M28) broke up with my ex-fiancée (F27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. I am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.,"Hey guys,

I need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

A little background: 

Me and my ex-fiancée had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

Back in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

It all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

Imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

Heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

Everything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""Sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fiancée at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

When i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

She cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

I told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

I did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancée had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

I am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancée friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

I am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",relationship_advice
"Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.","Update 3:

Hey guys, and update has already been posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccpwcu/update_mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am/). Please don't message me so angrily any more.

Update 2:

Sorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.

Nothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. Regardless, I think I will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.

My sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and I have her support.

I promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now I need to support my grandma.

Thank you again to everyone.

Update:

Sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

Managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but I chickened out half way through what I had to say :(

The good news is that I am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

Thank you for all your support, everyone, I will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

My grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

I will let you know how I manage.

Thank you again.

Pretty much the title. I have no idea how to process all this, and I am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

Both my older brother and sister went to the same college. My brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. Both had their college paid by our dad. Dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

My brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

My sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

I got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. I always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

Instead I was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how I am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

Dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. He said it was never is place to say anything since I am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

Apparently my grandparents know I am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

My siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as I am because there was never a hint of anything being off. I might be naive, but I always thought I had a great relationship with my dad. We go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when I had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. I never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. I mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. It's a story he tells from time to time. He likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

My mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

I feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. I am not even sure I will be able to go to college any more, I always assumed my parents will pay for it. I never had a job, and I am not sure what job I can even get to support me through college, I have no idea how to apply for loans.

All my mom has done is cry and apologize. But nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

I don't even know if I am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, I feel shame leaving my room, and if I will be asked to move out I don't know where to go. I don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

I am angry at my mom, I am confused about where I stand with my dad. There's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. I feel rejected and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

Anyone have any idea what to do here?

Do I apologize to my dad? What do I say to him?

Idk, I've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. I have no idea what to do.

"HAPPY UPDATE: It has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34F) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. I (35M) am seriously considering a divorce.","ORIGINAL POST: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b1982e/it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we\_learned\_that\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1982e/it_has_been_7_months_since_we_learned_that_my/)

Hi all. First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.

The night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""Dear \[Wife's name\],

I love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I'm doing my best to help you but the fact that you won't help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don't make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I'm ready to talk whenever you are.

With all my love,

\[My name\]""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her ""I love you so, so, much"", and started crying too. I honestly don't know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could've been 10 minutes, it could've been an hour, I didn't care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don't know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words ""I really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.""

I was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She's always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

We're not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

EDIT: I'm going to bed. Thank you to everyone who followed my story and offered their well wishes.",relationship_advice
[Update] I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I talked to her.,"I would like to preface this post with an apology. I know it has been nearly three weeks since I last posted. To be honest, in no world did I ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. I've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. Not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original It, I have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. For that, I am sorry.

For the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. It is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

For the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a Greek tragedy, I apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

Now to start where things left off.

After making my original post, I combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a Plan B box and thrown it into the garbage. A lot of them made sense. My greatest hope was that it might have just been old. Maybe it was before we even met. Clinging to that, I hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. I'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what I would say in response, and what I would do. I memorized them all.

On the evening after I made my original post, I called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. As I had practiced, I asked her the following question:

>Hey, I'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? 

The second the words ""Plan B"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. She was completely lost for words. I already knew at that point. I retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>Why was there a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? You know I had a vasectomy. 

She just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. Then she looked to the floor. Then she started weakly sobbing. 

This was not on the flowchart. I had no idea how to respond. I thought if I let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. Finally I prompted her with another question:

>Are you crying because you did something you regret?

She shook her head violently. I was so concerned because I thought something horrendous might have happened.

She abruptly shrieked ""I'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" I have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

So I prompted her again. 

>Just tell me why it was there. You don't have to hide anything from me.

She yelled at me again. Repeatedly. ""If you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""Fuck you for not trusting me.""

This line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. I refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, I wasn't budging an inch. She then informed me that either I had to leave or she would leave. Since I doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), I agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. I went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

The following night, I texted her asking if she was ready to talk. She was not. Instead, she gave me an ultimatum: I had to [1] apologize, [2] promise to never bring it up again, and [3] learn to trust her completely. Only then would she allow me back home. If I couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

I have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. I am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. I currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. The lawyer will probably tell me I'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

There is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. I am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. None of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. I'm holding off on saying anything until I'm calm and rational and won't do something I'll regret in the future.

**tl;dr** yes, she cheated, yes, the marriage is over, and yes, I feel awful about it. ",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] My grandparents don't approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don't want me (F24) to marry him (26). I don't know what to do, since I don't want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).","Hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my [previous post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

It was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that I come clean to Sam. I did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. I asked him how he's taking it so well and he told me he's experienced something similar before. 

His cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. He told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. They wouldn't allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he ""got his head straight"". 

He then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. He told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

Sam joked that he wouldn't give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they'd be in love with him. 

Well I think it's working. Sam and I have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night I notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. Sam and my grandpa are both WW2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with Sam. 

I decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. I got there before Sam, and I could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought I had come alone_. They asked where Sam was, when he was coming etc. Then they said we wouldn't start eating until he arrived.

"Update : Wife (38F) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and ""our twins""","It has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.

[^((Original Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

I called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . He seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  He said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. I sat her down and we talked. All she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . I tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. I asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. She said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. Now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . So I did. She kept changing subjects or saying that "" A mother just feels it. You wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". She got very agitated and was crying telling me that if I wanted to leave her i should simply leave but I shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200B;

Somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

After she did i went on her computer. I do **never** snoop on her. But i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . Oh boy. She was in 2 facebook groups. One was a normal Mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. In the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. They were feeding in each others delusions. A woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. My wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. So many women were making her fear that i would leave. Saying things like men can not stick to a woman . Many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

I was really fucking scared. I researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361851/). So to say the least i could not sleep. I was and am still very afraid of losing her. She woke up and I tried to act like nothing was wrong . We were going to the doctor. And it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. She was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. Things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. He was really tactful when talking to my wife. He tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. We tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. She got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . She began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . We could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . She could not breathe. The doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . She had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. Did an EKG to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

At that point i really had no other option than to inquire about Involuntary commit. So I could not do it myself . I needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . After that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". So far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . My wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. When i last her she was furious with me. She said i was taking away her freedom which I am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. She is so mad at me. I feel like I am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. I love her with all my heart. I am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . I feel like i failed to protect her. At this point I am just rambeling . Sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . I feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . Sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : I will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! When I gave my vows I meant trough illness and bad times. I am not only on the ride for the good times. If you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. Would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? I am here to stay. I will not divorce her. She is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. I hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

Sorry for the rant. But if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. I understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it Beginns to mess with their mental health  and I respect that but I won't do that.

Edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. She was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

I don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as I was so distraught. But I was not a sedative. I think it was something along the lines of Valium or Baldrian. Over the counter stuff mostly.

She has family. She is estranged from most of them. Her sister is now at our place to help.

Also refrain from such stupid comments like ""I'll bet she will leave bro. She is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. Specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. Just seems like you want me to divorce. Get a life.",relationship_advice
My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.,"My fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. We decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. Everything was going great. He seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

I am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and I wasn't fussed so I agreed to saving it. He has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. I laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. No turns out he was dead serious. He wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know I am still 'pure'.

I told him fat chance I am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. He said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much I love him and that I have nothing to hide anyway as I am still a virgin. I left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

I want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. But at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and I dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

What the frick frack do I do. I am currently at my friends house and I might stay here for the night. tomorrow would be our last day as an unmarried couple and I am straight up panicking.",relationship_advice
I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.,"Throwaway, because reasons.

TL;DR: Found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. Asked girlfriend about it. She started yelling at me and crying and left.

I don't even know where to start with this. I'm dumbfounded. She just stormed out the house and I'm sitting on the bed asking myself A LOT of questions.

I live a pretty normal life, and I thought so did my girlfriend. We've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. We started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. She would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. I'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. I always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, I wouldn't stop her.

This is where it takes a turn for the weird. I keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. I also go to the gym frequently, so I always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. I never kept count, but I know by just a visual glance I several pairs. This morning when I went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, I noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. Again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. I went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so I checked the washing machine and dryer. Both were empty. I couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. So, I did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. After all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. She went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. When I went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. I told her I wasn't mad, I was just looking for my socks. She kinda mumbled ""I'll don't know."" I still wasn't mad, of course, but I was super confused. Socks just don't disappear. So I asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""I'll buy you new ones!""

The first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. I thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so I joked with her about ruining my socks. Wrong. Thing. To. Say. She started immediately crying. Like, full on sobbing. At this point I don't care about the socks anymore, I want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. I sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. She just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. I tried assuring her again it was okay. Even went so far as to say I would buy new socks and she didn't have to. I sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. I told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

On my way out I grabbed the garbage to take outside. When I got outside I lifted the lid off the garbage can and I noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. I could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. Since I was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, I wanted to see for myself. I opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. There, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. As soon as the smell hit me I knew it WAS POOP.

1. We don't own any pets.
2. We don't have any kids.
3. WHOSE POOP WAS ON MY SOCKS?

Work could wait. I couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. I grabbed the bag and walked back inside. As soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. She said I shouldn't be going through the garbage and that I was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. I asked her to calm down and that I just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. I wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. That's when it clicked. I don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. I asked her ""Is this your poop?"" She started sobbing again and ran out of the house. I didn't go after her this time.

So, now I am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. The only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. Which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. I sent her text asking her to come back. She hasn't responded yet. I don't even know what I'm going to say when (IF) she gets back.

UPDATE:

I had to leave for work and am now at work. Yes, I threw away the bag of poopy socks. She texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. She said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to NOT bring it up in person. I'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as I can. Her responses are super short, but I'm getting the idea.

I flat out asked her if it was a fetish. It is not a fetish. She confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. I found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. I had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? She thought I would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. She admitted she has done this for a long time. Her reasoning, as best as I can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in ANY WAY. She uses socks because it covers her entire hand. After she's done with them, she throws them away. She used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

So, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. It could be worse, I guess. I hope we can laugh about this later. I'm trying to find the humor in it now, but I'm still weirded out.

Me [52M] just found out at least 4 of my 5 children [33F][30F][28M][24F][14F] are not mine. Wife [51F] wont say anything.,"***Note: Please do not use ancestry kits as a paternity test. If you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local MedLab (medical lab). Ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. In my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.***

--------------

I apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on r/parenting. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

First of all, I'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

Background: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I've done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

Now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and I'll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.

This news really broke me. I'm ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn't.

Following this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

We tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I'll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn't care I wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

So we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

So I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn't confess. She doesn't even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?

I keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""We've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

Now that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. How can I reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.

2. How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but I also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. If there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

Edit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. Again, I can't begin to thank you for all your support. If this is resolved I might post an update, but if she continues to lie then I don't think I'll bother, as there's not much more I can add. From the advice in this and the r/parenting thread I've decided to:

1. Get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. Confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. Tell my youngest of the situation. Ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. It will be entirely her decision.

4. I'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. My mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and I owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. Depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), I have not ruled out some form of counselling. But at the moment I think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. Contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

Once again I'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

Edit2: I guess I should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **How did the ancestry results suggests I wasn't her father?** My family is entirely Irish. No relatives outside of Ireland other than my immediate family, and I even have the stereotypical red hair. My daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the British isles/western Europe/northern Europe. That's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **Which two children share the same father?** My two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **How did your wife conceive your children?** Our eldest daughter was not planned. All the others were planned. Each time we conceived several months after we started trying. Our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. She was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually I agreed. She was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **Are you infertile?** I don't know. I've never had a fertility test done. But the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that I might be. I will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

[31M] Husband cheated on [27F] me with his fit and skinny gym friend,"I came home from work early (I'm an OB nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. At that point, I sort of already knew what I'd be walking into. My husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. She's beautiful and thin and everything I am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. So, I talked to him about it. He encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

I walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. They were having sex. In our bed. With a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. I silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. Its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and I've returned to the hospital. He called me asking why I wasn't home and I told him my shift is extended but in reality, I'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as I type this.

I feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. I don't even know how to proceed. On one hand I want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, I'm an ugly woman....its not like I can do better. I just want to die. I feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. Advice please.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments and support. Please stop commenting, however. I think I've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). I don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. Reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. I still have no idea what I am going to do and I know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. He was a great husband and I can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. I don't know if I will stay, but that's all I really know right now.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while I'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how I should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. It is incredibly upsetting and I am already going through a lot. I feel I need to clarify since everyone seems to care that I had food after I found out. I had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which I had been all over the place. I had lunch at 11am and nothing else until I left. I was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. Please stop harassing me about that.",relationship_advice
Update: My sister (F22) ripped up my(F19) Stan Lee autograph and I haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (F46) is pressuring me to,"Thanks for the great advice. So a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

My grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

I explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who Stan Lee was. Surprisingly she understood just perfectly. I was relieved. For a moment I thought that my dad and I would get shit from everyone.
My sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". I told her that she asked me and I just told the truth.

But what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. She again ridiculed my hobby and so on. One of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. The dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. She is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

My mom and sister came back in the morning. They didn't talk much to us . My mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. We had a short dry conversation till she asked me why I was making such a big deal about it. And I shut her up like you guys told me to. I started by explain who Stan Lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. It's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. You said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because I didn't lend her my jacket ""

Ya'll my mom cried. She apologized profusely. She said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as I was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

My mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.","The reaction to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

I am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

Unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and I am still processing it.

I did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and I know where I now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

I am not sure I would have had the courage to say what I had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

I think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. A lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

I have so far went through 40% (I estimate) of the comments, but I have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

The conclusion is that I am definitely going to college, it will be the college I have always wanted to go to, and I will have the same experience as my siblings. The money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

Even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

What started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then I showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

My parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when I came back pregnant"", or something like that, I was not there, this is what she told me. I guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision I ever made"" or something like that. And their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

Yeah, it went downhill from there fast. Shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here I am.

Dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

I did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. My brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

My grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, I guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

Reading the comments was a mind opening experience. I felt unprepared for the world out there. Many have asked how I had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. Well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. Of course I knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

I went from ""I am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and I will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

Others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. For me it was a sudden change in reality.

Going through the comments I managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. Really good stuff that I think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

My parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and I haven't even read all comments. I can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

Dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. I understand his reaction, but I still feel hurt by it. I understand he was not in the best place of mind, but I can't control my feelings either. We will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

Mom hasn't handled everything that well. But she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

When mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. Mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. He kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. So my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (I am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). Mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

The man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. Dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. He was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, I guess he had more important things to do. But it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

And I don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. I thought about the matter the last two weeks, since I've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if I have other siblings out there.

I was suggested to go and buy a DNA kit from 23andme, maybe I can find him that way, but I think I will avoid doing this specifically so I don't find him or he finds me. As far as I care, I have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

Moving forward I do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like I would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

My mom admits I've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

I did learn where I stand with my family, and it's safe to say that I am loved, and I have options. I thought I am isolated, but my world is wider than I thought. Grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

I think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, I think I will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

Thank you.

Edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. Stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"Orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**TL;DR:** Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.

Update **TL;DR** at bottom

First I just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  I can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

I took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  I had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  It wasn't until I got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that I was able to try and move on.  My wife and I actually met in a soccer league we were in together. We've had so much trust for so long that I thought those fears had gone away.  It wasn't until now that I really started to feel shaken like that again.

But I didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  A few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

It's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. I didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  I got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. I couldn't wait any longer.  I made our favorite omelets, and told her I needed to talk about something.

""You know I'm not Ashley, right?""

She knows me well.  Ashley's my ex who cheated.

So first I apologized.  I apologized because I let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  What should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

We talked for a while.  I told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. I told her how much I loved the relationship that we've built together, and I felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  She had never given me a reason not to trust her and that I still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  She thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  She volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

But something still felt off.  I honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  Normally she would have been upset that I didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling I couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

It seemed like she was saying all the right things, but I couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid.  Maybe there's a gut feeling that I need to listen to.  But I ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if I still needed the surgery.

Turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  I've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. So I brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. The urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that I wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. He mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

Being there didn't really help.  I feel like I just got more uncertainty.  

She had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  We talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. She seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. She promised to do it in the morning.  I asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

There's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  I really couldn't put my finger on it.  We were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and I couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had Sunday.

I've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but I haven't been able to focus.  We have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  This morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. We don't do that, she's never needed to before.  And I checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time Thursday that I mentioned I was busy working on-site. We were supposed to go together.

I'm starting to go crazy. How do I bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  I'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  But I need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if I'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**TL;DR Had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  Urologist said I had obstructive azoospermia, implied I should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think I could be fertile.  Wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when I can't go.  Getting a second Urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

UPDATE:  I've been trying to center myself.  We talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  She claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  I didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  I'm just trying to not overreact right now. I don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and Im a Father! Or...not.  Thankfully she's not working late today.  

Thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

UPDATE:  I went for a long run to clear my mind.  Gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  I'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why I've still been struggling personally with some of them.  Regardless of what happens I'm done with any confusion left between us.

  Thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

"Yesterday, my(33m) wife's (34f) best friend (female) contacted me and told me that her husband and my wife were having an affair and my 3yo daughter is actually his daughter.","Wife and I have been together since high school. Married for 10 years. I'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. 

My wife's best friend Megan and I work for the same company( different departments ). So yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. So I met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. I tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. 

According to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. She confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. 

And when I confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when I told her that Megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. 

I really don't know what to do. I mean, everything was a lie right? My little girl Taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. What do I live for now? I just don't know what to do. Just here for some advice. I'm sorry if this felt like a rant.",relationship_advice
"UPDATE: My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but I'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. Do I say anything?","Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

So I got lots of feedback on what to do here. A good majority of the commenters told me to say something. To clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but I was never planning on doing nothing. Of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. I just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

Some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. Some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which I ended up getting from Alison, the third party friend. Some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me I was a bad friend. Some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. Well all of you were somewhat right. Here's how it went down: 

I messaged Alison early on in the day, shortly after I made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. I said to Alison that I needed to tell Aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. This was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

Aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that Alison came over too. We all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about Mary. Alison showed him the text screenshots of Mary talking to her ex, and also told Aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

What was the most surprising was his reaction. He took it very well. He first got very quiet, and just nodded. Aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. He was not aware of the hookups, but he and Mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. He told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. There were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. He knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

We started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. He cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. Then he got angry. At her, and even more so at the guy. Some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

Ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. We told him a million times how much better he deserved. He's definitely not going to marry her. 

Thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. We saved a good man from heartbreak!

Edit: Jesus Christ this exploded fast. Thanks for all the kind words people 😅",relationship_advice
HAPPY UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

I'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  I definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what I posted.  But hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes I guess.

Anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  I told her everything that was going on.  The Urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  I told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

She agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  She didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  She knew I was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. We talked about it Sunday, but I can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  And so while she had thought we were communicating, I wasn't.  We decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

The money was the real problem for me. She agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  Apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  She offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if I really wanted we could move the money back.  She does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

We read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  It seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. We're going to go back to the original specialist I was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  It turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  I told her I took off work to go with, and she was relieved I could join.

Once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  After going through each thing I was just wishing I believed her a little more before. She's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. She even offered an open phone policy if I needed.  We did look at the text I had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  I declined though right now, since I don't want to be that husband.

This has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. Even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  That level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  I think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. I was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  This has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but I'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  I'm not big on therapy, but I can probably agree that it will most likely help.

I'm feeling a little better about everything.  Thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (Every other comment here I read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   It's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**TL;DR  Use your words. - Wife and I objectively went through everything.  We both apologized, getting a NIPP soon and hopefully a therapist.**

TLDR: Mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.


I just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update.

A few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she's clear!).

She went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out.

They went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

When she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

We took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

She's amazing, man. Seriously.


Update on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

My GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

I told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said ""How Jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

My GF didn't find it funny...

Anyway, that's it.


Good luck to everyone in their lives.

Also, if you're going to message and insult me via PM, just be warned: I've killed ^a ^baby before.",relationship_advice

I dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. So here's what happened. 

-She texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 PM (she's closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-I tried to facetime her 11:51 PM just to say goodnight, she didn't pick up. I tried messaging her but no response. 

Remember that spare phone that's with me where her google account is logged in? I browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there's a ""google assistant"" command recorded at 11:48 PM.

I played and listened. There's her voice and a voice of another guy. They were goofing around at the google home device. So yeah. 

I confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 AM.  She kept on denying she's cheating.

Then I laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

She finally admitted. 

I am single.

Can't wait until Thursday....My(48M) wife(44F) is going to be SHOCKED,"[**\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

So, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.

Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......

I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

Fast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

Our ""New"" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.

Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.

\*Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING.  So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then.  (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from ""How I Met Your Mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*Edit 3 - And to those of you saying ""I"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  She is my hero.  I wake up every day to earn her all over again.  This was one small thing I was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why I have a heartbeat.  And I don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if I seem sappy.  If a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

TL;DR Wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, I went Hardy Boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  Was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

"UPDATE: My childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now he's being ostracized from our friends.

#That ""Half Blurred Nude"" everyone's talking about is Rick Astley. Please, go ahead and ""depixelize"" it or whatever. 

#The other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. Please read the post before commenting.

So a couple things have happened in the last few days, and I figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

First, I'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. He is just as much a victim of a crime as I am, if not more. This has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. He is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

It's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

I spoke to a lawyer...and my Dad. The lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **If** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

Anyways. Monday, I got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. The first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". She would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

In my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *Fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. It also matters that there are two victims.

The police spoke to the people whose names I provided, most of which confirmed that Sarah had shared the photos. They'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

That all made both me and John happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(All of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

So I turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. I spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. Then I paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""UNDER CONSTRUCTION"". Then I registered John and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""CONTENT PENDING COPYRIGHTS"".

THEN. I posted on Facebook.

""Recently, someone I consider a friend broke into John's phone and stole images. She then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

Not only am I disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed John in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. This person DID NOT come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

Had I ACTUALLY been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. How horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

In actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""Stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

Most of you know me as an entrepreneur; I own a small business, I pick up freelance jobs, I dabble in several money making ventures. None of this is a consistent income, so John and I have been brainstorming on how I could possibly generate a passive income. 

So we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. We had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and John's name was dragged through the dirt.

Shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

Because of this person and ALL who participated, I have had to out John and myself as sex workers. I've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn DAD. Shame on all of you.

From this point on, any person sharing these COPYRIGHTED images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

If anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

Thank you.""

Since then, I've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on Facebook.

Sarah tried to call but I hit ignore and texted her, ""You may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. She hasn't responded.

All in all, I'd say that things are looking up. Sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. John's name is clear legally. Important people in my life know that I'm not being abused. 

People are reaching out to John to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

So that's good, I guess.

I want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

Edit: To everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

I submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

Y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. I wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

I was, an still am, angry. So I got shit done.

*Edit edit*: **I am not releasing the videos.**

**Another Edit**: Since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, [this is where I got my information](https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#Final Edit:

This is getting out of hand so I'll be logging off. People asked for an update, so they got it.

Copied from a comment I posted:

Nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting Sarah arrested.

My lawyer told me that, no, John could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, I could go ahead and post on Facebook to try to control the narrative. 

He *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. As of now, I've achieved everything I wished to do. The police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

I don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",relationship_advice

Final Update:

I first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. I got a lot more responses than I had thought I would, so I apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

My sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on September 1st. It's been a very hard couple of days and I've been grieving, as has my family. 

We were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. I was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. She was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

I wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. She normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. We will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

My family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. She will always be in our hearts and I know she's in a better place and not in pain. 

Thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice I was given.",relationship_advice
My (20F) boyfriend (21M) wouldn't pay for my meal when I forgot my wallet,"Basically the title. 

Usually on dates, we split the bill. I don't really care like in the past, I've paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. Like we'd go back and forth. 

My current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. From the first date, he said that's how he likes to do things. I was fine with it, I didn't  really care if he wouldn't pay for me. Paying on a date is sweet to me and I like it but I have my own job so it's whatever. I figured maybe he doesn't have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

Anyway I didn't really have any problem with it. But we went out to some random spot. Like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. So he went down the line and he got his own meal. I ordered mine and then when I went into my bag, I realized I forgot my wallet at my house. I told him that I forgot it by accident and I thought he'd offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like ""oh that sucks..."" and sat down to eat. 

I was just like what the fuck..? This guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and I paid him back through cashapp. After we ate, I lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city. 

How messed up is that? Like why is he so cheap. A random stranger paid for me and he wouldn't",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I (20F) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27M) phone.,"It's been a long night. Thank you all for staying patient. Also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

First off I just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. I'm still trying to work through all of your PM's because I'd like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. I have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. I never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it's my hope that if I can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice I used from Reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon CP and find this thread (at least in Canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

I also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, I understand. This is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as I wish I had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary Karma, I don't. To provide proof I have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what I have written.

Yesterday I was picked up by my best friend Alex around 2:30. We drove around and talked for a while. I went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. We drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

Alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. David was home, in my room, and immediately I noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. He said he had to admit something to me. I prepared for him to admit to possessing CP but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn't know how to bring it up. I feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. He  said no. I asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. I don't know why I was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the CP but I really thought he'd admit to it then and there. Instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn't think he would act on it. He asked me if that changed my perception of him and I said no. He grew quiet again and I left to go shower. When I came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. It was about 1030 at this point. When he left, I finally lost it and broke down. I grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. I was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

I grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency RCMP line for my city. Shaking and crying I explained to the lady on the phone that I had discovered CP on my boyfriend's phone. She put me through to the report line and I spoke to another Constable who told me I would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. I waited for around 10 minutes. The officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. I asked if I could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, Crown Counsel has clear evidence that I was not coerced into stating what I witnessed. I don't have my full licence yet and because of the late time I wasn't able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if David was there and if I could safely leave without arousing suspicion. Luckily David knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so I made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. David didn't seem to question it and I waited for the officer to arrive. 

He called me from a blocked number and I walked outside and down the block to his SUV. The constable and another officer greeted me,  I got into the front seat and we drove to the station. During the ride I asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. He explained that I had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying David. He said if I had taken David's phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. It was about 11:15 at this point. They placed me in an interview room and I sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. The officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. He said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 He started off by asking me details about my life, where I grew up, past employment etc. After that portion he asked me about David, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else I knew about him. I told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we'd been together but I did express that things had been moving very quickly. He agreed. He then got me to explain how I came upon the photos in question, so I did. Then came the worst part. He asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos I explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. It was intense but by some grace of God I was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and I was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. He asked me if I would testify in court and I said I would. The officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. The full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

After I had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. They explained how the process would go and whether I wanted a no contact agreement.  I said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. That made sense to me so I chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

We got in the constable's car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. I told them I was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (I didn't want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. I've never felt so anxious in my life. I asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. About 15 minutes later I saw them bringing David out in handcuffs. My heart which had been dissolving in my stomach's acid all day felt completely gone. I curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told I could go back inside. After another eternity (my phone had died by this point but I know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. I was told by the officer I could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. The officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that I did a brave thing and to be well. 

I went back into my house, put Planet Earth on for background noise and called my other best friend Paige who had been keeping up with me about this since I sent her my reddit post. We were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. It was David. He was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. My jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and I was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. Paige asked me if everything was okay and I told her David had walked through the door, I would call her back. Immediately David came to the bed where I was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. He said he didn't know I would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. He asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. I lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. He sobbed more and loudly said ""That isn't me, that isn't me, this isn't who I am"" and cried more and more. His body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. It was immensely difficult to witness and I wish I could have told him to get the fuck out but I just sat there immobilized, in shock. It was well close to 5 in the morning and I hadn't slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

David began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. I asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. He said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. I asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. He said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. I nodded. I asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. He admitted they were very explicit photos and I asked how he even found them; I don't recall we ever got to that. He promised me he didn't use my internet to access it but I don't really believe that. He apologized to me more times than I could count and asked if I hated him. I told him I wasn't sure that I felt hatred for him but I was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; I told him how terribly I felt betrayed and hurt and violated. I expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

Then I heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. Three officers were outside, two of whom I recognized from earlier and they asked me if David was here. I said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because Paige had called in. I realized I had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know I was okay, bless her heart. The officers took David outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. I told them I was okay; that I would finish my discussion with him and if I had any issues I had them on speed dial. They nodded and left. 

David sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and I just sat and well, endured it. Tears just ran and ran and ran from him. He said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure I expected to hear this great big apology. He said if I thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he'd done, but what I had to go through. I just nodded. There was silence for a long time, I think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. I don't know how long I stared at my TV screen that said ""Are you still watching: Planet Earth?"" but it could have been a lifetime. I had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. I think David was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. I didn't know or care, I was just numb. I would have probably sat like that until I died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. I got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. My brain wasn't capable of thought so I stared at my tv screen until I passed out sometime around 9. 

I didn't sleep for long because when I woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. David was awake and crying still. When he realized I was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. I just stared at him. He started apologizing and apologizing more. He expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that I was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. He expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. I shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. At this point I finally asked him to leave. I told him I needed space to sort out my emotions, and I needed to get some sleep.  I asked him if he would be okay. He nodded and grabbed his things. He said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that's what I wanted him to do. I said nothing. He expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. He said I love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

I've been laying in bed since then and writing this. I just want this to be over. I just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. Also I think I forgot to add that his court date is set for June. As far as sentencing, if he's found guilty of possession of child pornography I believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  I will post updates again if I feel  they are important; otherwise I will update again in June when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

Thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. I have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and I would have been so lost without some of your advice. I'll continue working on replying to your PM's, but in the meantime I think I'm going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

TLDR: Filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested David and seized his phone. He signed a promise to appear in court in June. He awaits sentencing.

"Wife told me she wanted to experiment, I obliged, then she attempted to eat my feces.","Throwaway account because my wife follows my regular account here. My (28m) wife (26f) and I have admittedly had very vanilla sex throughout our 3 year marriage. We had our first kid a year ago and it seriously slowed down our sex life. However, a little under a month ago she approached me about ""trying new things"". She has been hanging out with a group of moms in our neighborhood and one of them told her that she and her husband tried pegging and it completely transformed their marriage. My wife told me that she wanted to try pegging as well to ""spice things up"". At first I thought it was a joke, but soon realized she actually wanted to peg me. I had never done assplay before and had always lived by the philosophy that the anus is solely an exit, but my wife made it clear that this was important to her so after a few days I obliged.

That next weekend, she pegged me and everything was surprisingly enjoyable. Additionally, the week following the pegging was one of the best weeks we've had together since the birth of our child. We were back to our old sex life, doing things like having sex before work and even waking each other up with head. However, that next weekend she told me she wanted to peg me again. I was slightly confused as to why this last week of sex wasn't cutting it for her, but I agreed.

This is when things took an extreme turn. During this second pegging while my wife was inside of me, she grabbed my hair, craned my neck to the right, and pressed our foreheads together. I had never seen her take control like this and thought it was very hot until she looked me in the eye and whispered ""I want your shit"". I pulled my face away and asked her to repeat and she said ""I want you to shit on me"". I pushed her off of me and asked her if she was joking and she started crying. I felt like a fucking dick because she thought I was kinkshaming her. In a way, I was because I thought the request was far too extreme. I ended up leaving for the night and stayed with one of my close friends, but didn't tell him what happened.

After that incident, my wife and I hardly talked all week unless it related to our son. At the end of the week, I asked my wife to talk about what happened. She told me again that she wanted me to shit on her and that it meant a lot to her. I thought it was sickening, but she claimed this was her deepest, darkest kink. I couldn't understand how and why my shit excited her, but she insisted that she has always wanted this.

We fought about this for about a week and after watching some scat porn and reading articles by people who also shared this kink, I tried to put myself in my wife's shoes. I told her that I will shit on her if that is what will turn her on. She was so happy and even though I was still completely nauseated by this desire, I wanted to satisfy her.

That brings us to tonight. We were having sex for the first time this week when I (regrettably) confessed to her that I had to take a shit. She perked up with a smile, sensed my discomfort, and began stroking my hair and whispering encouraging things to me. I still really didn't want to go through with it, but since I had promised her I pulled out and we ran to the bathroom.

She got into the bathtub and I hung my ass over the side of the tub. I started pushing, but unsurprisingly found it very difficult to successfully shit on my wife. I turned my head around to see my wife staring up and smiling at me waiting for me to finish. With enough time, I was finally able to get a turd to start coming out. I could hear my wife breathing heavier beneath me as my asshole started opening. However, before the turd was able to drop on her chest, I felt a sensation around my asshole.

I turned around and saw my wife - the love of my life, the mother of my son - attempting to catch my turd in her mouth as it fell out of my asshole. I was horrified that she would try to do this, and tried to pull the shit back into my body so she couldn't receive it in her mouth. Seeing what looked like an attempt by her to eat my shit brought me close to throwing up.

As I clenched my buttcheeks together to try to stop the shit from reaching my wife, the clenching cut off a very small piece of my shit and I heard it land somewhere beneath me. I was too scared and disgusted to look at my wife to see what she had done with it, so I ran to the other bathroom to clean myself. As I was sitting in the other bathroom thinking about how I will ever be able to look my wife in the eye again, I heard footsteps approaching. My wife lightly knocked on the door. I didn't respond and was on the verge of throwing up the more I thought about what just happened. She walked away and then I got a text from her thanking me for fulfilling her wish and asking me to come to bed.

I've been sitting in the living room typing this for the last half hour scared to face my wife. We have plans to take our son to the zoo with another family tomorrow, but I don't think I can look at her after what she did to me. I feel deceived and violated by the woman I love and trust. During our initial conversations about this, there was never a question that my shit would go anywhere other than her chest. She knew how uncomfortable I was with this in the first place, yet she still tried to push the boundary that we had established.

I would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a similar violation of trust from a loved one. I'm turning to this sub for advice because for obvious reasons, I cannot tell anyone that knows my wife and I. I know that some of you may find this humorous, but please serious comments only - this is something that could lead to the end of our marriage.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: I didn't expect this to go to the front page, but my wife has seen the post. I have been unable to face her and there is no way to get out of going to the zoo with the other family today.  I appreciate all the serious feedback and I will update tonight.",relationship_advice
I think I got reverse catfished last night,"I matched with this girl on Tinder. She was significantly bigger than girls I normally date. But we have literally everything thing in common so I figured I'd give it a shot. So after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

I get there and pick a table. After waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. That's very strange so I assume she must be after something. Free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, I don't know.

So I explain to her that I'm actually waiting for someone and I don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

That's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one I'm waiting for. She told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

And she was also testing me to see if I would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. So here's the thing, I don't know how I feel about being ""tested"". I don't want to live my life questioning every decision I make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

But she's also really attractive and very cool otherwise. I'm not sure how I should proceed.

Edit: I didn't expect this to be downvoted so much. I guess people just prefer the standard ""I just walked in on my fiancé and my father, brother, and best friend all had their penis' inside her at the same time. Should I still go through with the wedding?""",relationship_advice

Super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

I wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love I received from people in this sub I feel like the least I can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. Before I begin I just want to thank everyone who gave advice, I didn't respond to everyone but I read almost every response. I stopped reading my Pm's because a lot of the messages I was getting were graphic and negative but I appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you. Now on to the update: 

It's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. My bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time I decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. I felt like everything I needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. His sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

We spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. He told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while I was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when I first suggested it. He said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (I don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when I brought up his tattoo. Obviously I knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but I must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because I never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

I was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. He regrets the tattoo and discovering I wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. Truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. He apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. He completely understood where I was coming from when I brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

I apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. Initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what I meant and was very forgiving. He apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

We then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

Up until now I was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. Not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. Apparently she felt like I was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

If that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. Not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. We're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

My bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. She was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. We've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

In the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. In the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. Bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. I'm a fan of this idea as well. 

As for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. I don't think he should, I feel like he's lost enough family but I'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

I think that just about wraps everything up. A huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

I mean this in the nicest way possible when I say I hope I never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - We both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. Boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. We're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",relationship_advice
My wife (30F) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. I (30M) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. Our relationship is not sustainable and I need help.,"Hi, everyone. This will probably be lengthy as I have nobody in my life to talk to about this. This is as much an advice thread as it is a place for me vent and it feels good to air this out.

My wife suffers from intense germophobia and anxiety. We have been together for 11 years and married for 8. She has not always been like this, she was relatively normal while we dated but it started to get worse after we got married. She previously worked at a hotel as a receptionist and was occasionally required to handle and wash guest towels. Well, she ended up contracting a staph infection and had to be hospitalized to have the infection drained. Following this, she had to be on antibiotics for 30 days. Ever since that experience, her anxiety and fear of infection has steadily grown over the years up until this point. We also have two children - 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl - and her tendencies affect them, also.

The following list is my attempt at a comprehensive germ-prevention ""Standard Operating Procedures"" of our household:

&#x200B;

* If I touch a light switch I need to wash my hands
* If I touch a door knob I need to wash my hands
* If I go to the garage I need to take a shower before I      can sit down or do anything
* If I touch her pajamas or I touch towels then I need to      take a shower
* If I *even enter* the guest bathroom then I have      to take a shower
* If my kids enter the guest bathroom they have to have a      bath
* I am not allowed to use her toilet in the master      bathroom
* She stops up her toilet everyday and requires me to      plunge and clean it (she uses 3x as much TP as a regular person would).      The cleaning process is 3 Chlorox wipes - one for the seat, one for under,      and one to use to flush it with. I have to immediately shower after this.
* If she spills excess *water* on the floor then I      have to mop it and anywhere I walked to include the **entire** house if      that is where I walked after stepping in the water.
* She goes through entire loads of her pajamas daily just      trying to change her clothes. Every time she uses the toilet, she has to      change her clothes. She washes her hands and arms up to her elbows and      then her face. If she gets water on her shirt, she will change it. If,      when putting on her shirt she touches it to her body, she will change it.      If her pants touch the floor when she is putting them on, she will change      them. She discards the top shirts in her drawer every time she gets      dressed. She uses 6-7 towels after a shower, discarding half of them      because ""they touched my chest."" As you can see, this adds up      and I end up folding laundry for 60-90 minutes everyday. This doesnt      include the time it takes to actually change it out and take showers.
* If I change out laundry and **I graze the doorframe** when I enter the bedroom with clothes, I have to discard ALL OF THEM.
* If an article of clothing touches the edge of the bed, discard it.
* If I even *touch* the dishwasher I have to wash my      hands.
* If she takes a shower and gets in the bed, she will NOT      leave the bedroom or she considers herself dirty and would have to shower      again. This means if she is hungry or thirsty I will bring it to her.
* Her showers last around 40 minutes. She bathes 3-4      times and washes her hair 2 times. Our water bill is ridiculous.
* If my son (2 YO) takes one step outside of his playpen      then he has to have a bath before he can go in his bed. This includes      naps. If I take him outside (even just for *1 minutes*), he would      need a bath before he can get in his bed. Not even changing his clothes      would suffice.
* When I clean the house (which I dont mind, btw.      Cleaning your house is necessary), everything has to be done in a **very      specific order**. No deviations from this order or it has to be re done.

&#x200B;

1. Change out laundry and leave washer free
2. Wash hands, face, and arms and change clothes
3. Sanitize all toys on floor and put away
4. Pick up all clothes and put in baskets
5. Sanitize all counters
6. Clean kids bathroom
7. Take out master bathroom trash, wash hands, replace bag
8. Take out kids trash, wash hands, replace bag
9. Take out kitchen trash, wash hands, replace bag
10. Clean guest bathroom, wash hands, take out trash, wash      hands, replace bag
11. Take shower
12. Put bathroom rugs in washer
13. Take shower
14. Sweep entire house in a very specific order
15. Mop house in very specific order
16. Take shower

I want to make this clear - I have no problem with cleaning but I often do something in the wrong order or forget to wash my hands and I get berated. My wife has little patience for mistakes that involve germs. Often, I have to clean the house late at night after the kids go to bed so I will be doing it after midnight. Of course I will make mistakes when I am mentally exhausted.

&#x200B;

* If I bring her water, I have to wash my hands and then *hold      the cup over my head* as it clears the kitchen counter. She thinks that      if I hold her cup around my chest that it will touch the counter and be      dirty. I do the same thing with plates and utensils.
* If I have to discard a piece of clothing on the floor      in her vicinity, she will change her clothes and get pissed. She thinks      that the **air created when the clothing hits the floor will blow      bacteria all over her**. This is perhaps the one that triggers me the      most.
* If my dog gets out, he has to have a bath before he can      come back. He gets out often because she wont close the door.
* My wife **will not touch doorknobs**. She uses her      foot to close the door and she will just fucking leave it open over      actually closing it - even when she leaves the house.
* If I leave the house with my phone, I cannot bring it      back into the house until I sanitize it. That includes washing the phone      case with soap and water and then using alcohol on the phone.
* No shoes on the in house, ever. I had contractors over      a month ago and they wore shoes. I had to sanitize every object they      touched, and mop TWICE where they walked.
* Her depth perception is abysmal. We get in so many      fights because she thinks that I touched her with a dirty object when I      was *halfway across the room.* When she gets dressed, I half to watch      her and verify that she doesnt touch her body with the outside of the      shirt. Same with pants.
* We never have people over because of her fear of      infection. Plus, I am the one who has to clean and sanitize so I am      reluctant to even mention hosting an event or having a party at the house.

There is more things I have to deal with but I cannot remember every situation right now. The worst of it for me is the constant laundry (3-4 loads a day - sometimes more) and showers (4-5 showers a day). I have taken as many as **9** showers in one day and as many as **35** showers in one week. I wash my hands over 50 times a day. I have gotten to the point where I just pretend to take a shower or wash my hands if she isnt in the room. I fantasize about just being able to get through my day not feeling like a puppet on a string. I get no sleep (maybe 4-5 hours on average) and have almost no free time. And this is not because of my kids.

You may be thinking, ""dude, go to marriage counseling."" We did that about two months ago. My dad may be the only person who really knows what I am going through he told me to be completely honest - hold nothing back. That is exactly what I did. I told the counselor everything that I just revealed to all of you. I have had this talk with my wife already but she says, ""you can leave at anytime, if you cant handle it you dont have to be here."" The counselor was speechless for a second but then began to address my wife and asking her if it was all true. My wife just shutdown and barely refused to acknowledge it. After the session, my wife got upset at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" and canceled all future sessions.

I want to say one last thing. Before she went deep into this fear of infection, we had a great relationship. We loved each other and felt we were meant to be. I still love her and want it to work. I have been dealing with the worst of this for nearly 3 years now. I am physically and mentally exhausted. I have thought of leaving multiple times but I am afraid of how it will affect my kids. We also bought a huge house and invested sums of money into it that we would lose. My wife refuses to take medication for her anxiety (I dont blame her, most of it hasnt worked in the past).

Has anyone ever been in situation similar to this? Thank you for taking the time to read and I appreciate any and all advice.

**TL;DR** \- My wife suffers from extreme germophobia and it severely complicates my life and my childrens' lives.

EDIT:  I want to make something clear.  My children take 1 bath a day (sometimes two).  They dont do what I do - that is the one thing I absolutely fucking put my foot down on.  But yeah, they need out of this situation asap.  I talked to my wife a few minutes ago and let her know exactly how I feel - again.  She broke down, as expected, and ended our conversation.  When I get home we will continue to address this.  ",relationship_advice
I'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.,"[Update Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d68r0f/update_im_out_600_after_my29m_best_friend31m_and/)

&#x200B;

Groom and I had been friends since middle school and best friends since high school. I'm one of the only people he talks to about his emotions, which is particularly important because I've been his go-to for advice, especially in relationships. In fact, since knowing him, I've talked him through each of his break ups. We've mutually called each other brothers, he helped me move, I helped him plan and throw his mom's birthday party. I'm close with his family, his mom actively asks about me. I've also been close to each of his significant others, save for his now wife.

A month after his engagement, Groomsman Invitational Boxes went out. We have a very tight knit group of friends that have been together since high school, supplemented by college and work friends. Of the original high school group, I was the only one not asked to be a groomsman. This obviously stung, but I maintained a jovial demeanor towards everyone while acid flowed in my veins. It triggered my depression for a solid month where I questioned so much (do any of my friends even care about me? am i not groomsman material? is it because they thought i was too fat?) until the Groom and I had a talk.

He said it was a very hard decision choosing groomsmen, which I'm sure it was. He told me that I was in the original roster of groomsmen (only 6 out of 7 had received invitations) but that the Bride would not sign off on my involvement. Apparently, I had said something off-color about their relationship as it was beginning and she held it against me ever since. She'd apparently never brought it up until now, years later, and never gave me any indication of being uncomfortable with me (her family even loves me). I'm generally a very positive, well-received person, so this was news to me. He said it was tearing him up inside, and I believed him at the time, and he asked me to try and talk to her, see if we could make amends. He said that he'd let her know that I knew about how she felt towards me and that I'd be reaching out to talk about it. So I messaged the Bride through text and DM, saying (paraphrased), ""Hey! I'm so sorry if anything I've said has upset you. Can we meet sometime and talk? I'd love to clear it up, or hear your side at least."" The Bride leaves me on read, and a month later, the final Groomsmen Invitation Box goes out to another friend.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, the Bride, Groom, and I are hanging out. Groom and I are talking, and I'd since been able to process the reality of not being involved in my best friends wedding, so I ask how he's doing, and how all the prep is going. The conversation leads us here...

Groom: Hey man, I wanted to know if you could help me out with something?

Me: Sure. What's up?

Groom: I was wondering if you would want to usher for me? It's no big deal if you can't, but I want you to be there for me if you can, you know? Like, be a part of the wedding.""

Me (very touched): Yeah! Of course I can, dude. Anything for you two.

Groom: Thank you so much. You know, we also have the rehearsal dinner next week. I know it's late notice, but if you can make it...

Me: I'll have to see if I can leave work early, but I'm already there, man. Thanks for thinking of me!

A week goes by with no updates or details on ushering or the rehearsal dinner, so I shoot him a text saying, ""Hey man! Big day's this weekend. Just wanted to reach out and see if you still needed help with ushering, or if you'd still like me at the dinner. I got the time off with my boss, so I can definitely make it. Just let me know."" He returns my text a few hours later with a call saying (paraphrased), ""Yeah man, we would still like you to usher. I'll text you details later today, but we actually don't need any help at the rehearsal dinner, we kind of want it to just be the bridal party and stuff, but yeah. Thanks for helping us out!"" I'm a little put out, but I persevere. At least he asked me to be an usher. That's something, right?

Morning of the wedding comes around and I'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time I should show up to the reception to start helping. Then Bride messages me asking for a favor. These messages were juxtaposed perfectly against the unanswered messages I had previously sent the bride to olive-branch our relationship. Bride says they forgot about the appetizers & need someone to pick them up. Can I do this for a bride, on her wedding day? Sure. Oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. **Sure.**

At this point I should have stopped and asked myself, ""Why am I helping so much? Why didn't I ask for their money up front? Should being a good friend really cost you so much emotionally, physically, or monetarily?"" Hindsight. 20/20. With the ceremony ended, my group of friends who weren't in the wedding party spend the hour and a half before the reception pre-gaming while I go pick up the appetizers. Thank God I played as much Tetris as I have, because fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. I text the Bride to let her know we've got everything together and I'd see them at the reception. Once again, left on read.

I get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in. I find no leadership at the venue, no planners, no family who weren't already seated at their tables and otherwise willing to help the newlyweds get things ready. The venue does have staff, but they are all preoccupied with in-venue needs. So I have to carry all the appetizers inside by myself.

Since guests were already seating themselves, I immediately moved from placing the last appetizer box in the back to working usher duties at the front. It was a fucking mess. At one point, I was so down about the situation that I literally googled, ""is it an insult if someone asks you to usher their wedding?"" To start, the place cards were in no discernible order. They were also written in intricate cursive that was sometimes unclear. I should mention, too, that because of the cultural heritages of our newlyweds, we had some very interesting, hard to spell, and sure as shit hard-to-read-in-cursive names. We weren't given a table map, or a master list, or any direction at all. The best part is, I say ""we"" because at this point I met my ushering-peers; they were the Grooms youngest adult cousins, aged 18 and 19 (I'm 29), and they were really good at finding names and seating people. When I asked why they were so good, they said, ""they always make us do this because no one else wants to. We did this at the wedding last year.""

After finding out that, to the Groom, I was about as equal as the lowest-rung of his family, my group of not-in-the-wedding-party friends shows up. They ask me to stay for a drink, but I can't because I'm still ushering. As I step back behind the name card table, I take a look out the door to my left and see the groomsmen laughing and taking a selfie. To my right, I see all of my other friends at a table without me, taking a shot. I look down at the random, nonsensically ordered name cards and I wonder, how did I get here?

Wedding kicks off & in the rare instance I can speak to Bride & Groom they don't say thank you or bring up the money. I also don't talk money because it's their fucking wedding reception, but what should I do, pluck $500 from her wedding dress during the money dance?  I'm sure it's true of other weddings, but it seems like the bride and groom don't really engage or reply when I walk up to them with my hugs and congratulations. I can understand this. Maybe they're burned out. Maybe they're trying to hold back things from boiling to the surface.

Now the last song is playing, and the lights are on, and everyone's getting ready to go home and the Groom approaches me.

Groom: Hey, thanks again for your help. I was wondering if I could borrow you again?

Me: What's up?

Groom: Did you drive here? We have stuff we need to get back to the hotel... it could really help us out.

Me: ... how far is the hotel?

Groom: 10 minutes away.

Me (for a Groom, my best friend, on his wedding day: .... Sure.

Get to hotel, unpack everything, it's 12:30am, I'm hungry. Groom says to stick around, we'll hang out, drink more. He goes to get changed, I say I'm gonna grab food & come back. Groom asks for food for he & Bride. I say sure. Bride's cousin overhears & asks me to buy her food too. Sure. Then she asks the room at large who'd like food. Now I'm buying food for almost the whole after party. Cousin says she'll venmo me when I get back, & she'll pay for everyone elses stuff. **Sure.**

Come back, cousin is passed out. Drunken guests grab whatever food they see. Groom walks up to me, burger in hand, & says he's actually really tired so he's gonna go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. I grab my food, take the elevator to the first floor hotel cafeteria, & eat alone, upset, in silence. At this point, I'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late night food run, and am pretty sure that I never really had a best friend to begin with. I feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous. I went from, ""being a groomsmen,"" to being a guest, to being an usher, to being an unpaid wedding coordinator. This was the first wedding in my close knit friends circle and it turned out nothing like how I thought it would. I've never worked so hard for such little gratitude and I'm left wondering how I could have been such a chump, and how many other times I'd been taken advantage of for being helpful.

The advice I'm hoping for is, how can I go about expressing how terrible a time I had at his wedding without insulting him, if I should do that at all, how can I develop myself to not be put in situations like this, and when would it be appropriate to ask for the appetizer money back? Also, I feel like the missing puzzle piece is the Bride's side of the story, but she still hasn't given me any indication of what I did to her. I know she read my texts about wanting to clear the air, she had to have when she asked me to get the appetizers. How can I start a dialogue with her and sort this out if she won't even acknowledge it? Should I just step away from this relationship all together (after getting back my money)?

&#x200B;

tl;dr ""Best Friend"" couldn't make me groomsmen cause of now-wife, who had no problem asking huge favors of me on the day of the wedding, little to no thanks, out $$$, ended up doing the most out of whole friend group (groomsmen / bridesmaids included), ended the night feeling defeated and losing even more money.

Should I (48m) tell my wife (44f) that I received a sex tape of her in the mail?,"Throwaway.

This is an odd thing. Wife and I have been married 20 years. I've never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

First of the year, I receive a package in the mail. It's a DVD addressed to me, and a typed note that says ""your eyes only"". It's my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. She was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

First I've no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the DVD - none of which I know. I'm assuming it's one of my wife's ex. Second I've know idea why they sent it. Are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? The tape isn't time stamped so I don't have a frame of reference. She kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

And also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? I know my wife had other partners. Hell I had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago I think we're past that. But apparently this person or persons isn't.

The whole thing is strange. I'm not sure what's going on. I haven't told my wife, I'm not sure how she would take it. She's very sexual and adventurous but I don't think she'd like the idea of her past catching up to her. But I don't think I'll get to the bottom of this unless I tell her.

EDIT - update. I'm overwhelmed by the responses. Thank you for your interest.

I did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. Some mentioned letting her watch it in private and I gave her that option. She did and we talked at length. Some of it is a bit clearer now.

The two ""amateur"" looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. That's why the camera doesn't move and that's why the room is the same.  I asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

The other is a boyfriend she dated when her and I met, before we actually started dating. She knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it's him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

Why?

She admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on Facebook. When she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. She thinks he sent the DVD to cause an issue with us.

For the first time I now have doubts. Her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. And honestly I may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - I know it was 20 years ago but that's still hard to take call me shallow if you want. Also she didn't seem shaken by the DVD or the fact I had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. I had the idea she'd rather I didn't have it but now that I did, oh well. 

It still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the DVD was made in 2013 but I'm just getting it now? That many be minor but it may be everything. Plus how does this gentleman know where I live - Facebook doesn't give you that information. Being in contact with someone does so now you see why I have doubts.

Thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. I love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it's slapping us in the face right now. I will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

EDIT II - I want to clarify something. I've been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that I'm upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. None of my business, it was 20 years ago I should man up, that sort of thing.

Look, i said it was hard to take. Most men understand their partner was with different people before them. But SEEING their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. I didn't say I was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. It's just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. I'll get past it , but it's not an easy thing. And for everyone who says ""it was 20 years ago lighten up"" I challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. Frustrated at best. You won't love her less but you'll not feel great afterwards trust me. So thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position I'll ignore you thank you very much .

FINAL EDIT - this will be my final edit. Thank you all for your support but all I will say is, it's time for me to make some decisions. I hacked into my wife's Facebook account - childish and immature I'll admit but I did it nonetheless. And I found things disturbing enough that I need to think long and hard about what I do next. I've given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and I'm questioning her more than ever before. Heartbroken is putting it mildly. It's time for me to work on my life and my self. Thanks to everyone and their interest .",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] I (28M) think my girlfriend (26F) of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love.,"Link to previous post [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aejrnr/i_28m_think_my_girlfriend_26f_of_four_years_is/?st=JQRWKQ4D&sh=e1753ed8)

I finally talked to my girlfriend about it and unfortunately, she is now my ex-girlfriend. A lot of things that I never expected to happen did happen in a span of hours. 

As soon as she opened the door to our apartment, I could tell that she was already starting to cry. Seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because I didn't want to put her in that position. 

I had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. 

We sat down, there were lots of tears. I thought I would be bitter, angry and that I would be screaming at her the whole time but I felt disappointed instead. 

I told her that I saw the messages and explained how I ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. 

She kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn't know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.

Then I told her that WE go more way back than they ever did. I was there through her lowest point, I helped her get up.

She admitted that they had sex more than three times. 

I saw it coming, I had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. At that point, I was full on crying. I can't remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. It still is now. 

I remember telling her that I was done, that whatever we had was over. She kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, I don't think I ever will. I can't tolerate people who cheat.

By that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. 

Obviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. 

When I posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. His place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. He'll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that I can't bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.

We both agreed that I don't mention him in this post. I'm glad that I really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. Thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. 

It's almost 3am, I'm heartbroken as ever but I'm trying my best. I'm sending my resignation letter to work this morning. Every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. I'll be flying home as soon as possible. 

To all my Aussie mates,  if you live near/around Chapel Hill, let me know! 

America, you were great but now it's time to come home. Thanks for the help everyone.

EDIT: I'm crying again, not because I got cheated on but because I realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. I almost can't believe I looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. I am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.

Anthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. 

I may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but I gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. 

Other than that, I am feeling better. It still feels surreal that she's gone but what can a bloke do? She made her choice so I made mine. 

I woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that I shouldn't rush things and that she's stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. 

It sucks that I may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. I thanked them and said that although I believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. 

Ex also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so I junked it straight away. 

I miss her like crazy. I know it will take a lot of time to heal me but I guess I can wait. 

ps. I'll message my newfound Aussie friends when I go through all the comments. Exact date of my flight hasn't been sorted out yet, but I'm hoping i'll be home by next month.

My (19F) boyfriend (20M) broke up with me because I'm too good at sex,"We've been dating for a year and he's a year older than me and we met in college. We took things slow bc we're both virgins and it's special to both of us so we agreed we'd wait until we're really in love and sure about each other. And after a year, we could see ourselves married in the future so we decided to have sex. 

Even after our first time, he asked me if I really was a virgin or if I lied because I was too good. No I didn't lie. I just watched some educational videos and practiced on my own. Since then, he'd get weird during sex. Like if I did something good, he'd say it felt good and then his face would change like he was thinking. Now I know he was questioning if I really was a virgin. 

Anyway. He broke up with me yesterday after we had sex. TMI I was riding him and he said I act like a porn star and he's obviously not the only guy I've been with and he thinks I lied to him. I told him I watched a ton of porn and copy from the videos but he doesn't believe me. 

Great. Never thought I'd be dumped for being too good at sex. It just really sucks bc we had sex bc we thought we'd be long term and we broke up already. I want him back. I know he's just being paranoid. How do I tell him that I wasn't lying?

Okay quick update: he texted me and said sorry so we're back together :)",relationship_advice
"Overheard my [26M] fiancé [24F] tell her friend on the phone that she ""settled for being with me,"" and that marrying me was her ""last resort.""","

Update 2: Just did one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. Today after breakfast I told her we should ""sit down and talk."" She was hesitant, but I said it was important. We went to the living room and she said to me ""I already know what this is about."" My post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under ""popular."" Of course the water works started happening right away. I told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. Through her tears, she said ""I was just joking, I wasn't serious."" She then went on saying stuff like ""I love you, I love you."" I told her I can't be in a marriage where my S/O doesn't love me the same way I love them. She tried to tell me that she loved me and that I meant something to her. But it was all bullshit. She said she ""didn't want to lose me."" I told her I don't think this marriage was the right decision. And from there I basically told her it was over. I told her I knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. For all those wondering, we have no kids, and I pay fully for the apartment we live in, and I own almost everything we have other then her clothes. I even pay for her car. So after all of this she'll have little to nothing left. Before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, I've never been so happy with a decision I've made in my life. After that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me ""Fuck you."" She started screaming at me, telling me ""you just can't end things like that."" I told her I could do whatever I wanted, and that's when she became very hostile. She screamed at me saying, ""You're the fucking worst relationship I've ever been in. You think I can't find someone again?"" ""Do you think you'll ever from someone as good as me? You're a fucking idiot [my name]."" She grabbed her bag and phone, and said ""I'm leaving!"" Before slamming the door behind her. At that moment I felt like I was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you'd find of TV. I sat down on the couch and cried, and I'm still crying as I type this up. It's both happy and sad tears, and I knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. She never loved me, it was obvious. Our relationship only went one way, and I feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier I live in California, and I'm gonna start the process to annul our marriage. Tomorrow, I'm gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that's essentially where they belong. (I'm not throwing out her stuff. Just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. All of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and I know my life will certainly improve as a result.

Edit/Update: Thanks everyone for the kind words! Really has made me feel a lot better! Going to be talking to her soon. Also, I noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, I understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn't. I've been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. Not really used to calling her my ""wife"" yet. Also I used an old alt since she uses Reddit. Anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the Internet can care so much about a person they don't even know. I'm going to talk to her today. I will be updating you all soon after.

Edit: Meant to put wife in the title but now I can't change it.

Basically the title. I overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while I was passing the bedroom. This friend is in a serious relationship. My wife then said to her, ""Sweetie, remember it's your choice. Don't settle for just anyone. That's the mistake I made. Who knows who else I could of had. [My name] was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up."" Hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. Does she even love me? Why am I being treated as a second base? 

Am I being dramatic and overreacting? I haven't said anything about it since. I honestly don't know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.,"Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

I'll post the update first, since there has been some change since I last posted. Then I'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of PMs I received.

Yesterday, I received a call from my GF. She was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. I told her that I still care for her, and that I'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

She told me that a few days after I told her we were done, she called up her Mother to talk about this. Apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her Mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that I was actually manipulating her to do so. Her Mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

After I left her, my gf called her Mum up to talk about what went on. My GF said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her Mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. My GF said she broke down on the phone, and her Mother kept asking her what she will do. The conversation then ended when my GF said she didn't know.

Then she started texting. After a few hours of thinking, my GF sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. She was then blocked.

My GF then called me, and told me everything.

She will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

I discussed this with my GF, and we both completely agreed that I had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that I put my foot down, because had I not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (Her words, not mine)

She further went on to say that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a Mum, if she had me, she could get through this. I broke down at this point.

I love her so much. In truth, I probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though I knew I'd resent it. I made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if I had made the right decision.

I'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

Also, screw any Mother who places religion over their own child. Friggin lunatics.


Now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: No. My GF did not cheat on me. I am almost certain about this. Not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. Moreover, her roommate took photos of my GF after she came home assaulted. It's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: I don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. Come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my GFs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. Talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: My GF was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the Mum).

4: Thanks for all the people telling me I did the right thing. It was really difficult. I'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: To the people who PM'd me telling me I'm a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

UPDATE TO: I found out I have a daughter who thinks I was her mother's rapist. It wasn't rape. What next?,"Ten days ago I requested advice and the post got removed after a day because I didn't use a ThrowRA.  I'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. I alerted the moderators I would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

ORIGINAL

I received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a DNA match and she is my biological daughter. It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.

I was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.

I did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

One of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

It kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

I have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up. Advice, please!

UPDATE

I hired a lawyer. He recommended that I respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. I wrote her a short message and described how and when Terry and I met. I was careful not to attack Terry and to offer sympathy. I explained that our sex was consensual. A week went by with no response.

Two days ago my daughter wrote me and said Terry now claims she was raped a month after she and I had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. She's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. I find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not I guess it gives Terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

Yesterday I spoke to my daughter for the first time. She was crying and so was I, so it wasn't easy to say much. Before we hung up, I told her that I loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and I hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. She sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

My wife and I told our kids about a week ago. They are teenagers and took it really well. All three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. My wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. She has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the Christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. My daughter is going to call me again tonight and I'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. We have a lifetime of catching up to do.

Meantime as for Terry, I feel like my daughter and I were robbed, but I really don't want to dwell on it. She hasn't reached out to me and I don't plan to either, though I'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.


EDIT:  I'm overwhelmed by all the love coming at me from Reddit. Thank you all for your support, compliments and helpful opinions. Really, really.
I promise I will post an update!

My(39m) wife(40f) slapped our daughter (16f) after she came out as gay. I need help dealing with my wife and my daughter.,"I'm actually an immigrant from Mexico, so my English is average at best. 

I must admit that I was really homophobic and racist growing up. That was how I was raised. But when I moved to America, I met my wife and she helped me a lot. She helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. I owe that to my wife.

Yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. So we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. It took some time to sink in, but I understood. When I asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. She asked me if I was fine with it and I told her that I had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. I must admit that I felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

After that, I asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. She told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. I'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. So I started to get ready to prepare it. 

At this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. Idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. And when I came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. My daughter was crying and I was really shocked. I asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. She told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

I asked my wife to leave, because I was really angry. After my wife left I told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and I'll stand by her. My daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

Now, my wife refuses to talk to me. She told me that she will be back only if I agree to help my daughter become straight. Idk what to make out of this. I'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. I love both of them very much and I'd like to help diffuse this situation.

Update: My (21M) girlfriend (21F) went on an anti Semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. I'm Jewish...,"OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc0gp4/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti_semitic/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app


I figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. This all happened a few days ago. 

The day I made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. Well, that didn't turn out well. 

Before I told her about my background, I asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards Jews. She pretty much sounded like Hans Landa the whole time. At one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for ""teaming up"" with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible ""prank"" on a Jewish student. 

Afterwards I bluntly told her that I'm Jewish. She didn't believe me at all and thought I was joking. I told her that I was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. This went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

When it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. Things went 0-100 very fast. She got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. She said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. When she insulted me I reminded her that she really liked me despite my ""dirtiness"" which just pushed her over the edge. She cried hysterically and I left. 

The next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that SHE dumped me and not the other way around.  She warned me not tell people that I dumped her since that would make her look bad. I didn't say anything and closed the door. I heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare I close the door in her face and that ""you people are all the same"". After a while she left and started writing me on Snapchat. I blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. I've never seen her act so crazy. 

Long story short, I blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. I knew things wouldn't go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but I didn't know it would be this bad. Some of her stuff is still at my place. Oh well

"My (18F) best friend (18F) cheated on her boyfriend (21M), got pregnant and is lying that he's the dad. Should I tell him?","Ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. Also I know this is pretty fucked up but Natalie is a nice girl, she's my best friend. 

We graduated high school this summer so our friends and I all went on a small vacation to Italy. We found a Groupon thing online so it wasn't too expensive. Natalie is dating Eric but he didn't come on the trip with us. It was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. It's pretty well known among us friends that Dylan who is in our high school, likes Natalie. He's like really into her. Well when we all went to Europe, since Eric wasn't there, Natalie was all over Dylan. Acting like a couple, being all flirty. They'd SLEEP in the same bed but she'd insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. Well, I shared a room with Natalie and I walked in on them having sex. Afterwards I asked her what she was doing since she was dating Eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. It was not. We were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. Dylan's dreams came true that week. But only I knew about it since it was our room. Everyone else had their suspicions but I was the only one who really knew the truth. 

When we got back home, she promised me that she was just ""crazy"" since she was on vacation and she'd never cheat on Eric again. She kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. So I promised to keep her little fling a secret. Fucked up I know but I have more loyalty to Natalie than Eric. 

She continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she's now pregnant and I asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if I slapped her across the face. She said it's obviously Eric and I reminded her about Dylan and she insisted that Eric is the father and to never mention Dylan in front of her again. She's terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told Eric and he told her not to worry and he'll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they'll be ok. She told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he's gonna be a good dad. He wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she's busy planning a quick wedding too. 

Y'all. Dylan is obviously the father. Like 100%. They were fucking like rabbits in Italy and I don't think she knew how to say ""where can I buy condoms"" in Italian. I feel bad for Eric since he's like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

I love Natalie she's my best friend but this is so fucked up like I feel really bad for Eric. I know she's scared and Eric would obviously be the better dad but c'mon that's not his baby. Dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. Eric is older and he's graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. But it's not fair for him. I know she's trying to save her own ass but it's her fault for cheating on him.

I don't know like if I tell Eric, Natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby's life.",relationship_advice
My [33M] fiancée [27F] chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. How can I ever repay her?,"Two nights ago, my fiancée accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. The fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. I wasn't home, so I wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. If I was, I would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. It's just stuff. 

She chose differently. First, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. Then she went back in. At this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. She knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

Both of us have lost parents. I lost my dad 3 years ago. He was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before I actually met her. I have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom I have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. She lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

Instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

I don't even know how to begin to say thank you. I'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and I can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. I don't know how to repay her. Or where to begin. Can anybody think of a nice gesture I can make it up to her? She must be devastated. I can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad.

Short update because I'm supposed to be working. And I don't expect this to get attention because my original post didn't but I don't know who else to tell. 

The day after I posted originally, I told her I'm in love with her, and asked her on a ""real date"". It went well. Really well, so easily and just good. And she slept next to me again that night.. I got to kiss her in public! She said it felt like our little family was right, and it really does, it feels like everything just sort of snapped into focus.

I'm distraught.  I don't even have anyone else in my life rn.  My two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into Uni and i have only really ""clicked"" with one guy friend.

She's REALLY sorry.  I saw her crying when she didn't know I could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  I feel bad but like the lying and deception isn't new.  I had to do it.  I told her we're over, but she's welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

But FUCK this sucks.  I have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and I just don't know how to cope with this.  I can't eat.  I can't sleep and I have class in the morning.  I keep picturing the texts and visualizing him ""pounding"" her and I'm just disgusted.  I'm just obsessing over it and it's 4 am in the fucking morning.

"UPDATE: I (21M) got my FWB (33F) pregnant and she's keeping it, I want to talk to her about other options.","This is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bhfi57/_/

Well some time has passed.. And a lot has happened. My first post had a lot of comments and I got some PM's from people asking me what went down so that's why I'm updating.

So I didn't end up talking about abortion or anything like that because I realized it was pointless and rather insensitive. I didn't talk to her for 3 days, which she got a little upset about and I shouldn't have done that. But I needed some time to figure things out and think, because whatever I was going to decide would change my life so I needed some space, though I could have communicated a bit more (which I'm working on now).

Anyways, I realized that I'm just straight up ridiculously in love with her and have been for a while. I was stuck on the age gap, I kinda blocked the word relationship in my mind when I thought of her. Some comments really stuck with me and I decided to just trust my feelings. I ended up confessing my love for her when we finally met up and well lots of (happy) tears were shed. She was too scared to talk about her feelings because she knew how I felt about the age gap and she didn't want to make me uncomfortable or possibly mess up what we had. I'm very glad to say that she feels the same way. She completely lit up when I told her, I saw the joy and happiness in her eyes. She was ecstatic, I won't ever forget that. 

Every minute we've spent with each other since has been amazing. I really do love this woman, there's just no way around it. We talked so much with each other the past couple of weeks and I don't understand how it has all been so amazing. I know we're probably still sort of in a honeymoon phase right now, but damn if she isn't the one.. I moved in with her almost 2 weeks ago, I had to do some adjusting at first but we worked through it. She has met my parents, that went surprisingly well actually. They got along really well, and they both told me that they could see why we were together and that we are a great fit. On top of that they both told me in private how much they like her, that has never happened with any girl I've introduced them to. The pregnancy came as a big shock however, and they needed some time to process it because well, they're going to be grandparents. I'm an only child so it's a pretty big deal, I'm really close with my parents. They are handling it right now, they asked a lot of questions and we answered them together. They fully support us now which does mean a lot to me.

She's in the last week of the first trimester now, and she's doing really well so far. I've been trying to help her and support her any way I can, and did a TON of reading online to understand what's going on. I offered to pause school for one year, but she insists we can make it work and that I can keep going. We need to work out the details but we got some time left for that.

So yeah... I'm going to a dad. She's gonna give birth to our kid.. Still feels surreal to me, but I'm low-key kinda excited. It'll probably be very exhausting and hard at first but that's life. I'm happy that I'm doing this together with her. 

(any tips on how to support her during her pregnancy are welcome btw..)

"Wife (38F) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and ""our twins""","This is all over the place. I really need help.

My wife and I (M42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

All this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. After some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

We were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. Ofcourse I was super happy . 

A week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. The test came back negative and ofcourse I was devastated but she wasn't. She claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. We took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. My wife is in complete denial. Now she claims we are having twins. She is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

I am at a loss and don't know what to do. My inaction is making her believe that I want to leave them and that I am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

What the f is even happening. I love her but I don't know what to do.

My gf was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby,"Really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my GF was raped. It was done in a park. She didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. I couldn't force her, so I just stayed with her.

She was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and I've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. We went to therapy, and she knows I'm there for her. She has a history of depression, and I've been really worried.

Last week, we found out she was pregnant. I was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. So the baby definitely isn't mine. She is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

So we had a discussion. She is a devout Catholic. We initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her Mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

I flat out told her that I would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. She cried and begged me not to leave. I told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and I leave, or she aborts the baby and I stay. I would not let this go.

She didn't want either of those things to happen, so I told her we were done...

I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I don't know what to say to her.,"Hey everyone. I don't know what to do in this situation because I never expected I'd face something like this. I'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but I'm coming up seriously short here.

I met my wife on Tinder at the end of 2015. We talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. By the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. We were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. More than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

I know, heavy topics for a first date. We were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

At the very least I held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. Her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. She immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

We dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. After getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

Four nights ago was the first time I ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. My wife was out with a friend, and I was doing some house cleaning. I was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so I took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. At the bottom I saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case B were visible. I immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

I had known that my wife was on her period because when I tried to initiate sex, she told me so. I found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and I made comment about the timing being odd. She told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. I figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

I haven't told her that I found the box. When she got home that night everything was so normal. I tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

The more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. What if she was assaulted? What if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? What if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? Or, what if she just cheated? I only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of Plan B and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

I don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. We have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. I've done nothing to displease her, at least that I know of. Maybe I'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than I'm giving it credit for. But I feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because I don't know how.

My plans have changed a bit, I am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend I was supposed to go to. I called him up and let him know I want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but I know i will be leaving for somewhere. He said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. We will see how that turns out...

Later in the day I responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since I sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
I picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. I could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. She kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. She I have misunderstood the entire situation... I could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). Anyway I told her to explain it to me right then and there. She said because I only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that I should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. During the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
After she told me its all a misunderstanding I told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
After I hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). It didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. She said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. I was just quiet during most of it. The more I didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

She started telling me I can fuck other women if I want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
I told her fucking other woman was not something I needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
The sister was telling her stuff in the background but I couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

She kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. After that she started saying something but I just hung up. 

For like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. He told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that I always will be welcome to him and that I am a good guy. His wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. She tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. I politely tell her I appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

My ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. She then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
She kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and I didnt say much.

After some time I just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. She starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that I said I would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. I told the sister I only said I think about it, and now that I have I realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. She then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
The only thing I said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". After this I just hung up.

My phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. I dont plan on responding. I honestly feel ALOT better right now, like I can move on. I will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. If someting more happens I will update this post.

Maybe I will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
Once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

I dont know when I feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. Once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, I am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

Thanks!

EDIT 1: Thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold I appreciate the support ALOT. I however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

I would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. I am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). Hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

Also I dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). Aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity I dont mind answering them.

I also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). In a month? when i am back from vacation?

Once again thanks for all the support

EDIT 2: My friend went over to get the ring from her but she refused to give it to him and told me she would not give it to anyone and that I have to pick it up by myself. I dont know why she is still acting like this. I am thinking of just letting the ring go and be able to have a clear mind.",relationship_advice
[Update] From the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on Christmas,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  My girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think I'm a loser. Even though we're an otherwise great couple, I'm thinking about breaking up because I don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and I can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

I posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. It got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and I was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. Gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and I fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the Big Talk.

Little did I know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. I didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. So Thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, I got a dreaded ""WE NEED TO TALK"" text. Yep, all caps. And I was like ""welp, I'm dead.""

She was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). Still, she said I had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and I agreed/apologized. She knows I'm writing this update and she's going to read it before I post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

We talked for a long time Thursday night. She said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. It's partially a cultural thing, according to her. Gf was born and raised in the U.S. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. She said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class Americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. Gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. She grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

On top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. She said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. Gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. She also got very little affection from her parents growing up. It seems like that was all replaced with material things. So, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

All that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. She was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. She was really hurt that I said I thought I was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and I said I was sorry, and I am. I was still raging a little when I wrote that. I asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. It wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

We've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. I'm totally fine this. We've been together for almost 3 years and I think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. She's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. We spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. It's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. I'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. No one can change their habits overnight.

We're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. The plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. She also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. It's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. We're going to give it until my lease is up in March (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. She isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before March.

tl:dr: Thanks, Reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. I did and I think things are going to get better.

EDIT

To everyone who's wondering, her parents are from Mexico.

Gf has a job and her own income. She is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

Also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on Reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. You're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. In that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. That's now just out there for the whole world to read. You can't say that wouldn't be alarming. She said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. All things considered, I think she was pretty reasonable about it. Ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure I thanked Reddit for the perspective. No, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. She's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",relationship_advice
I [26M] upset a woman [20sF] and my friends are acting like I'm in the wrong.,"Hey guys.

I went out clubbing last night with my friends. There were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. My girlfriend Hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. I offered to stay in with her but she insisted I go out and have a good time. 

At the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. They were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

One of them, Lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. She was pretty but I was not interested as I have a girlfriend. I told her this but she then started asking for pics of Hannah. I showed her and she said that I ''could do better than that''. I was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

Later me and my friends were dancing, and Lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. I gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. A while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. She smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. I was absolutely fuming and in response I poured my beer on her head. She started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

Everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. I understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like I was wrong to pour my drink on her. They all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

The ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when I pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

Nobody said goodbye to me last night and I made my own way home. I told Hannah what happened and she agrees that I didn't do anything wrong. I tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

How do I sort this out in a mature way?

TL;DR: My friends are acting like I was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.",relationship_advice
Update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met,"This is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

As a quick summary: I thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend ""Maggie"" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker ""Joe"" and his wife ""Kate."" After just a couple weeks, she was trusting Joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to Maggie's family Thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. I thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or Maggie had attachment issues.

I figured out what was going on and I feel like a huge idiot. I went to see Maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if I didn't like what I heard I'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue I couldn't handle.

I had the opportunity when I saw the gifts Maggie had gotten for Joe and Kate's kids. It seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

I asked Maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. Maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to Joe and Kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. Maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for Christmas.

I wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then Maggie said that she used to exchange Christmas gifts with Joe and Kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

I realized I was missing something important. If Maggie had other Christmases with Joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like I thought. I had thought that Maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but I didn't think Maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. I didn't want to ask, so I acted normally until I left.

When I got home, I went through Maggie's Facebook. She wasn't lying and she's not crazy. I found a ton of photos with Joe and Kate going back a decade. From what I can figure out, they all went to college together, Joe and Maggie were Big Brother and Little Sister in a coed frat/sorority, and Maggie and Kate were roommates. I also found pictures of Maggie as a bridesmaid in Joe and Kate wedding and pictures of Maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. All of Maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that I know all this.

I think this whole thing is my fault. I have ADHD and I don't handle it well. I've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where I start zoning them out. I've been called out for this before. I think it's pretty likely that Maggie did tell me about Joe and Kate and I just wasn't listening. Maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so I think it's more likely that I wasn't listening when Maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

This was a pretty big wakeup call for me. I've been ignoring my problem because I didn't want to face facts that it was serious but I know I need to do something before I make anymore mistakes. I'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.",relationship_advice
Girlfriend's little brother used my collection of '64 Kennedy Half Dollars to buy drugs,"My girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. He lives with us (we are both late 20's and have FT jobs).

I have been stacking 1964 Kennedy half dollars for ten years now. For those that don't know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

I had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

I insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like I mentioned. Whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that's what her brother thought he was stealing. And according to her ""he only got $100 of weed so that's fair"". Okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? What then?

She also called my silver stack ""useless and paranoid and stupid"". I collect them partially for a store of value Incase of inflation or deflation, but I also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

I guess I'm looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they're worth for the value of silver. It also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. Which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I [24F] am dating a [25M] almost unreasonably picky eater and I'm pretty much at the end of my rope,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3ev1n/i_24f_am_dating_a_25m_an_almost_unreasonably/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

This happened last night.

&#x200B;

This update is way more dramatic and unpleasant than I had hoped but it is what it is. I read what you all wrote and I appreciate all the comments left for me. Despite a few outlandish ones, they were all very helpful and reaffirming of my beliefs that I'm not being nit picky about this issue. 

I decided to give it one last shot at broaching this issue with him and letting him know how serious it was to me. He needed help and so long as I saw that he was trying that was all I asked for. We were out to dinner (I'm sure you can all guess what we had to eat) when he brought up his trip to Germany and how he would have to find a supermarket stat in order to stock up on frozen pizzas to keep his ""streak going."" I was hoping to do it after the trip so as not to ruin his good time but I figured now was as good a time as any: 

Me: Maybe you don't have to continue to the streak. Maybe you can just try new German cuisine without worrying about having to get pizza into your diet the entire time. Have you talked with your therapist about your avoidant eating?

J: No way. I have people depending on me to continue this streak. I don't want to let them down.

Me: I don't think anybody really cares about this streak as much as you do and frankly, I'm worried about you. This is really unhealthy and it's consuming your life. You're about to go on this incredible trip to Germany and the forefront of your mind is to get to a grocery store to pick up frozen pizzas. I think you really need to discuss this with your therapist again.

We had a back and forth the rest of our meal about his diet and how it was affecting our relationship. He doesn't think it's a problem because his health is fine (keep in mind he's only 25) and how I was being a busy body and needed to mind my own business. I let him know how this IS my business because it affects me. We can only go out to eat one thing, we can never have a meal at home together, and if we did decide to move forth and have children the example he is setting is awful. 

We let the issue go for the rest of dinner not wanting to escalate it, and ate in silence. The plan after was to go back to his place where I would spend the night. The entire trip home he was silent but very obviously simmering while I wished I had just gone home. I should have gone home. I guess I didn't expect the shitstorm that waited when I got to his place.

He flipped.

He began screaming how he was so sick of me bringing this up and how it was his life and how I couldn't control what he did or ate. I told him I cared about him and his health and wanted him to recognize what he was doing was not healthy. I ultimately agreed that he was right, I couldn't control what he did or what he ate, but he can't expect that I stick around and watch and enable him like I had been doing in the past. 

It escalated from there how he had been there for me the entire time when I was an active alcoholic and through my relapses. I could not and still cannot dispute that. He was. I guess the only difference between him and I is that I wanted to change. I acknowledged the issue and knew I could not go on like this any longer. Obviously though, it is much quicker to see the downfall of someone suffering from alcoholism vs someone who is suffering from this kind of eating disorder. One spirals much faster than the other so I was able to recognize it much quicker. 

I told him I was going to leave because I couldn't deal with this anymore. We kept fighting and fighting and he let me know he would ""expose"" me. He has a blog and he told me how he would write one about what it was to live with an alcoholic and use my name. He would be sharing it on facebook. I completely panicked. I cried and begged that he didn't use my most vulnerable moments against me. He told me if I walked out he absolutely would. 

That was all I needed to hear. He was going to blackmail me. I think this snapped me awake to realize this isn't love. If I leave he's going to humiliate me on the internet to get back at me, that absolutely isn't love.

So I left. I don't have many possessions there but he can keep them for all I care. He emailed me a draft of the post (blocked him on everything else) and the subject was ""last chance.""

Let him post it. Fuck it. I can't control other people I can only control myself and how I react. I deactivated all my social media and I'm ready to move on with my life. It hurts that somebody I trusted so much would explicitly broadcast my past, but it's a learning lesson. Thank you all for reading.

My(23F) boyfriend(25F) left me on the side of the road and I deserved it.,"My amazing, beautiful boyfriend had decided to treat me to dinner since we'd both had long weeks. He was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. After we were done we left, and we were about half way home when I asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. He said something like ""Haha, didn't we just eat?"" and keeps driving. My stupid, selfish self pushes it and says ""C'mon, please? I want something sweet."", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. After that I kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than I deserve, he's firm and says no. I give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. Apparently I pulled harder than I thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. To make things worse, he just bought this car. The driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). They didn't even exchange any information. While he's being yelled at, I don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something I did. When he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. His entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. To try and break the tension a little, I say ""Well, that could've gone a lot worse."" As soon as I say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. I've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment I did. He looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. I got out and he sped off. It was starting to get dark and I was in a stretch of woods. It took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when I got there him and all his stuff was gone.

I feel so horrible. I cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. We've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now I don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. I've been getting texts like ""Wtf"" and ""What the hell is wrong with you"" from our friends so I think he's told them what happened. 

It seems like everybody's mad at me. Is there any way to fix this? How can I apologize to them when all our friends are siding with him?",relationship_advice
I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had,"It was quite by accident that I heard this.  We had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  Some of us were in one room playing Texas Holdem and a couple of others were watching a Lord of the Ring marathon.  I thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  Our group had run out of soda so I got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  As I'm rounding the corner I hear my fiance talking and before I completely come in the room I hear her clearly say ""Jason is great but he will never be the lover that Bill was"" she then followed it up with ""Its not really fair to Jason though, Bill was just really gifted down there"".

At first I thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but I decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  Her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and I could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know I was there.  Of course she has no idea I heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how I'm doing and if I'm having fun.  I was tempted to say something like ""I'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but I didn't.  I just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  I just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

Needless to say it fucked me up.  I mean fucked me up bad.  I've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  I couldn't sleep that night and I went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  At first I was angry.  Then I was humiliated.  Then I was depressed.  Then I was angry again.

Look I realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  I would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

I tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on I just kept getting worse and worse.  I was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  That is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and I flat out rejected her.  It wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  I had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  But in the moment instead of being sexually aroused I felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  Nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

She asked me what was wrong and I just told her I must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

So much to my humiliation there I laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  I came clean and told her what I heard.

Well this did not go over well at all.  At first she tried to tell me I did not hear her correctly.  But I just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  Well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  Which once again I am sure was more of a big turn off for her because I was a wreck emotionally.

She tried to tell me how much of a better person I was and how I satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  But all I could hear was Charlie Browns teacher noise.

It's been almost a month and I have zero desire to be with her sexually.  None.  She is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what I have tried I just can not get past this.  It's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  She clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  Well I know I can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  But no matter what I do I can't grow in size.  Obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me I won't believe her.  She's most likely right.

Some back story here.  He dumped her.  It was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  I know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  She said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  So this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"".  If he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  Now I have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but I don't think she would.

I just don't know what to do here.  I can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  I know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  Her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that I think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told I am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  Like what would happen if I lost my good paying job or better yet what if I were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  Basically what I feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  I know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what I feel.

I'm sorry for the length here and I don't even know what I am asking here.  I am totally lost and if this continues I just think I am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and I need advice.

EDIT:  Holy God.  I made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went Christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  I have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  I don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  I am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  Also thank you for the Gold and Silver kind internet strangers.

EDIT 2:  Dear God.  I read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking I had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5K more posts.  I'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   I was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  I haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have I opened any of the 20 chat screens.  There are issues I want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  She was to use the Barney Gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"".  In other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  Nope, neither of us drink.  We don't even have it in the house.
2. That I am upset she told her friend.  Well this is an odd thing, before I posted this honestly I wasn't that upset about this part.  I was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  However now reading a lot of the post I have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  I would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. That I am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  Well I'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  But the last part is just out of my control.  No matter what I do I will only ever be 7"" long.  We have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  She said that I was already great with everything but the one thing I can't control. (Okay, so I gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. No I'm not going to do anything rash.  It's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  But yes I have to decide what I am going to do here before long.  It's not fair to either of us is I am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. She is sorry that I heard it.  She said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if I didn't catch her saying it.  It is what it is.  But yes I do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since I first told her.  Me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  I don't know how much of that I believe but right now I guess I don't know why she would lie.  It really has wrecked hell on our Christmas spirit this year I know that. 

EDIT 3:  Engineer for those who keep asking what I do for a living.  She is a paralegal.  
EDIT 4:  People have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how I know she was heartbroken.  We met about 9 months after they separated.  I know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  He just ended things so he could be with another woman.  She approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  On our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  It was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but I did it.  We sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time I never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates I tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because I didn't want to commit either.  After close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  Obviously that was our first night together.  Within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  So yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  I had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

EDIT 5:  Okay I posted it below in the mass of other posts but I have also started a new post and hopefully the mods let it stay open.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/?

My wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary,"Tl;Dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. Brought flowers to wifes office. Found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

Yup. Tl;Dr  says it all. My (35m) wife (35f) and I were married ten years ago yesterday. She has been working on a big project for the last few months. The last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. This is a career maker for her.

 I work construction. With the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. So I work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. If its raining when I get up I dont go in. Somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. I usually hit the gym for an hour or two. Thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. We go home. I go to the gym as usual. I cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife Mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. We really havent seen much of each other this week. I went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. Not unusual for past month. 

I stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. Nichole was at the receptionist desk. I told her I got here later than I wanted could she put the flowers on Mehgans desk. She said ""I dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" She buzzed the door to get back to the offices. The place was deserted. I went to her office, the door was closed . I always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. I walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. She is giggling only as she can. Saying""we got to get this done"".  I am gut punched. I slammed the flowers down said ""Happy Anniversary"" and walked out. I didnt hear what she said just went past Nichole said goodbye and left. Made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

I balled my eyes out all the way home. Went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. I drove about 2 hours to a State Park. I had no idea what to do . I just had to run. I hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. I dont drink much so I had no booze, I just sat there thinking. Looking back I am glad I was in a rush, normally I bring a 45cal. With me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. The way I was feeling I might have ate the barrel that night. My phone was blowing up fom Mehgan so I had turned it off. I left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. I called him back. He said Meghan called him to check on me, make sure I didnt do anything stupid. We talked a bit, told him I got to think this thru, would catch up on Friday.

So while I am thinking about this, I go over our marriage from the beginning to see what I missed. We come from completely opposite backgrounds. My Grandfather raised me with my mom. He taught me about life. He had a little saying about everyhing. He told me marriage would be the hardest job ZI ever had, you had to work on it everyday. God I miss him. We did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. They worked hard and my brother and I did not miss out on anything we knew of.

Mehgan was born into money. Not overly rich but very comfortable. Went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. And she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. I would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  We met hit off started dating. I was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. We dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. Our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. Families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. Her dad and I started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

She graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. We work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. I took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. We agreed we had to experience the others interests. She was really enthused about the more physical things we did. I kinda like the symphony and such. I own two tuxes now.

I look back and do not see any red flags. Her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. She was paraded out in front for photo ops. Invited to conferences when other newbies were not. At dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. She quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . This 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. She seems very happy. We seemed very happy. 

So now, Friday, I am home. I called her. Asked where she was, back at work. I being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. She responded since I would not talk what was she to do? Fair enough. She will be home in an hour. So I wait. I want to save our marriage. If I am lacking in providing then I want to fix it. I want to ask why of course but I can not accept  a IDK answer. How do I phrase this? What else should I be asking? I know I will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  What she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. Thank you in advance.",relationship_advice
Engagement ring/breakup fund,"[update] Thank you all!! I appreciate the traction this silly post gained. Your responses have more that assured me that I've got something here. I got back from my parent's 25th anniversary party my sisters and I put on today and the post blew up. I hope to some day be half as close with someone as my parents! 

I did my best to get through all the comments and reply/upvote where appropriate. Have an amazing day everyone!

Whenever I start a new relationship I start putting away 50 dollars a month in a savings account. I'm a big romantic so I intend on using this money, in the event this girl is ""the one"", towards an engagement ring far down the road. Subsequently, if the relationship turns goes bad and ends in a breakup, I cash out the savings and splurge on myself as part of my healing and moving on phase. Is this idea brilliant or am I putting too much attention on these extremes?",relationship_advice
UPDATE I've been putting off introducing my [28M] girlfriend [26F] to my parents [60sM/F] because they'll be weird about her weight,"[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh673p/my_28m_parents_60s_mf_are_about_to_meet_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Thank you to the many commenters who offered good advice. Including to call in advance and  let my parents know how it was going to go down if they wanted a role in this new part of my life. 

Went like this. Paraphrasing of course. 


Me: Hey Mom and Dad, You know I mentioned a girlfriend a few times. We're moving in together so I'm thinking I'll bring her out. 


Mom: Oh that's nice. First week of December maybe? 


Me: Sure. Look there's one thing though. She's not thin. If you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we're done, we're going home. I love her. And she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so I expect you to show her the same respect. 


Mom: But you have so many prospects and a good job why would you—


Me: No. This is exactly what I'm talking about. 


Mom: Fine. I'm just happy I finally get to meet her. 


Dad: *Insulting weight related comment*


Me: What the fuck dad? 


Mom: Oh babe give it a rest, it can't be that bad. 


Me: No if there's any chance of that sort of commentary, I'll just not come. I have zero tolerance for this. You're going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won't get the chance to screw it up. 


Dad: *Insulting joke* 



Me: Ok, bye. If you wonder why [brother] is buying a tux for a wedding you've heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. 



Mom: No, wait, I'll make sure his act is together by the time you're out here. 


Dad: *Insulting comment* 



Me: I'm hanging up. 


So it looks like I'm going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. Probably not soon. My girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and I started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said ""It would be nice if I could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won't be possible and it definitely isn't worth putting you through this.""

So thanks for the comments and help. For now it's a non issue it turns out.

I [M 32] ruined Christmas and I have no regrets.,"Is anyone else's family this dysfunctional? Every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years I was the one who blew up for the first time. 

Long story short, i'm half-Korean/half-white. My mom is Korean. My dad side is white. So we only have my Dad's side here in the US. For years, I watched my some of my dad's side speak down to my mom. They never invite her to things. Me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. To be frank, I don't care how i'm treated. Every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it's only 2-3 times a year. We repeat the process and don't expect much from these family members. My mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. My white Grandma is 80 and she's the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

Three times today I watched a family member (Aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn't speak english and shut her down over simple questions like ""where should I sit?"". I watched my mom quietly recoil and I couldn't stand to see it again. This aunt does it the most and I finally blew up. I yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. I told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. To stop speaking to my mom (who's lived in the US for 35 years) like she doesn't speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. I watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.  

My Aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. As she was leaving I walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom's yearly gift to her. I said  ""for 30 years I watched my mom give you a gift every year. I watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. I've never seen you treat her with the same"".  She didn't say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom. 

Before I left, I apologized to everyone and explained why I was upset. Everyone was shocked how mad I got. I felt like everyone understood why I was mad.  Prior to this (around thanksgiving) I spoke to some family members about how I was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. Which they have been trying to do more. 

After blowing up, it made things awkward. People trickled out early too. Now my grandma is talking about not doing Christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. I feel bad, but i've never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. Does anyone have any advice on this? Handling rude family?  Should I do something else? 


[Edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below]

Mom's reaction: On the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. She's always taken the high road it's a very Korean Christian mom approach. My mom's method of being a pacifist is very much an older Immigrant/Korean/boomer approach too. It's taught me a valuable skill in life. I don't regret picking my battles and that's why i'm so appreciative of being Korean/white. After we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. She didn't say anything and asked me if I wanted my favorite Korean dish. 

Where is my dad: He was in the other room. Yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. He's gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. We'd be fighting every year with someone new if we didn't pick our battles. We would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. My dad is the only one who isn't petty about dumb shit. Defending my mom is everyone's responsibility not just my dad. Including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. As soon as I got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (I can't describe it). There wasn't much for him to say or do because he didn't hear it. I was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. My white side has a ""keep grandma"" happy approach which is dumb. For years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn't. 

Me: Reflecting on this as a whole. I can't believe the response. It shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. After Thanksgiving I started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. I have no relationship with this aunt. I should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who's 30 years younger. A small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. If she's not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), ""F*ck her"".  Please don't use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. I should have tried to speak and I did what I felt was right, I don't regret it.. Grandma's 80th Bday is in two months.  I can't wait for that to be awkward. Someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. Regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. Cheers and have a Happy New Years!

[Update 12/29/18]
I wrote a letter to my aunt explaining further how I felt and I didn't want this to affect how our family gatherings. I explained for years she's treated my mom like an outsider in how she talks to my mom. I told her if she speaks to my mom a littler nicer she will get nothing but respect from me. I told her I wished I had a better relationship to tell her this years ago. I told her I want nothing in return but her to be nicer to my mom. I'm leaving how we move forward in her hands.

I called my grandma to let her know I sent a letter to my aunt to try and fix things. I told her I didn't want this to ruin our family gatherings. My grandma apologized for not saying something earlier to my aunt. I was right for standing up for my mom. Also.. this was amazing, my grandma told me ""I never wanted your mom to ever feel like an outsider in our family"" 
 
TLDR: After 32 years I finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my Korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something I've been feeling for years. How do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. Should I do something for blowing up?

UPDATE: My wife (30F) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. I (30M) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. Our relationship is not sustainable and I need help.,"EDIT:  [Here is the original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/azwevy/my_wife_30f_suffers_from_extreme_germophobia_and/), for those that havent seen it

&#x200B;

Its been awhile since my original post, but I didnt want to post until there was substantial progress.

Since then, not much has improved. I decided to convince her to attend out patient behavioral therapy. To my surprise, she agreed and I was so happy.

Unfortunately, she refused to attend the session last night and became violent and suicidal.  I had no choice but to get the police involved and have her committed to in patient therapy.

This was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  I feel so broken right now.  I'm going to see a counselor in hopes that I can figure out what to do.

I dont know how long they are going to keep her in patient yet but I pray that she takes advantage of it because I still love her and I did this because I still do.

I told myself I would stop enabling her, mainly because I just cannot sustain this life. I am physically and mentally exhausted.  My kids are my top priority but I cant take care of them if I dont first take care of myself.

I thank all of you who reached out to me on the original post and and recommended things to try. She was set to attend group cognitive behavioral therapy today and I hope that it will help her.

Thanks for reading.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I[19M] recently found out that my older sister[34F] is actually my biological mother.,"Link to original:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bw8dsa/i19m\_recently\_found\_out\_that\_my\_older\_sister34f/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bw8dsa/i19m_recently_found_out_that_my_older_sister34f/)

&#x200B;

Ok so I first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200B;

So after a week of avoiding I came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. She was happy to see me and I told her to sit down because we need to talk.

I started things with saying that I know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. Her face turned red and she started crying like hell. She knew what I was talking about. I told her the story about the DNA test, about Jennet and basically what I told you guys in the last post.

Well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. She told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. He didn't really care about a future kid and was like ""yeah whatever"". Apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery. 

She told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. When the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. After a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. As they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. She tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when I started crying. She started crying too. The couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. Rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. Police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. We were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. It took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

Rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(They came to their senses after a day or so). She reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. She made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

A few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. After so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. He met me a few times and I knew him as one of Rose's old friends from the park. He helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. Ironically I'm glad I got to know him before he passed, even if I didn't know who he really is. 

&#x200B;

BTW, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200B;

So after hearing this I told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and I told her I understand she did the right thing. I pulled out an ""It's a boy!"" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and I headed off to my parents(ADOPTIVE) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200B;

I'm glad she is my mother. I feel for the first time in years - complete. I don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and I honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't. Thanks Reddit for helping me getting my feelings straight and helping me out mentally to coop with everything that happened!",relationship_advice
[Update] My ex girlfriend committed suicide.. I am a firefighter and had to find her body,"Its been a bit over 6 months since I posted that story and I want to give you a quick update on my life. Im on mobile so I apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 TL;DR My ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. She was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. I am a firefighter in NJ, but go to school in NH. I received the call and conducted research to find her. I drove back down to help with the search. We found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


Where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. I was in a dark place for a while after that. I drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. For a good amount of time I distanced myself from any girl who I met.

The funeral wasnt long after and Jim didnt even show up. Im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


I didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. It felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. The depression i felt was destructive.

My chief reached out to me not long after because I never told him how I knew her. He asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. I was in NH so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

I lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. I had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

After 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. I met this really nice girl named Sarah. We talked  and even hooked up a couple times. After a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. I told her i couldnt. I told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. She took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. I felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. I didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

Fast forward another month my friend Kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. I accepted and thats when i met Kristen. Kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. We ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. I opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. She completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

She convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. So i made an appointment and went. The therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. I joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

I did my first story and Kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. It was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. I continued doing these events and Kristen went to every single one. 

After 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. She understood. Weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. Shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

Every time im in NJ i go to Lydias house and support her mom. On Christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews.

I (21F) found a hidden camera in my house. I suspect my SIL (26F) put it there to watch me while I babysit my nephew (1M). What do I do?,"I babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm Mon-Fri for free because a) I love my brother and nephew and b) I'm already a SAHM for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, I have everything he needs already at home and I love kids. 

The spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. There is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv I found a weird circular object with a lens in it. After some googling I found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. I flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. He vehemently denied it and suggested I called the police and explain to them that I need a bug check. The only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my SIL; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and Bro and our parents only come on the weekends. I suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. Another reason I suspect SIL is because I had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" It could be a coincidence, but now that I found the camera I'm not so sure.


If it's her, she knows I know since I'm assuming she saw me find it. What do I do? Do I confront her and ask if its hers? I couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; I have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. I would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care I take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course I treat my nephew the same.",relationship_advice
[Update] Overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

So I read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, I was doubting if I made the right decesion. I wasn't going to update because I didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days I came to a final conclusion.I want to clarify that I broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

After I broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. She would send me letters and call me a lot. In one of the texts I actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. Without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. I was about to agree, but something she said made me realize I would be making a mistake if I did. She said, ""I'll remember to respect from now on."" That sentence made me realize that I made the right choice by breaking up. Since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

Either way I'm glad I didn't give her a second chance. I don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

On a sidenote, the other day I was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and I guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that I moved on to fast. Blocked her and had a laugh I know for a fact I made the right choice.",relationship_advice
"This morning I (27M) found out my gf (27F) cheated on me, where to go from here?","So our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but I asked my boss if I could come in late as I had some stuff I had to do. However I went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. She gave me a key to her apartment and when I went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




As soon as I walked in she saw me and burst into tears. The guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. I freaked out at first and the guy left. She kept asking what are you doing here, I thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. I tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. Eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



I took the flowers and the gift and left. I'm sitting at work right now because if I went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





We've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. I was looking up rings. She said it's because I was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. She thought I wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. I asked if there were any others but she said no. Idk what to believe at this point. 




The kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. We had lunch and got a hotel room together. We had dinner at my place with my folks and I dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. I trusted her for fucks sake.




 How and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? What am I supposed to do from here?



TL;DR spent valentines day morning learning my girlfriend is a cheater and the details of that cheating, sitting at work staring at my screen 




*edit at roughly 1:30PM. : I broke up with her, I told her I'll be by later to get my shit and to have it ready. I'll be taking her stuff over and giving her back her key.*

"[Serious] My (35M) girlfriend (24F) wants me to act like a horse when we have sex, and I'm not into it at all.","So, tiny bit of backstory, my girlfriend of 6 months loves horses, has all her life. An additional, seemingly relevant point is, during sex, she sometimes says stuff like 'f*** me with that horse cock'. I've never thought much of it, I thought that was just a way of her saying it's big. But she's started to take it further and it's turned into a bit of a fetish that I'm not entirely comfortable with. A few days ago, she told me she wanted to roleplay, and at first I was pretty on board, but then she said as horses. I laughed, thinking it was a joke and she took it the wrong way, and said she was tired and then went to sleep. I said fuck it and, trying to make her feel better, said I'd do it the following day. Honestly it was okay but very, very weird, she got so into it and said it was the best she ever had, and next time wanted to buy costumes, and maybe do it on some hay. I told her no, and I didn't want to do it again and she's back to being mad at me. Am I being a dick here? I don't know what to do.

"Me (M34) and fiancee (F27), I am in the process of calling a halt to our wedding as she has asked for an ""open"" relationship.","Alright folks where to start, this one is tough to type and the paws are shaking as I'm doing it. As it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. I'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (I only found  out because one of her friend's BF contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). I confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. I'll be totally honest in saying that I'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. I manned up, moved on and proposed (which I had planned on doing anyway). This is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to recent time. We are due married in November (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. Distant, not herself, away with the fairies. Even stopped having sex, which was very strange. I put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. Forward to Christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. I confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. I was very considerate, and tried to help her through it. 

&#x200B;

However, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. I arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. The vibe was bad guys, I could tell. We sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. At this rate I was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. Basically, a few of her friends had back in October (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an ""open relationship""...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. I'll be honest, the idea made me ill. I said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. Pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........I got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. I wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. We got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. I basically said that I needed some headspace, and that I'd spend the weekend at my mates. It was quick after that, and I left without a fuss. I'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. I am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. I suppose if anyone has been in a similar place I could do with some advice

My son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family,"I'm going to preface this by saying I love all three of my sons equally. They are 29, 24 and 22. It is my unequivocal truth.

It's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

After years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and I have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. We let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

I disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but I have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

After losing literally everything after my divorce, I have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. All three of our sons work in the business.

A week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. I was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. My oldest son managed to see it.

Our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. My oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

I feel like I have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. My ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

If she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

The plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

My son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. He stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and I. Our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

I am devastated. I have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him I want the will to be changed to split everything equally. But the damage is done.

He's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). His brothers and my wife and I are so hurt hearing this. It couldn't be any further than the truth. It's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

He has refused to come in to work since the past week and I've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

I don't know how to fix this. He won't take my calls.

My ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on Facebook that I am considering legal action over. But I know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

I'm not sure how to salvage this. And I am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. My younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. It's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. My wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

TL;DR My oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. But now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after I have tried to fix it.",relationship_advice
I(21) found out my whole family was going on a vacation when I was told to look after the family pet.,"My siblings have yet to move out of from our childhood home and I've been of to uni. 

I am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. I've been trying to act like I didn't care but when they were driving to the airport I couldn't stop crying. My mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. Last time we went to a family vacation was when I was around 13. I cried so much I had cramps in my abdomen.

I wrote them a message trying to make them understand what I was feeling and that it hurt me alot. I got back that I was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. They said they thought I wanted to be ""free"". I know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions I've tried to hide come through. I've never felt this left out and I feel like I'm not a family member. I'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on Holliday.
I feel heartbroken.

My plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to Uni and dive into school to forget.

How can I forgive them? Has this happened to anyone else?

Edit: 



I would have paid for myself. This is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. They brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. They are all there. The whole family. They brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. I would not have batted an eye if only my sister went. 

I am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. I've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that I need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

I'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and I send all the hugs in the world to you! The feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




Edit 30 juli: 

I just wanted to say that I've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that ""being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips"" I believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. My mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that I wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

For anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. Going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. Being away from family is hard and I missed mine alot. Being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. Please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.",relationship_advice

I (29 F) am letting my baby be adopted so I can give him a better more stable life with two parents. After he is born I will be going to a mental health facility to try to get myself better.

UPDATE: I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.,"&#x200B;

[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

I've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. I've also read through a lot of the comments. Thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. There's been A LOT of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. It's whatever at this point.

We had been texting off and on all evening. As promised, I agreed not to bring it up in person. When I got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. I was a little nervous not knowing what I might be walking into, but overall I just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. When I walked in it was clear so did she. Her sister was helping her pack up her things. I didn't know what to say, but I never expected this. I honestly thought everything was going to be okay when I got home. Her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

I walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. She didn't say anything either. She didn't even look at me. If she was going to leave I at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. Everything I had read in the comments about buying a bidet and OCD lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than I had considered. I started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. ""YOU PUT THIS ONLINE? I TOLD YOU TO NOT TALK ABOUT IT!"" Her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. She then accused me of cheating. WHAT? This whole thing has been crazy and I feel like I had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. I snapped.

I told her sister I had never cheated. Not once. I would never cheat on her. Enough was enough, so I told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier I had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. Everything went silent. Like, no one said a word. Out of nowhere they both start crying. Her sister stared yelling at me and told me I shouldn't be talking about things I don't understand. When I asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that I need to mind my own business.

1. Her sister knows about it. (She did not know I posted on Reddit about it)
2. Her sister thinks it's normal.
3. I need to mind my own business? They're MY SOCKS!

I stood there all kinds of messed up so I just left. I went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. I also called off work today. I went home and all her stuff is gone. I didn't text her back. I think I'm done.

To clarify a few things: She insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. She told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. She reaffirmed it's not a fetish. She won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. I can't keep up with the comments. I'm pooped. (I'm trying to find humor in this because I'm really upset :(

So yeah.

Edit: (a sentence) Her sister did not previously know I posted about it on Reddit. I'm sure they both do now. ",relationship_advice
My gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn't like where I proposed.,"I decided to propose to my gf of three years on our three year anniversary. I flew her to Vietnam and after a couple of weeks traveling we ended up in Cambodia. She had wanted to see Angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. After a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together I proposed and she said yes. We kissed and I had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. It's really beautiful. She took a shower and I laid in bed thinking what an amazing day I just had and how I would get to spend the rest of my life with the women I loved. When she came out of the shower however she was in tears. She handed me back the ring saying she couldn't accept it because she didn't want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

I played it cool and said I understood but truthfully it hurt. It seems to me that I had offered her something of value. A lifelong commitment and partner. I took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. I felt that if she valued me it wouldn't matter that the proposal wasn't exactly what she wanted. It was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. If she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn't throw it back because of where it came from. So she can't possibly value me or what I have to offer as an individual if she's willing to reject it because she didn't like the place I asked. 

I'm preparing to end things when we get back. She wants me to propose again and better and then she'll say yes, but I'm done. Am I wrong? Should I do it over? What do you think.

Any advice is appreciated.",relationship_advice
My (f 20) mother (f 37) tells me if I don't be her surrogate she'll cut me out of her life forever.,"My mother and her new husband want to have a baby. She's still young so she still is fertile however both of her past pregnancies were complicated and very dangerous. So her doctor told her to absolutely not get pregnant as it will just be even more risky now that she's older. She told me all of this this morning, and then she asked me to be her surrogate. She said all I have do is carry her egg and have it fertilized by her husband. I told her I can't do that. For one, I'm trying to get my nursing degree and I don't want anything to slow me down. And I already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there's no way I want to go through it again so soon. I'm also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it's still in the womb. I don't want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won't be mine. I gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me ""it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me"". She told me all she wants is another baby and that I shouldn't deprive her of it when I can help her so easily. I tried to reason with her but she literally told me ""if you don't do this to me then I don't want a relationship with you anymore"". I asked her if she was serious and she told me ""yes"" and left. I don't know what to do. My mom is very stubborn and very vindictive so she probably means it at least for now. I'm not sure how I should handle this. I think she's acting crazy.",relationship_advice
My (f 25) husband (m 28) said something disgusting to me,"I can't stop thinking of it. I've been in the bath for a long time because I've been dreading going to bed with him. 

A few hours ago I was lying in bed feeding our baby. My husband was begging me to come do something with him. I tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  He kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up. 

I just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

I could see he was starting to lose his patience and I told him ""Honey I have to take care of him before you, you know that"". And what he said back was really stunning. He looked me right in the eyes and said ""if you love him so much, why don't you suck his dick instead of mine"". I couldn't say anything, I didn't know what to say. And then he stormed out of our bedroom. 

I don't even know what to make of this. What should I do? It just bothers me so deeply, it's going to be hard for me to forgive. I really don't have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. Am I just being sensitive?

"My (36m) wife (33f) was sued, I'm feeling resentment towards her and I don't know how to move past it.","FWIW This is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. No offense to reddit, but I'd rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but I'm okay getting relationship advice it seems. 

As the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. The money is a significant amount for us, we didn't have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

My currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger I'm feeling towards my wife. Until now I've always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. But, since I'm the breadwinner I can't help but to feel like I'm spending ""my"" money on something that isn't my fault. I've had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. However, I have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where I know my wife is guilty. She has a part time job and doesn't make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

What did my wife do? (Note: I had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

She used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of 'recruiter'. My wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, ""Laura"" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. Laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but Laura gave her a personal email address instead. My wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as Laura at her company. These messages said derogatory things about Laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make Laura look bad. Her manager got one of these messages that claimed that Laura was a heavy drug user. Laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass Laura. Well, Laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. Not only that, but Laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. My wife didn't know this at this point, but Laura was pregnant. Several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on Laura behalf. 


Using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms Laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. She did some more internet sleuthing and found Laura's husband on facebook. Laura's husband didn't have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. My wife sent him an email claiming that Laura was cheating on him. The husband confronted Laura about this email and Laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  My wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that Laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. What she didn't realize was Laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. Some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. She also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. Laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


My wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. One of Laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. My wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) She did not make herself known immediately. Instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. She was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about Laura - my wife was telling people that Laura didn't actually know who the father was, among other things. This was at an event where her husband was at as well. The word got back around to Laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


I'm leaving a fair amount of information out - My wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in Laura circle and sent them messages about Laura on multiple occasions. All the messages were trying to paint Laura in an extremely derogatory light. All the events I've mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  My wife didn't think to mask her IP address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same IP address, ours. Many of Laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, Laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


Laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. They had ample evidence against her. All the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. She even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife's accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


I honestly felt awful for Laura, there were lots of tears on her end. You could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. She said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. She was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. And that my wife's harassment continued even after Laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


My wife has never done anything this crazy before. I knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. We've had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. But, she really fucked up this time. I don't know how to move forward. I know someone is going to suggest therapy, but I really want to start building up an emergency fund again. We're pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


**tl;dr** Wife was sued by her former best friend, I emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. I need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. Funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. What can we do to move forward?",relationship_advice

My (26M) girlfriend (24F) found an engagement ring I was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. She thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't.,"I've been dating my girlfriend Laura for just over two years. We met as I was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. We have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and I love her a great deal. She's definitely been the healthiest relationship I've ever had and I see a strong future with her. 

This weekend has been awful, however. My best friend Rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend Grace of about seven years. The problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. I offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. I hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last Monday when he asked for it back. He (successfully!) proposed to Grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

Literally five minutes after she posted, Laura rang me absolutely fuming. She told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had I given it to Rob for Grace when I'd clearly chosen it especially for her? Was Grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd ""stolen"" her ring? I tried to talk her down and explain that I'd just been keeping it safe for Rob and that I'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that I'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. She hung up on me, then texted me that I had three months to propose to her with ""a better ring than Grace's"" or she's going to break up with me. 

Am I wrong for thinking this is a red flag? I know that she probably was really excited and I absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. We don't live together and I don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. More than that, I am 100% not ready for marriage. We've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. I want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged. 

What do I do? I totally understand why she'd be upset but I just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that I'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. This is the first big fight we've had and I'm not sure if I'm just seeing red flags because I'm hurt, or if they're really there. 

TL;DR: Girlfriend snooped and found a ring that I was keeping safe for a friend. She's angry that the ring wasn't for her, is demanding a proposal by Valentine's day or the relationship's off. Need help determining what my next move should be.",relationship_advice
The way I (21f) met my boyfriend (20m) is a bit cringy. How do i tell people when they ask,"So I met my boyfriend a year ago. I posted on my cities subreddit that I was lonely, i liked videogames and wanted to meet somebody.

I got about 50 messages all together. One guy responded that he liked fallout new vegas. I love that game so we exchanged messages about the game. I gave him my number and we texted all night. Our first phone call was over an hour.

He told me he was also lonely. I mentioned how i wanted a cuddle badly. He offered to cuddle me. We decided to have a cuddle date

We met up the following week. He picked me up from my local cafe and took me to his. We got into bed and cuddled for 3 hours.

That's how we met. I know it sounds a little cringy, but to me it wasn't. People have asked how we met and I've told the truth, though an abbreviated version, and people tend to give me a weird look.  I don't want to lie, but is there a way to say it without it coming across cringy?",relationship_advice
"My childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. Except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. [NSFW]","[UPDATE HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

So, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, Sarah [31F], my long-time partner, John [34M], and myself [29F].

I've known that Sarah has had a crush on John for a long time. It's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, Sarah has never crossed any boundaries. But because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(My boyfriend and I had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

Apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

Which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while I'm sleeping. She took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. She apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

I found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

Now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad I'm being abused.

But here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. He took the photos and videos *for me*. The day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so I can watch them because it's better than porn. 

But nobody believes me. They're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. I don't know what to do. I'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

How do I fix my friendships and convince everybody that **I'M** the one who wanted it? 

There is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but I do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. I'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

Please help. I'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

Edit: since this needs to be said, YES, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. It's a four digit code.

Edit edit: 

- yes, I *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- I have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. Just *mostly* everybody. I was upset and generalizing last night.

- I am in the US.

- my boyfriend **DOES HAVE A PASSCODE** on his phone. Seriously. Stop blaming him. This is *definitely* not his fault.

Edit AGAIN since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and I: we attended a BBQ where EVERYBODY left their phones inside. We *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

You guys are being a little mean about this.

**Edit** (again): 

Went to the police and will update when I can.

## MINOR UPDATE 

I went to the police last night, alone. After everything that was said, I was nervous about having John with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

Really. Y'all made me nervous.

I went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

At first, the officer at the window was like, ""I think that's a crime? Maybe? I've gotta call my supervisor.""

That happened twice before the police were like, Okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. We're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

I gave my report and left. About fifteen minutes later, I got a phone call from the local PD. They told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

My comments being that Sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue John and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

They suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. Well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, I'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

So, that's about it. 

A bunch of hemming and hawing and I don't knows. They'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

I'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.",relationship_advice
Update: My[M25] girlfriend[24] of 1.5 years broke up with me to be with my roommate[M25]. I just heard them through the wall.,"It's been about a month since my post, unfortunately the mods deleted it from /r/relationships.

> As the title says, we broke up. It was about 6 months ago and it was semi-amicable. We broke up because she was developing feelings for my roommate. Admittedly they are more compatible and he's an upgraded version of me, so I can see why it happened.
> 
> This isn't an evil thing, both asked my permission to start dating and don't do any PDA while I'm around. I still both consider them friends and I just want them to be happy.

> For the most part, they are quiet at night. If I really listen I can hear whats going on, but they generally save it for when they are alone. Except for last night. We went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. I was the DD because I don't really drink. Anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. I made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. I then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. As I was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. She thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when I was ready. When I finally got to bed I could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. Then it got quiet and then it started.

> TL;DR: My ex and roommate are sleeping together and they were loud last night.

Taking everyone's advice I announced that I was going to be moving out. My now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. I told him yes, but I'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. He decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. It's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. My landlord is XRMs(ex-roommate) family friend, after XRM explained the situation I ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year. 

XRM and XGF and a few other friends helped me move in. I had a house warming party and was specifically asked that I not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. XRM and XGF also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. My XGF stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. She said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. She told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. It was great. We've gone out a few times since our first date. 

The past few weeks have been the best in a long time, I never really realized how bad my situation was. Obviously everything isn't perfect, and I still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but I'm in an infinitely better position than before.  

TL;DR: I moved out and started dating a new girl. ",relationship_advice
UPDATE: My [20] fiance's [27m] behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as I felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. A lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

I spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who I am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. She expressed some concern and agreed that I should speak with fiance's brother. Fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. That Sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because I went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because I didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. I got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because I was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. I just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. I knew that something really needed to change.

The next day fiance left for work and I left for school just as usual. I called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and I basically told him that I had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that I was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. Fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. Then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if I wanted to speak with him. I was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. I hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. I was extremely nervous and felt like I was doing something sneaky and horrible, but I needed to know what was going on. I spoke with his manager and learned that he had QUIT his job weeks ago!! He told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. WTF! So I guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. After work I went home and fiance was gaming. I told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. He finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. I was literally shaking at this point and told him that I was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. I said that I was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. I said that I was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. At this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. So I did something stupid and stood in front of the TV and said that I knew about him quitting his job to game all day. He FLIPPED OUT. He got violent and pushed me away from the TV. There was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). I got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. He eventually came and apologized. He offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. I literally felt sick. I locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. He literally just kept gaming until I went to sleep.

The next day I couldn't go to school because I had a bad black eye, it was not something I could explain away. I wanted to just disappear. I got on the bus and went to the women's center. My cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad I looked. I was very adament that I don't want to press charges or anything, I just needed help with the next steps of getting away. The social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. She helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while I drafted and sent fiance a text stating that I cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. He called me nearly 20 times during the time I was at the center. I didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. For the short term I am staying with my cousin and her husband and I'm working on finding an apartment. Next month I'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. I still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like I'm living in a nightmare. But for the past week or so I haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. I've also gone to bed before 11 every night. Someone on here sent me a PM saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so I'm just glad I was able to get away when I did. 

I don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and I just wanted to put this out here.",relationship_advice

RM= roommate's mom   R=Roommate

I came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and RM and R were in the kitchen making some coffee. She has never been there this early before. 

I decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. I atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (In brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points I listed:

1. I appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but I want to do that on my own. I love to cook and felt that I was never allowed in my own kitchen. I also told her that I want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. I don't want her in my room. I reminded her that I talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why I put the lock on the door.

3. I told her that if she wants to be with R, to let R text me and lmk that RM would be in the apartment. 

They expressed understanding and I hugged it out with RM. 

Before going to class, I put a load of laundry. My friend is having a birthday dinner today, and I decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. I asked RM multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. I told her that I would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when I finish mine later this afternoon if needed (I didn't want her touching my clothes). She was okay with it and said R didn't have laundry today. Cool. I left feeling really relieved, but I still locked my bedroom door. 

I got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and I couldn't find my white dress. As soon as I came home, R looked nervous. My clothes were in the dryer, and I didn't do that for a fact. RM states that I put them in the dryer and just forgot. Ughhh. I locked myself in my room, and I know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

When I was in my room, I heard RM talking to R in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. In India, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" And she went on to tell R that I won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

I honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? I'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

I'm heading over to my parents right now and I'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. I'll keep you posted.

I (36M) think my wife of 8 years (31F) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42M),"Throw away for obvious reasons.

So my wife and I have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  At first it's good and we start communicating better.  

About three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for ""self care"". Alone.

Around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the ""bad guy"" and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

She starts telling her friends about ""Danny"" and how great he is for her ""self care"" but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says ""he only does couples"" or ""he's not taking new clients""which I think is weird because we have normally referred to him as ""Dr. Soandso"" and now he is suddenly ""Danny"".  (I don't know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

Around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and I were intimate.

There have been a couple of other weird coincidences that I thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  She went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  It was about 9;30 at night and that seemed REALLY odd to me.

About a half hour later I tracked her iPhone and the location showed up as his office.

When she came home 3 hours later, I asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird ""oh you know Jenny, drama queen"" kind of answer.

I think I'm going to confront them in the session this Thursday.",relationship_advice
UPDATE My [42M] daughter [14F] won't get an abortion,"Yesterday I posted [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ds59s0/my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) but it got removed because I didn't have ""ThrowRA"". I've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. Because the original was deleted, you can read it here:

**ORIGINAL** 

I \[42M\] am a single father to my daughter \[14F\]. My wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. She's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. She doesn't see too much of me because I work 9-7, but I'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

Around Tuesday, I noticed there was something off about her. She was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. Right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch TV together. I figured it was just moody teenage hormones. Except it doesn't stop. Friday I finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. She looked at me and just burst into tears. She cried more, so I held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""I'm pregnant.""

I was shocked. Utterly and completely shocked. I kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. I took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. I didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, I'd wait until she calmed down a little. Saturday she came down for breakfast and I sat her down and asked her her plans. She said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. I then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. I calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? I go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. She suggested she start online school, which I refused, saying I don't want her to ruin her life.

The thing is, I don't even want to consider adoption. I can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. I don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if I lose her?I told her this, and she asked me if I had no love for my grandchild. But I don't. I don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, I care about her. The girl I raised. I told her today that she had to abort her child. She cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. There's no way I'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. And for school, I don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

At this point, I see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, I'm kicking her out. It hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, I'm afraid her life will truly be over. I won't actually, but I'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. I'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do I get out of this?

Where do I go from here?

TL;DR: My daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**UPDATE**

So today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. It's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. Everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. They said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

After the doctor's I took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. I told her I had to know, she had to tell me. She refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. We went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so I took it and looked through her messages. According to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. She hadn't told him yet.   
I wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him I was \[daughter's name\] dad, and I needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. I expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so I called his mom and I told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. She asked if I was sure, and I said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. I said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. She said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. I asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. She asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. She hung up before I could say anything else. 

Now I don't know where I stand. I can't afford a lawyer, and I don't think I can make him get involved either way. I don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. Is there a way they could get out of paying it? I don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

My daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but I'm going to stop peppering her with it now. My sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and I hope a female influence will work better on her than I am. She's sending a little bit of money, and I think I may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and I can do.

EDIT: Thank you everyone so much for commenting. I expected maybe a dozen comments and I've got hundreds of PM's. Thank you all so much for your help. I'm not sure what the rules of updating are, but if it's possible I'll update as soon as I can.",relationship_advice
Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"I literally do not know what to do. This is long, **TL;DR** at bottom.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  She's always been one of the most amazing people I've ever met. No huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. That's why this is so difficult for me.

We've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  She's in marketing and I work independently as an IT consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  We decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  We've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

Long story short, I was diagnosed with azoospermia last December.  Blockage in the pipes just meant I wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. It's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this July.  She's got a high sex drive as do I, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way I could have gotten her pregnant.

She missed her period this week.  I couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  The babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  She took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

At first I was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. She's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. I'm not the jealous type, but I'm literally stuck.  The doctors said this couldn't happen.  And I can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

My wife's been ecstatic. She's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. She was so excited when she first found out that I didn't express my worries then.  But she left for work and now I feel completely torn.  What if she did cheat?

Looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  Her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. She definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. She always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  I remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

Fuck man I don't know what to do.  I set up an appointment on Monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  If it is mine and I accuse her of cheating I feel like the world's biggest asshole. But she's coming home in a few hours and I don't know what I'm going to say to her, I can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and I just didn't see it.

Do I wait until the doctor appointment Monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? I'm worried I won't be able to hide what's going on.

**TL;DR:  Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July.  Wife got pregnant anyways.  It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.  Want to wait until Monday, but don't think I can hide it.  What do I tell her?**

**Edit:**  I should add I've been cheated on before.  Our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  I'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**Edit** I really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  My wife's coming home though in an hour and I have to decide if I'm going to put on a happy face until Monday or not.

**Edit** She texted saying she's going be home late

This is bringing up some old emotional scars I think and is just fucking with me.  I'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  I think I need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

My [25M] girlfriend[29] suggested about having a FFM threesome. I was skeptical at first and politely turned it down but gave in when she kept on talking about how awesome it would be. Now she is giving me a hard time because I accepted the idea and didn't deny strongly. Am I being manipulated?,"Hello all,
A few days ago my[25M] girlfriend[29] suggested that we should have a threesome with another girl.

Knowing her, I disagreed at first. She kept on insisting and I gave into the idea. I cherished the idea and we started talking about how we are going to get this done.
A few hours later she blocked me on messaging and was not responding to my calls. Then when I finally reached her she was crying. She seemed broken. She told me that I didn't deny her strong enough. She told me that had I ever insisted on having a threesome with another guy, she would have denied it. She was mad and we broke up because I didn't deny her strongly.
Basically, I feel as if she set up a trap and is now giving me a hard time for it..
I feel that I am being manipulated. Dear reddit, please help me out. Thanks.

UPDATE (2 weeks after the post): First off, Thanks a lot for this overwhelming response. The comments and messages helped through this turbulent time. Thanks a lot.

We had a lot of talks but the chances of something like this happening again felt high. So, I decided to break off this relationship as the whole ordeal took a mental toll on both of us. No clue about her intentions though, but I am at a much better place. Thank you reddit!",relationship_advice
Update: She[20f] lost her virginity while we were taking a break,"Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f\_lost\_her\_virginity\_while\_we\_were\_taking\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f_lost_her_virginity_while_we_were_taking_a/?sort=new)

Hey guys. First of all, thank you all so much for your responses, it really did affect me.

So, long story short, 3 days ago I ""broke up"" with her for good.

Now, you guys might not agree with the way I did it, but I did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. Even though I am sad and disappointed, at the same time I understand she wanted to see other options and I respect she didn't outright cheat on me. That being said, I am also not a backup plan and I deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

I didn't see her anymore and I finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""Hey \[name\], first of all, I don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. I took some days to think about it and I realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and I would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. I understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. Sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. I respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. I wanted to thank you for all those years and I wanted to apologize for any wrongs I did to you. I want you to know that I am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. I hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. Goodbye, op""

The message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but I realized I am already getting over it and that I no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. She replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. So, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, I am almost certain that I would accept her back. So yeah, until next time.",relationship_advice
My [45M] Wife [42F] revealed she was unfaithful and I'm divorcing her. Our children [15F & 17M] hate me for it.,"Edit: Guys, I appreciate the advice. But I'm not asking on how to get past the infidelity. I've made my decision, and it's not something I'm willing to forgive. I'm looking for advice on how to handle this with my kids, and how to reassure them we can still be a family even if we aren't married.

My wife and I have been together for 18 years. We had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. We've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

About two weeks ago I brought up an advice column in the paper I had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and I could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so I asked her what was bothering her. She confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. This was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. She says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. Claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. We talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. I realized I knew I'd never be able to let this go, nor would I be able to forgive her. She's distraught.

We sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. Obviously this was extremely tough. They acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. My wife and I agreed to tell them it was mutual, but I guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. This had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. My wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. I don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so I'm being trying to explain as tactfully as I can, but they're gone as far as saying that when I get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that I still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. My wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since I've told her of my plan to leave.

I love my kids, but I don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. I don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that I'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. I just know that I cannot get past this, and for my own happiness I need to leave. Any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

Tl;dr wife revealed past infidelity. I'm leaving. Kids hate me for it.",relationship_advice
[Update] Dad left us and a decade later wants to reconcile because he has cancer. Am I wrong to be angry?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ax9pfk/dad_left_us_and_a_decade_later_wants_to_reconcile/)

You guys are right. I can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. I resent this man so much. I can't stand the sight of him. 

After I posted yesterday, I was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. To no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. I picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. I heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but I didn't bring up any of our hardships. My mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. I did, I forgave him but that doesn't mean I need to have a relationship with him anymore. Again, my family protested that I'm being cruel and heartless. I'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. I told them I would not be present at any family events if he was there.

My sister shouted at me claiming ""He is our dad. You asshole"". Yes he is, to which I replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. I told them I had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. My sisters need to return the iPhone's that are on contract as I am cancelling those. Driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that I pay for. These are dad's responsibilities now. Ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

I have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. I need a break.

I'm done. I'm done taking over dad's role. I'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. I'm 25 and I need to live my own life now. I don't think this will burn bridges. It's just a wake up call for them.

Edit: I'm not going to ghost or abandon them. They need to become independent now. 

Edit:  I'm reading all the comments. I know I have acted like a jerk. I just need some time to collect my thoughts. I might update later.",relationship_advice
"[FINAL UPDATE] My [29M] fiancee [28F] of 4 years randomly claimed I abused her, and called the police. This came completely out of the blue.","Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)  
Update post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

So firstly thanks for all of your input. I read and considered every single reply. First I'll update you, then I'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. I want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, I'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and I feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

Update: 

I spoke to her in person after I posted my update. From her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. Her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. She was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""I don't know, I'll probably tell him that I feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. Then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

I said great, all that is understandable. Just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

She said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

I thanked her for telling me, and then I called off the wedding entirely. 

She cried, I cried, it was a goddamn mess. She asked where we go from here. I told her I don't know. I don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but I know that the engagement is over, and that **if** I decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. And now I have to decide if **I** want that. Do I went to spend another 4 years being undecided? If I'm being honest with myself, I imagine it taking another couple of years before I can trust her again. Do I want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? Close to 40? 

I told her that I have a lot to think about. 

I spoke to her dad last night. We shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. My ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. She's been crying a lot. I do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

Her dad caught wind of the situation on Facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. He'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. She told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. He told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. He said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

So that's it. I still have a lot to think about. I know a lot of you guys are telling me that I have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that I still love her and have loved her for a few years now. Right now, I'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

As for my reputation, nobody thinks I'm an abuser. It's firmly out there now. Her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit. I haven't lost any friends, except for the idiot social media girl (whose reputation also took a severe hit), nobody called the cops, all the other posts about it have been deleted...everything is good. There's no real need for me to get a lawyer and sue anybody. 

My family agrees with a lot of you. They're 2 seconds away from slapping me upside me head for not immediately kicking her to the curb. Just give me some time. I'm not going to make another update post, because I've already wasted too much of your time with this bullshit, but maybe I'll just update this post in a few days after I've decided what to do.",relationship_advice
I was forced into sex work from 12-14. People at school know because the people who forced me into it were arrested and I went into foster care.

[SERIOUS] I (26m) can't handle being a single parent. Should I give my daughter (3f) up for adoption?,"My girlfriend passed away two years ago unexpectedly. It was all far to quick for me to process. We were both estranged from our parents. It was hard work raising our child together but we were happy. I just can't cope anymore. I'm finding it too difficult to raise a child on my own. I work all day with two different jobs, most of that going on childcare. I spend maybe a few hours a day with her before I put her to bed. I'm ashamed to say, I don't know if I want her. I love her but I just can't handle all this pressure on my own.

If anyone has been in a similar situation, I would love to hear what you have to say.

Edit: Thank you for all the comments and replies. I am so grateful for all the support. The advice you have provided is amazing.


> It really looks like OP is only considering this for financial reasons.

I'm in debt because of I can't afford to provide the basic necessities for my daughter. I live off paychecks and take cash in hand jobs. I skip meals. I don't regret any of it. I would take a bullet for her. This is a really hurtful comment. I just want her to have a better childhood than I did.

I want to clarify this. I don't know if I will be a good dad. I'm not the model dad. No real education and a criminal record to my name.

"My ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), I was starting to heal until I found out the reasons why he ghosted.","The past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

My ex, 'Tom', and I had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so I thought. We had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). I was happy, and I thought he was too. We had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, I could go on. 

Everything was fine until our last trip together. We went to a destination where I had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something I'd have to wait longer to do. It was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. Once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

After we landed (the last time I saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. I didn't think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. I tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn't respond. I started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. From there our communication basically broke down. I can't say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn't remove me from any social media. From that point I'd try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn't respond. After about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then I wouldn't hear from him for several more days. What hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with New Years, Valentine's Day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn't even wish me a happy whatever. 

I felt like I was going crazy. I had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  I was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. I stopped going out as much, and didn't really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. I found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse I could think of whenever I showed up somewhere without him. 

I eventually broke down, I contacted one of his good friends who I felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. I told her that Tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he's only sent me a few text messages and I have no idea what's going on. I told her I didn't know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that I needed to know about. She looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that Tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and I that I was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. This was soul crushing to hear and I felt humiliated and worthless. I told her this wasn't the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. She said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

Throughout March and April I felt like I was starting to heal some. I felt broken, but I started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. I told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. Then I found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

He had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. Not sure how long, but a little less than a year. I'm also hurt because I know the person he cheated on me with. She's an absolute garbage person. And I'm not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. She has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. I've heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the LGBT community and non-Christians. She is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn't need it. She somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government's eyes. I think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, I'm really not sure. I can't really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. I've always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. Not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can't help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. Her parents have paid for her car and I think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. She spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and I frequent and will interject herself into our outings. She has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

Tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew I wouldn't approve. Then he started to get high and then have sex with her. He felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn't enough for him to stop getting high with her. His intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. This woman hated my guts, and kept pushing Tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. He didn't want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

Tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. So she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. He came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

I only found out about this, because the same friend I had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that Tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that I deserved to know the truth in case he isn't forward with what happened. 

1. There is no way in hell that I'd get back together with Tom
2. I can't help but feel like absolute dog shit that Tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and I'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

I don't know what to do at this point. I'm dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. I don't know if I could contain my urge to slap him, or if I would just break down and sob. I was doing well from moving on from him. I was starting to feel happy again. Now, I think I'm back at square 1. I'm depressed and stressed out. 

Is there anything I can do? I kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over.",relationship_advice
My (25 F) boyfriend (24 M) of 5 years just disclosed to me that he does not believe women should be allowed to vote.,"Update: Hi everyone, I had no idea that this post would gain this much traction. I'm sorry that I haven't been responding, I posted late-ish last night and have been at work today so I haven't had a chance to read the majority of the comments that have poured in. I am still at work so I won't have time until later to read through everything.
I wanted to say thank you to everyone that has offered me support. It has really helped me get through all of the self-doubt I have been facing. He really had me questioning this entire situation and whether I was overreacting or not. I am going to confront my boyfriend later this evening. I can update again afterwards.
Thank you again to everyone that has shared words of support and advice, it truly means a lot. Even if my opinion isn't valid to him, at least it's valid to all of you!


I don't want to cause any political debates. If it's necessary for context: obviously I believe that women should be allowed to vote. 

I'm so confused, I don't know what to think. I'm not even sure if this is the proper sub but I just feel that I need some advice.

In the time I have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so I thought. Politics was never an issue between us at all. However he just admitted to me that over the past year he's grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are American) and that they should not be allowed to vote... He says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

I'm upset and I can't tell if I'm wrong to be upset about this because I know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now I just feel as though he doesn't even value my own input/views. He has assured me that he still thinks that I should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

This is a person I have been with for almost 5 years. We've talked about marriage. I don't know what to think. In all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and I can't imagine my life without him in it. But this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

Am I wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? As his girlfriend am I supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though I may (strongly) disagree? I can't tell if I'm overreacting to this or not. The whole situation has made me feel terrible and I'm so confused.",relationship_advice

This hurts me to my core to think that someone I wanted to spend forever with could do this to me. Out of all the women I've ever dated she was the one I was least worried about this happening with. 
She tells me that it was the biggest mistake she's ever made and how she regrets it, I just don't know if I can move on. 
We live together, have a dog, have built a life together which makes a breakup even more difficult. 
I just don't know what to do. I still love her to pieces  but idk if I can get past this. 
Do I still go on the trip with her? Do I try and make this work? I'm certainly holding off on the proposal for now.

Edit: singing out for a bit guys. Need to take some time and think things through and let my emotions stabilize. Get in the right mindset. We talked when I got home and drove home some additional points you guys pointed out. Thank you all for your comments, it's nice to see another point of view.",relationship_advice
I [F25] received a letter from my mother [F49] yesterday in the mail. I've never cried harder.,"So around a week ago I posted on Reddit that I was having issues with my mother. My husband and I took in my best friends two children after she past from cancer. We are now working on adopting them. She has been totally unsupportive and down right mean to my children, husband and myself. So I decided to take a step back from her.

I've been ignoring her phone calls and today get a letter in the mail addressed about a week ago. It broke my heart and I broke down in tears. Probably the most I've cried in so long.

It was such a heartbreaking letter. She said that ""I was a worthless space of a human"" and that ""Those kids would be better off in foster care then with me"". It was a full page of just insults. The one that really got to me was ""You've never accomplished anything and you've never made me proud"". I broke down that line. Throughout my life all I wanted was to make her proud.

I ended up booking an appointment earlier with my therapist just to let these emotions out. I'm glad that the kids nor my husband were home at that time. I talked to him last night and he just let me cry to him. He truly is my rock.

I truly can't believe my mother would do such a hurtful thing. It broke me down but now I have to pick myself up. I fully think this would be enough for me to cut her out of my life forever. Does anyone have any advice? Anyone ever cut a parent out forever?",relationship_advice
I(22M) Recently discovered My Dad (50M) choose me over my former Stepmother and Half-sister(17F) 6 years ago. Don't know how to process this.,"I was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. Both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. When I was sent to live with my dad, I was broken. I barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  I wasn't mad or angry. I was null of any kind of emotion. Basically I was alive but wasn't living. I kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. I was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. I was more social with my dad but I kept it to a bare minimum.  I had noting left to say to anyone. It took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. That's how withdrawn I had become.

Dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  When I experienced night- terrors, I would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  He drove me to all of my therapist appointments. He made sure I was eating properly. There were days, I would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. He literally went above and beyond for me. I hated the city that were living in. Because  I had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

I was so passive, it was scary. My therapist had told my dad that I was stuck in the victim's cycle; I didn't know how to get out. Because of this, I was bullied quite a bit. By the time I was 15, I had been to 3 different schools. It got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. I was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. Noting would motivate me.

Looking back, Dad did spoil me but at the time I wasn't aware of it. I was so in my own body that I barley acknowledged my surroundings.   If I asked my dad for a new bed spread, I would get me new one plus new furniture. My phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. I was grateful and thanked him. I did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. Again I was being polite. I didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. I barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

By the time I was 16, Dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. I didn't question it. He had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. I didn't think it was any of my business so I didn't press the issue. A year later, Dad had divorced my stepmother. One of Dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in Boston and he took it. We moved and I felt I was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. That year was probably the best year of my life. I was coming out of my shell. There was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. It was if I was like everyone else. I felt ""normal"". I became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, I was going out more. Us moving probably saved my life.

Because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. There was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. You could just sense it. It got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

Me and Dad have always been close. When I had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, I could see my dad crying in the crowd. I lived with my dad while I attended college ( I still do for the time being) . Ever since I was child, I always wanted to be a doctor. Well, I just finished my first year of medical school. Honestly, I feel like a normal young adult in society. I have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom I've been with for 4 years. I'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

Recently, I got FB message from my half-sister. She was apologizing a lot and I had no clue what she was talking about. Turns out, the reason why Dad and I moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what I was watching her change........... Yes. She told her mom that I was watching her change.. At the time, I was traumatized of sex. Heck I was terrified of any form of intimacy. The kid was envious of what Dad was doing for me. She was so envious that she tried to move me out. Well I guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and I'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. Because we moved out, I think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. How can someone be so cruel? What did I ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. I didn't even respond. More importantly, Dad never let this to get back to me. Chances are if I had heard about this when I was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. It also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

This is a lot to take in and I have a new found of respect and love for my dad. He gave up this marriage for me so I could live a normal life.Dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. I'm missing him a lot lately.

Should I bring it up to him when he returns? Also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? At the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and I almost want to help.

Tl;dr: Dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. Dad kept it from me for 6 years. Should I bring up with him?

Edit: I wasn't expecting such a huge response. I just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. It will take some time but I will read all of them or as much as I can. As I was going through the comments, I found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. This a part of my life. I don't normally like to talk about about this . Aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. The fact the people are saying that it's fake.... I don't what to say. It's not my place to try and convince anyone. Believe  me, they're times I wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. When I wrote this, I wasn't thinking about syntax. It was more just getting this out. People questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. Forgive me but I wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

As for how I became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; I did respond to it in the comments but I'll post it here too. 

""It was very unorthodox how I became valedictorian after attending a real HS for only a year. My overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because I was in online classes for my previous hears, I wasn't eligible at the time. I met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

I broke down in front of the coordinator and I told her the truth. Being named valedictorian was something I always wanted. To be that would have been my first accomplishment that I would have achieved based on my own merit. Yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. It wasn't trying to be Valedictorian financial reasons. Money wasn't a problem (Dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. This would have helped me self-worth as well.

The girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and I told her the truth. She actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. It something I'll forever be grateful for. That's actually how me and her became friends."". Not many people would do that and in HS. 

I'll be posting again. I just need a few days.",relationship_advice
My husband constantly bodyshames me.,"I was around 5'1 and 100 lbs when we got married and six years later, I'm 5'1 and 125 lbs. He constantly comments on my body and my weight even though I've never asked for his opinion.  I know my body isn't perfect, but I'm working on accepting that. 

Actual things he has said to me

1. (A day after I gave birth and was getting dressed in front of him) - [*disgusted tone and expression*] ""is your stomach going to stay like that?"" By the way it takes two weeks for the uterus to return to normal size

2. ""It's not baby weight when the baby is two years old.""

3. ""Your thighs are huge. When you sit down, they look even more enormous""

4. ""It's like you've lost the weight everywhere except for your hips. It's very noticeable from behind. I'll even take a photo and show you so you can see for yourself how fat your ass is""

5. ""I'm just motivating you to lose weight. 
Who else is going to tell you that you're fat?""

6. He even has a game he plays with our three year old daughter: 
 ""Who's the tall one?"" - her: ""daddy""
 ""Who's the cute one?"" - ""me!""
""Who's the fat one?"" - ""mommy!!"" and they both laugh at me. okay haha very funny.

7. ""Why do you keep trying on clothes if you're never going to buy anything? You keep saying it doesn't look good on you but the truth is that thin people (he meant women) don't need to try on clothing because they look good in everything. So maybe just lose weight before you go clothes shopping again.""

8. ""Short and fat isn't a good combination""

And so on. On average, he'll make 1-2 body shaming comments a week. I've talked to him about it but he says he just wants me to be healthy and fit. It's hurtful, and unhelpful, and unhealthy for my daughter to hear those comments from her dad about her mom.",relationship_advice
Update to My (22F) twin (22F) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends. Don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23M) of 8 months.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dckm1r/my_22f_twin_22f_has_slept_or_tried_to_sleep_with/

So I've made a lot of changes in my family life since I posted this a couple weeks ago. I first told everything to my boyfriend. He was shocked and assured me he'd never cheat on me with my sister or anyone else. He also respected that I didn't want her to meet him. 

I decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. She IMMEDIATELY noticed like within ten minutes after I'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so I didn't beat around the bush, I said yes because I didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. She tried to guilt trip me about how I hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like I knew they would). She exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but I hadn't even gotten a chance to say I was worried she'd do this. She said it first so what does that say?

I told her I flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. She called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. I can't reason with her. She just never sees the problem with anything she's done. The way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

I blocked her number, I still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. But we live hours apart, so I figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

Then, as for them, I also got a call from my mom soon after I blocked my sister who wanted to know what I was doing because she was upset. She'd already heard my sister's side which was just that I'd blocked her out of nowhere. So I tried to tell her my side. I did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like I said in the first post I'm not going to fall to petty revenge. I just want her to stop interfering in my life. So all I said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys I've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. My mom then wanted to know what I meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). She also got my dad on the call at this point. I told them the details didn't matter. She kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if I had been having premarital sex. It was really frustrating. 

I told them the point I'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. They began saying I should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. Well I'm not exactly fighting. I'm simply not going to be in contact with her. To them it's the same thing. 

Then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. I said I wasn't going to do that, that I'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. They said they'd come to me then. That brought up how they show up for random visits even when I've said I don't like it. I told them I didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again I wouldn't let them in or talk with them. So they flipped out, that was fun, I got to hear all how I'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

I ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. And blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

I don't know wtf I'm going to do about them. They did threaten to stop paying for my college if I cut them out of my life. I unblocked them to say I want to be in touch with them and do love them but I can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. I said if they stop doing that then I'm happy to have a relationship with them. They had a million reasons why I'm in the wrong. I couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. So I don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

My boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. He thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. He's really helped keep me as sane as I can be. 

Overall I just feel really shitty. I wish any of them would ever listen to what I say. But if they won't then what can I do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. It just sucks it has to be so...final, I guess. I wouldn't mind a middle ground like PLANNING a visit with them ONCE IN A WHILE, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than I do. 

TL;DR: I'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I think my (22M) girlfriend (20F) might be cheating on me with my roommate.,"Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/aj79wj/i\_think\_my\_22m\_girlfriend\_20f\_might\_be\_cheating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aj79wj/i_think_my_22m_girlfriend_20f_might_be_cheating/)

TLDR: My girlfriend was really close with my roommate, I suspected cheating, was confirmed at a party when she made a scene about her friend kissing said roommate.

Basically, after I kicked my gf out of our party, I assumed we would all lay low for a few days. I was wrong. The day after the party, my roommate (I decided to call him Chet) knocked on my door and tried to talk, but I ignored him. Less than an hour later the (ex) girlfriend sends me a long text, at first apologizing, then explaining that her screwing Chet couldn't have been avoided, because while I was a good boyfriend, I study and sleep too much. Ok. She then told me she would be willing to work through this if I was willing to try to be better and pay more attention to her. I didn't respond to the text.

That night I had a dinner with my parents I couldn't miss, that the ex knew about. I came home to find all of her stuff taken out of my room. I figured ok, she got the hint and moved her stuff back to her dorm. Wrong. I noticed later when Chet's door was open she had actually moved her stuff into HIS room.

I haven't seen either of them, I think they've been out of the apartment to avoid me. I don't even know how to feel. Honestly the breakup is so raw (even though we haven't even really had the chance to break up) and I'm so angry at both of them, but strangely miss them at the same time. ",relationship_advice
