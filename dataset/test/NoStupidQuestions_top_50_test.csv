"does anyone else stay up at night because they feel if they go to sleep then they havent gotten enough free time at home?. i'm a high school student, just a freshman, and sometimes i feel that if i go to sleep early then i'll just be like ""well, this day just felt like school, barely any time at home."" sometimes i just stay up so i actually feel more at home and not always have that feeling of just school, school, school. does anyone else feel this way, maybe with work as well?  

edit: i know people don't like it when others edit their message saying ""thank you"" or anything, but dang did i not expect this post to be the highest post in the sub after i, ironically, came home from school. thank you all!  

it is interesting to see a lot more people than i thought stay up for free time as well. i can't imagine going to school or going to work, then going to sleep only a couple or few hours later, only to do the same thing again the next day.",7

"how do you repair relations with crows?. story is relevant.

my neighbourhood has a lot of crows. over twenty of them. they are generally on good terms with one another.

i watched them band together and kill one of the crows. they left its dead body in my yard. i waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because i don't want crow guts everywhere.

however, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. this brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. none of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time i am outside. some swoop. they are becoming more and more aggressive.

confusion on why they'd be mad at me for cleaning up _their_ mess aside, how do i repair relations with these crows? i don't want to deal with being attacked every single day by multiple crows. 

google is not helpful on this front at all. there is surprisingly little documentation on how to make crows like you after you've cleaned up the corpse of one of their peers.


is it as simple as feeding them every day? something else? am i doomed?",7

"my brother died in a power line accident, did it hurt?. my brother died in a work accident. his drilling rig hit a 12,250-volt overhead power line.

anyway, would it hurt to die that way? 

he was working the controls, standing on the back of the truck when the arm of the drill hit the power line. witnesses saw the truck burst in flames, and the fire department wasn't able to make it to the truck for over an hour. 

i wanted to know if it was instant? would it hurt? did he burn alive? 

i told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn't even know what happened, but reading online i don't know if that's true. 

i'm crying right now, it just sucks and i miss him terribly. 

edit: for those asking, this accident happened last may. the emotions are raw and fresh again because easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.

i had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

with it coming up again, i just keep thinking why did i cancel? we could have had one last day with him but we didn't. i want to go up this year, in his memory but i don't know if i can. 

edit 2: thank you everyone for the kind words and thoughts and answers. 

i didn't think i'd get this many responses, i honestly just randomly wrote this question trying to help myself with the new grief and pain i was feeling in the moment. 

truly, thank you everyone for taking the time to answer and respond.

"matched with girl on tinder. profile said 18, got phone number, she calls and reveals she's 10.. i blocked her and the texts were super short and completely non sexual. she randomly calls me and i was like shit she sounds super young. i text her and ask if she's 18. she said yes. later she texts me and said she was lying. she facetimes me and she's in fucking kid pajamas and says she's 10 and calls me stupid. 

this is dangerous. what can i do to notify her parents ?  it is an att number. should i call them? 



edit : i looked up the number on social media. nothing. i reported it to tinder using their online form. 

she used fake pictures of course. i could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. i will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. i reported it to tinder and that's all i will do. some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. the second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) i hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. she revealed she was 10 while i was in the process of blocking the number. 

even before she said she was under 18 i said absolutely zero things that wouldn't be okay to say to a ten year old, so i know i'm in the clear. i believe there's zero case to be made for any sort of enticing or anything like that. ",7

"am i a loser for being a virgin at 27 years old?. i was born in vietnam and moved to the us when i was 23. i had some girls interested in me during college (in vietnam) but we never made a move because you know, it's vietnam and it's the cultural thing back then. then i moved to the us. haven't found anyone since. there's so few asian in my city let alone vietnamese. my college is full of white and latins (demographics). don't get me wrong i don't mind dating out of my race but college folks here seem to keep to themselves, even men. i made some friends but as soon as semester ends they all go their own path. some even deleted my number and ignored me. and it seems like all women are taken. in the end maybe it's because i'm not good looking (short, dark skin, average looking face). i also have moderate depression & anxiety. 


then people made fun of me when they knew i'm a virgin. even my relatives laughed behind my back too.

i made a post in a tech subreddit. not only people didn't answer my question, but also they stalked my profile and made fun of me being a virgin. 

i know it might not be a big deal. but i felt so down after that. i felt like i should commit a suicide for being a useless loser in this world... 

do i have hobbies? yes, but most of them don't involve interactions with people. i keep a big fish tank and i love them. i play video games too. i've been rescuing stray dogs since i moved here. i used to volunteer at my local shelter but since i adopted my dog here and got busy with school i volunteer much less nowadays...

also, i know rule 5 says no medical advice, but this seems less than ""how do i treat \_\_\_\_ disease"" and more of ""everyone does this and i don't what should i do?"" i'm going to get vaccinated but it's more of a matter of where do i go to get vaccines.
