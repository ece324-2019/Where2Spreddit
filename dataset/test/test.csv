"meta: this sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world. i've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and i feel like i've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. over time, more and more of the posts seem to have a- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and b- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

given that, i think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

so just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

they'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. they'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

the internet has its own values, and that's fine. but in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? people who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? people who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? the people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

so yeah. i love this sub, i love reading the stories and i find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. but i personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people i know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. i don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

so even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. and maybe this is just me, but i really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. that's a discussion worth having too.

edit: thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. and lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

edit 2: wow, this got very big. it's gonna take me a minute to read all this. 

and alright guys, maybe the one about not ever wanting to socialize with coworkers outside of work is more of a thing in my field, not a universal experience. academia blurs the line between personal and professional like nobody's business, so i might have a warped view on this one. 

edit 3: i've never seen this movie, but it's come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent tl,dr: ""you're not wrong walter, you're just an asshole""",3
"update, for despising my mentally handicap sister?. i'm back like i said i would be,. my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

well, since that day i made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. the week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

i started by telling my grandpa the story of why i broke down the way i did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. no one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. my grandpa told me some things that i don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this i was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. with everything else i told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. he pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when i sat down with them. it didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. this included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

suffice to say, this week has been rough. but, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. my grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things i want to do. my aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

well, saturday night i sat down with parents to talk. it went badly to say the least. they came clean to me about everything. they told me things i will not repeat here. but they did not apologize. my parents still claim that i some how owed my sister my time. my father even saying ""you were put here to be her caretaker"". i won't lie and say i was composed. after everything i learned i confronted them. on the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. the money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. they denied it or made excuses. and in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

today will be my last time talking to them for a while. after talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, i'm not going back. later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. when i graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. my aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. my parents have called me twice since saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when i was coming home.

i won't be going back to them. right now i still feel pretty uneasy about everything but i feel like that will pass. the rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. but in the end i lost my parents. over all of this, i've learned something that i wished i saw earlier. i don't hat my sister. in fact i love her with all my heart. i should never have never projected my hate onto her. that was wrong, and someday i hope to make up for it. but for now i need to leave.

so, there's my update. thanks again for the support my original post got. i really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. thanks you.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all so much! i wish i could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. i'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. i want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.

&#x200b;

late edit: wow, i never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. i know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. 

&#x200b;

we just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. every thing i wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. i have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record i could think of. my parents were quiet the whole time i was there. shorty after i arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. it took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. i hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. even now i sit here and think if she really meant it. after this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. i hope she meant it. right now though, i think i just need to look ahead. maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. i hope so.

&#x200b;

thank you all for the advice and love. it's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience i at least got some positive out of this mess. will i come back? i don't know. if something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. but for now i'm going to move on. for all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and i hope to see you on the other side. see you space cowboy's :)",3
"update: for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that i helped get addicted to drugs?. i want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. everyone's comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. 

since i received such great advice on my original post, i felt like i had an obligation to update. and i'm trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. 

the funeral service was held this past thursday. before then, i brought all the advice i received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how i was feeling and what i should do. 

my sponsor was straight with me and told me that i would be putting myself in danger by going and that i should do something else that day to grieve. 

when thursday rolled around, i was a mess. i seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead i grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. 

we went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. 

i'm doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. 

i haven't reached out to any of marcy's family and i don't plan to. i understand now how devastating that would be. 

that's it. take care everyone.",3
"meta: too many commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth.. i've become frustrated with how quick a lot of commenters are to encourage op's to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. while leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

when we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for love, empathy, understanding, and communication. these capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our ""throw-away"" consumer society. i often get a feeling that many commenters don't have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. ",3
"for making a dad joke?. note. my step-daughter, madeline, was about a year old when i married her mother, jessica. madeline's father died before she was born. 
 
madeline is currently 15, and she's rebelling for almost everything. she did something bad, so while picking her up, i set a punishment up for her. then she said ""you're not my dad. i don't have to follow you"". honestly, i got a bit hurt from that. but i understand that she didn't mean it, and that she'd probably change. i just replied ""i'm still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules."" 
 
that happened about 2 days ago. so our family was going grocery shopping, when madeline said ""i'm hungry. i need food."" i decide to be extremely cheeky and say ""hi hungry, i'm not your dad."" my son just started to laugh uncontrollably. my daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. and my wife was berating me ""not to stoop down to her level."" 
 
i honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. and my son agrees. so aita?
 
edit: i did adopt her. so legally i am her parent.

 
mini update: i'll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. i go to my daughter's room after dinner and begin talking with her. ""hey. i'm really sorry that i hurt you by the words i said. and i am really your dad. i changed your diapers, i met your boyfriend, and i plan on helping you through college. and plus i'm legally your dad, so we're stuck together. but seriously, i'm going to love you like my daughter even if you don't think i'm your dad. then i hugged her. she did start to cry. i assume that's good.",3
"for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?. we had a family dinner this evening. my family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29f), younger sister (24f) and youngest brother (22m).

extended family attended our family dinner. so all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. during the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. my sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. the two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

eventually my sister got really fed up and said ""shut up, i'm not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin."" my brother hadn't done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. i think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

anyway, i immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. she replied by saying everyone knows he's a virgin and she didn't say anything wrong. this annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn't need to be made fun of like this.

so i responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it's not a big deal right? turns out her husband didn't know this amazingly, i genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

family is blaming me for their marital problems. i refuse to accept i did anything wrong. my sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all i did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",3
"for suggesting my 7yo name his new stuffed tiger ""tig bitties""?. pretty much the title. my son won a stuffed tiger at the fair last night and said he had named him ""tig"". he asked me what its last name should be. i couldn't help myself and just instantly replied ""bitties"". then i turned to my wife to share a smirk, but she was pissed and quickly suggested a few different last names, but my son insisted that he liked ""bitties"", so now his tiger is tig bitties. my wife thinks it was completely inappropriate, i think it was a silly joke that went over his head and will have no negative ramifications.",3
"aita for wearing the ""joke"" bikini my friend got me?. so it was my birthday couple months ago. had a party. got some gifts. my friend ""mandy"" for me a ""super cute bikini"". i liked it. said thanks. she had ripped the tags off but whatever. 

anyway. went to the community pool with my roommate. wore bikini. got in the water. roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... i look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. 

haha good joke mandy. 

anyway, mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. most leave and we're still hanging out. i'm like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? i go change after them. and meet her bf in the hot tub she's getting new drinks. i hop in. immediately, he's looking at my chest. i pretend i don't notice and just make small talk. she comes out a few min after. and just looks in shock. eventually gets in. ""uhh is that the one i bought?"" yeah i love it. i wear it everywhere. make up some stuff about how i wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she's just like ""oh"". 

we're in the tub for 20-30. eventually get out and change. she approached me after and was like. ""uhm i'm sorry thought you'd notice. but it goes kinda see thru"". i'm like yeah i know why'd you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? ""she's like it's a joke. wait you knew? so you just spent last 30' flashing my bf on purpose?"" i reply i'm just wearing my birthday gift from her. 


anyway. aita?",3
"for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?. dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but i'm struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

we've always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. this year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and i jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. we learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, i adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

none of this has been a problem for me until recently. she saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then i rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. she exploded in anger (teen years, i'm not too fussed about the anger explosion, i know she doesn't mean it) and said that that was her pan for vegan food. i was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it's not your pan. 

she asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. i didn't want her to feel weird about food, so i said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. the reason they're colored is so it helps me remember that i'm not to touch them unless i'm cooking vegan. 

that wasn't good enough. now apparently the dishwasher is 'contaminated' with animal product, and the fridge has 'bacon grease fingers' on it (because i eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she's asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. i don't mean i literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because i wash my hands, but it's clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly i'm on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. my wife's reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn't want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. my daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it's specifically meat products that make her feel sick. now i'm sorry for her, but i feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because i'm not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",3
"for despising my mentally handicap sister?. the title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200b;

my sister is severely autistic. she requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. she is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200b;

i hate her. that should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200b;

i was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. even since i can remember the world has revolved around her. i was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. all of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when i complained. even when i was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me i was in the wrong.

&#x200b;

along with this i am expected to take care of her and drop everything i do for her. i can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. even when i do somehow get time to myself i am required to leave if they need me. if i do not then i am punished. the recent example of this is when i went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200b;

it seems as if i am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. this last week i was chosen to give a speech at a school event. i was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200b;

i've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. while talking about colleges with my father, he joked that i should get a degree that pays well so when their gone i can take care of my sister. i don't know why but this caused me to break down. i cried and screamed about how it always about her. i'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that i'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&#x200b;

i've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. am i the asshole here?

&#x200b;

edit/update kinda:

wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. i never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. thank you all. after thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that i don't despise my sister. it's not her fault that she was born the way she is. my parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but i was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. they have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. my parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best i leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. thank you all again for the love and support through this <3

"for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?. so my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. she was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. she was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn't lift a finger to go visit her. 

i tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. he said no. and my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. i spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he'd have to fly over to her country too. which is fair enough. 

he said no, he didn't want to fly or travel anywhere. my son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

last week, he told us she's dumped him. i went on her fb page as we're all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she's upset it didn't work out but these things happen, so we're on good terms) and looks like she's with a new guy already. me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

i confessed to them both that i actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. he did not treat her properly and i hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. i said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

wife and son are very upset that i said this. very very upset and my wife says i am being horrible.

"for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?. new to reddit, please bare with. 

so i (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

however, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. she and i have quite a lot in common, and i actually like spending time with her. however it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; i'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. however, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if i want coffee. i sleep naked. every time prior to the last one, i've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. i always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but i didn't"". 

when she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, i intentionally slept on top of the covers. sure enough, she barges in at 7am, begins to ask if i want coffee and sees my you-know-what. she immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. my mate later pulled me aside and said i was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that i'd ""threatened"" to do it before (i literally just said ""okay but what if i had no covers and you saw everything"" before). they're now framing this to others that i'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how i get my rocks off, and i'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. for doing this?",3
"for giving my ex wife a large amount of money i won despite the anger of my gf?. i recently won a 'fuck you' amount of money. i won't say exactly how much but it's in the millions. it makes me feel funny even typing it's enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

my ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. she is an amazing woman and good to the bone. we divorced 6 years ago because i had an affair with my current partner. i was in a low place in my life and i fucked up. she was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that i know she was hurting. she still is close with my parents. she is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

she was actually the first person i phoned after my mom and pops after i found out i won the lottery. she was pleased for me, joked that i could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. nothing else. as soon as i won, i knew i wanted to give her a significant amount. i still love her. she's the mother of my babies and i feel like this is some small tiny way i can show her that i'm not a complete fuck up. she deserves to know that i care despite my mistakes. she also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. give our kids a better life between us. i haven't discussed this with my ex yet, but i have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

long story short, when i told my gf, she was my livid. screaming that i'm disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- i'm not *in* love with her. we've both grown apart, but of course i still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. my gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh i'm feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. i don't plan on changing my plans, but aita?

"for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?. ok this is the worst. i'm losing sleep over this.

i'm getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and i cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

my brother is gay, but my family doesn't know, only me and my parents know. i come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century's mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

so my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, i'm so happy my brother found a great guy. but it's kind of a secret, as he hasn't told my family he is gay.

i've been telling him for years that he should come out, cause i know it stresses him a lot, and i think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus i bet a few family members already know anyway.

but he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won't accept it and it will be a lot of drama. i see the opposite, i see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. i have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn't accept my brother being gay.

anyway, that's his decision not mine, so for now he won't say anything.

until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. i was not expecting that to be honest. so he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

if it was any other occasion i would be supportive obviously, but i don't think my wedding day is the day to do that.  imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. and i don't want to get the attention away from my fiancee, that's her day. and i dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and i think it's a pretty good reason

i asked him why my wedding day, he said it's because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. this is killing me. i would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if i had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and i can't do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

i didn't even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

with a heavy heart, i asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that i hope he understands me. he  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

next day i got a text and he said "" dont worry, going alone"". i tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don't seem to know what's happening because they didn't say anything.

he eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

this is the worst situation of my life, am i the asshole for handling it the way i did?

ps 1: i wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

ps 2: thanks for the gold and stuff!

update: spoke to fiancee, couldn't keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

clarification: i know it won't be my brother that would cause trouble. the trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. doesn't matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.i don't want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. literally every other day of my life i will support my brother's decision to come out. even at the wedding, i would obviously defend him. but the point is, not at the wedding. also, my brother is not the asshole. not at all.",3

> unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. however, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to google).**

> we don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. however, we know it was much shorter. i think it was somewhere around half?

> this shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback).

# original thread info

hey all you assholes and judges. we recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. a huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. take a look here(https://m.imgur.com/a/vzvv1ag). 

we think that's a problem. a comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. we want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. so, we've decided to fuck with the sub.

# introducing ~~30-minute~~ 60-minute contest mode

for the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **contest mode.** the comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. you will not be able to see the karma score of comments. after 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. the comment order will be ""best"" instead. 

**why did we do this?** the first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. by opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. no one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. we tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). it didn't work out well. a 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",3
"for keeping my website up after being asked to remove it?. **updated 7:50 pm:** holy crap! thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. i never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! i had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when i checked back in after work. several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.

&#x200b;

my intent was to answer more questions since i wasn't able to do that while at work. i was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however i've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what i have already posted if i wish to pursue a civil suit.

&#x200b;

just a couple things i want to address in my update here. some people are saying i'm leaving out details. my original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. i had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so i apologize if it looks like details have been left out. i did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. lastly, my son is now back with me. there was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.

&#x200b;

i'm sorry if i didn't respond to your comment or private message. i'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. i can't even begin to put into words how grateful i am. again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.

back in november 2018 i was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. it was the most humiliating thing i've ever experienced. i later learned at the police station that i was being charged with multiple felonies. this came as a huge surprise. luckily i was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. for $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, i was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. however it cost me everything and i was unable to pay my bond. this resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. at a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and i ended up having all my charges dismissed. when i finally got out i learned that i had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. his mother is a heroine addict and i haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. they wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200b;

since my release, i've learned that i can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that i was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. i've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. they took down my info but never followed up. so what i did was create a website sharing my story. i also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. literally the only reason why i was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. if the detective had done his job, he could have verified that i wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. this is what pisses me off the most. my life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200b;

i'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. i live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. my web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. i received a cease and desist letter recently, which i showed to my attorney. he said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything i had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. yesterday i received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. he apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" they then talked to me about my website and asked if i could remove it. i said i would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200b;

after the visit i received, i'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. i don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. my friends think i'm being spiteful and have suggested that i just delete it. for keeping my website up?

"for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?. **edit: the boyfriend doesnt live with us and doesnt pay rent or bills. him and his daughtes spend time here and pay only for their food: something i do as well*** 

my dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she's started seeing. i'm 23m and going into my final year of college. my moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. my mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone's favourite uncle. and while i'm glad everyone else is comfortable, i'm not. 

he isn't a bad guy, i'm just still grieving my father, and it feels like he's trying to replace him. he tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn't because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. boyfriend thinks it's only fair because i have siblings now. i think it's ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

he's trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. they aren't lacking for anything but he thinks it's only fair because ~family~. 

i live in the basement of my moms house. i have since i was 15. when you come in the front door there's a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. so it's pretty separate. 

so last night i was dding for some friends and got home at 2 am. i had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren't until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. so this has never been a big deal with my parents. i shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. i got a lecture and sent to my room and ""possible loss of car privileges.""

i snapped and laid it out for him. i told him i'm leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i'm glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. i told him our relationship won't be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won't want to have a relationship with him. 

he told my family and they think i'm the asshole. aita?",3
"update: for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last?. this is the original post: /r/amitheasshole/comments/dcvwmo/aita_for_continuing_to_call_my_teacher_by_her/

i first want to thank everybody who commented on my post. it honestly helped me so much and without it i don't know if i'd end up in this position.

so i went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. they of course said no. i'm kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he'd come to me if it meant so much. however he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn't work he'd definitely accompany me to the principals office.

so i went to my teacher. i already knew how everything was going to go out so i didn't have any hope. i told her that i don't appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues i would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the mrs.). she told me that i was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. i told her that many people don't think she's fair and in return she just looked confused. i handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she's my english teacher). her face went from nothing to just sadness. i swear it was so weird. it's like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.

she apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. and saying my name just gets her bad memories i guess? she told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. at this point i kinda felt guilty because i never took this thought into consideration.

she told me she'd try to say my name ( and won't cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime i can still call her by her first name. ( all my classmates are jealous because i'm the only person allowed lol)

we've talked about the past detentions she's given me and she said she'll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.

honestly this isn't how i thought things were going to turn out. and i'm pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",3
"for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?. i (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. my boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. he gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. i'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

however, there's one girl in our class, let's call her victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. she goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. i know this is the case, because i've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

i've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and i don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. however, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. i rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. she was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him i was there too.

victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. i snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. you're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

she looked super embarrassed and walked away, and i later heard she'd gone home crying. i feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. aita?

edit: she 100% knows that i am his girlfriend, i have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",3
"for telling cashier that wasn't the girls credit card?. 
throwaway because husband told me i was ta and want to know before i get home and argue. on phone format is bad.

i was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. one of the girls had picked out a pair of very expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she's really gonna spend that much on boots. girl with boots says something along the lines of ""it's fine i have my dads credit card i'm not paying "" which instantly caught my attention because thats not her card. i've told my son multiple times he's never allowed to use my card so i'm interested to see how this girl thinks she's going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

we end up at the same register (me behind) and i see her total hit well over four digits. the girl is about to swipe her card when i decide that i can't let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. i tell cashier that isn't her card but her father's and i'm not sure she has permission. girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look i've ever seen. i swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, i don't think she was ever told no.

girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it's the stores credit card and it gives him the points. now that i've pointed out it wasn't hers cashier tells her she can't use that card. girl tries to show id to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and i tell her it's still fraud. girl says it's not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. i tell her that it is my business that she's doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or i call the cops. girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. she uses her own card and leaves crying. cashier looks mad at me and i tell my husband when i get home only for him to agree i was in the wrong.

"for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?. i am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. both of them had spouses at the time. my birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when i was conceived so there was no way i was his. a few months after i was born they decided not to divorce. i was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that i am adopted by my grandparents. recently i decided that i wanted to know more about my dad's family and i sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so i could get to know him. well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over skype. they both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

well i did pretty much the opposite. i contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. she is now divorcing him while on my mother's side i told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother.

we called him into a meeting on friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. i thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

"hey assholes, you're doing it wrong.. since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time i ranted about voting on this sub. so, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: welcome to the sub! second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.

you may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:

* **upvote real dilemmas**. if you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the op is an asshole or not, **upvote it**, because that's an interesting post!!
* **upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. if you see a post where you think the op is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **upvote it** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!
* **stop rewarding validation posts**. upvotes are not a political statement. they aren't something you give because the op is really nice. every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the op is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the op, they're ruining the sub. if you want to tell op they're great, write an nta comment and praise them all you want. don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.

as you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. what makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. this is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. please be the better person and vote correctly here. interesting content depends on it!  (if you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)

also important: in the comments, show a little backbone. **don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** if you say the post is nta, and someone else says it's esh, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. if you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. there are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. the whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. if you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and gtfo. you have come to the wrong place.

p.s. if you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. maybe you're not an asshole after all.  


edit:  i see a lot of people in this discussion suggesting rules we already have in place.  i suggest you read the full rule book and the faq if you think you've got a new idea.

"for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?. background: i graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. my sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. we both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. i pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

this is a throwaway and it's still fresh and i'm really emotionally charged right now. last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. i overheard and i offered to help by paying more in rent (i was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. my parents were grateful. now, prior to this, i never asked my how much sister pays in rent. i always figured my parents charged us the same. so absentmindedly i asked a follow-up question.

me: how much is my sister paying for rent?

my mom: nothing.

a long ass pause.

me: what do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

my dad (visibly angry): your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

my dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. she doesn't pay rent. she doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. so for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while i've been paying my parents.

so later that night we had a family sit down talk. my sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much i was paying. she offered $100. my parents suggested she pay $300, i pay $800 which my sister and i both rejected.

the conversation ended with this:

sister: **fuck you. i'm trying to live my life.** these were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

so my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. i'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. my mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

so i say my part before leaving.

me: i'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (it's only fair right?) and if i do pay rent, i pay whatever she's being.

my mom: what if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

me: no.

my mom: but me, we really need the money...

me: that's too bad.

i get up and go off to my room.

so this morning my dad comes in tells me that i'm an asshole for not paying rent. that i should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. i'm like, ""what the hell? make my sister pay rent!""

my mom, who's listening in.

""you've seen her! she won't listen to us!""

me: well that's too bad.

my mom (really angry): well we wouldn't have this problem if you didn't try to make your sister pay rent.

that was the last straw that blew it for me. i slammed the door on my parents.

as i'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. like wtf?",3
"for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it?. i fucking hate wedding culture.

it's bullshit.

my fiance and i thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. we were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

then the demands started coming out. they wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person has to be a groomsman, etc etc. suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

we put our foot down and said:

>thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. when we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. with so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   
>  
>our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  
>  
>if you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. but if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.

this has caused an epic shitstorm. such to the point where i have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. my parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. 

we are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want.

"if i ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?. my wife is pregnant with our daughter. initially we were really happy and excited about it. but then, she starts acting like a nut job. she gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food i make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

for example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. well, i made chicken sandwiches. so she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. i wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. but if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? when i asked her this she told me that she was hungry. ok fine. she does this every time. eats everything i make and calls it shit. i don't argue with her because i work for more than 80 hours a week and i really want to have some peace when i'm home.

so, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if i wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. i rejected her and told her that i was married. and when i got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. when i asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. so they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. and i passed. yay!!. i'm really pissed. i'm done with her antics. if i ask her to move out?

"for purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?. this issue is honestly making me frustrated. almost everyone is saying i am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and i genuinely don't know if what i did was correct or not. i just feel so lost. please, please do help.

i am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when i was 13. i have 2 really deep,long facial scars. i have been bullied really bad because of it. i am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. people make fun of other people by saying things like ""why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" i am honestly used to it. those people didn't matter to me anyway.

but there is this girl i had known since middle school. let's call her back i guess? sorry, i honestly don't know how this works. i had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. i thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. my family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. i can play a guitar so i made this whole song for her. i went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. this was the first time i felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and i felt that regardless of what i do, she shall see me for who i am and at least accept me as a friend.

i was over the moon when she ended up accepting. we went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. she was really sweet to me. the next week or so was honestly heaven. people started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, i honestly cried everyday because i felt so fortunate to get so much love.
it all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on instagram and followed beck, sent screenshots to me. i honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

she had posts saying 'fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his valentine's"", 'making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of march, and then distance themselves from me. she apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.and thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since i was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

i was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. my blood was boiling. i researched about this award, found a facebook page about it online.i went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

she is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. i am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly i have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


edit: i am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. each comment means the world to me. i am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. no one besides my family has said these things to me. i know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. from the bottom of my heart,thank you.

edit 2: honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. i promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. thank you for the gold.thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. i honestly have gone through as many as i can and i just feel really fortunate and grateful.

i sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

edit 3: i am sorry for boring you with all these edits. i geniunely can't thank you guys enough. i showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. i am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

but, i have been noticing a worrying number of dms saying me i could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

i am not this kind of person and i hope nobody is. i have my own integrity. it's not right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. a couple of other dms sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. it's honestly horrifying. i am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. i just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

i thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. a lot of women are amazing. my mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and i am sure many women out there are amazing.  please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. because i am not going to do that, ever. please don't say all women are manipulative etc. 

this post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person i believe wronged me.",3
"because i refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she's very sick? i low key hate her.. i'm 15 years old. i have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. i'm not sure what's wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she's non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. she also doesn't understand stuff. that's probably the easiest way to put it. she's just a human body with nothing inside. 

she's my stepmoms daughter. my stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. i don't know my stepmom very well and i don't really get on with her. we are respectful to each other but i'm basically living with strangers because she's so busy with her daughter and my dad. i am always on my own and i used to hate it but i'm used to it now.

ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. that's fine, i get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that i don't want to do and i resent doing. stuff like staying home when i want to go to the mall with my friends, they're disappointed that i don't get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

my own mom passed away when i was small so i can't go and stay anywhere else and all in all i'm just a lot more angry than i used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever i say i don't want to do anything for her. even stuff like feeding her- like- i don't want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. i didn't ask for this. 

anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. she was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. i don't want to go and visit her. i remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and i just hate hospitals and i sort of hate my stepsister and i just don't want to go and visit someone who doesn't even know i'm there. 

my stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. they haven't yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because i don't want to visit. my grandma who lives in canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and i don't need to force myself to go to the hospital so i'm assuming my dad has told her i'm refusing to go. he keeps pleading with me but i keep telling him i'm not doing it. i told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and i need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. 

i just want to know what reddit thinks because half my friends think i should go and the other half think i'm justified in saying no.",3

"for calling my co-worker ""chunky"" after she repeatedly calls me ""slim"" and makes references to my weight after i asked her multiple times not to.. i have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. i'm female 5'9"" 115lbs and very thin. she is very overweight. all the time she makes comments about my weight. she doesn't call me by name she calls me ""slim"" and i even heard her say one time ""go ask toothpick"" and she has said stuff like ""you need some meat on your bones"" & ""you need to eat"". i have only worked there 8 days. i have asked her very nicely to stop. yesterday i asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. 

today when she said ""morning slim"" i replied ""morning chunky"" and she got upset and actually started crying. everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying i'm wrong and i should apologize because being called fat is ""different"" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a ""compliment"". i said as long as she calls me slim, i will call her chunky and now i'm the bad person. if i don't apologize? the owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's ""a high school issue and we should figure it out"".

edit for more info: we don't have hr. there's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). we are all regular employees. i went to the owner before i called her chunky and i asked him to talk to her because i felt she was harassing me. that's when he said we can handle it ourselves. that's why i called her chunky. i told her to stop calling me slim and i didn't like it and she continued to do it. she didn't stop doing it after i asked multiple times and i didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. she brought up my weight, i brought up her's.",3

"for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?. i have 3 kids, 15f, 12f and 7m. my oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because i am too. recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. it was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

after the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. there was a fair bit of wine involved (i was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my fil let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate i still cuddled with my 15yo. i don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but i was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. to my surprise, my wife and mil both agreed with him.

i have a lot of respect for my in-laws, i get along with them great and i consider them closer than my own parents. obviously i'm quite fond of my wife as well, but i outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. i've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. they all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. aita?

"for not telling my wife that i picked her daughter up drunk from a house party?. i'm going to try to keep this short and simple. i always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they need to get out of, just call me and i'll drop whatever i'm doing and i will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. i let them know that i used to be a teenager once before, i told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. we're only human and it's a part of life.

last weekend i got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. she was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.

i got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. i had to pick her up and carry her to the car. i told her i was disappointed that she snuck out, but i also told her i was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

"for pointing out to my friends that they are not famous?. my friends are dating, they're also actors who have had small roles on a few tv shows (i'm talking two lines or less). i say this not to be a hater, i truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they've got under 1500 followers combined). 

anyway last week i posted a group picture on instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other's shoulders. very platonic. 

anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don't want ""the public"" to know they are dating. i would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don't. also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. 

anyway i asked what they meant, and they said they didn't want to end up in gossip rags....

i pointed out that they are not famous and that they don't even have functioning imdb pages. they were livid and called me a bunch of names. 

i think they're delusional but they've been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). at this point, i don't even want to be their friend. however, and probably because i'm an asshole, i don't want to delete it based solely on principle.

"for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?. hi all. 

i gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter charlotte. 

my cousin alice and her parents were among the guests. the first thing i'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. she's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. she doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. she is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

it was alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly charlotte vomited on her. alice handed charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. i went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. my mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

today i got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

i have said no. at the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. she took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. i feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

"update: for shutting down all black names because i think it'll make my son's life harder?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/

i posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and i were having with our baby's name. we had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. my husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black american culture. i wanted a more neutral name since i am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. we found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. his name will be....

miles trayvon

we thought it was a perfect compromise. my husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be ""tray"" to most of them. when he's in school his name will just be listed as miles (last name). he can officially be miles t. (last name) if he doesn't want to use trayvon but he can also easily go by trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. this option gives him the choice, which my husband and i agreed was important. my husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. he talked about how in 8 mile eminem's character says something like, ""this guy's a gangsta? his real name is clarence."" that's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. he's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.

i had the opposite experience. my mom is white and my dad is black. they decided on a stereotypical black name and i think it made my life harder. professional i go by a nickname and i do personally as well. when talking about it with my husband i realized it started early. i remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. a woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma i was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. instead of saying my real name my grandma said, ""her name is daisy."" i attended an hbcu and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. for example, raquan smith would put ""ray smith"", demarcus jones would put ""marcus jones"", keshawnda nelson would put ""shawna nelson"", etc. they said you had to play within the system and i did that.

anyway, sorry for the long update. i just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. we didn't really get deep into it until after i posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. before anyone says it, i do realize some people will connect trayvon to trayvon martin. that's not why we are using it. i posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but i don't mean to offend anyone. it's a family name on my husband's side.

edit: thanks for all the dms but please stop sending me articles about the woman named marijuana pepsi and the black spider-man named miles. thanks y'all.",3
"for pretending to be an ""appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me?. i got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

i told them them all that i had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. when i first told them they thought i was joking, but they underestimated how committed i would be to a joke. so, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) i was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

finally after about a week they bought that i had become an appletarian. they started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. some of them even got angry.

but i wanted to stick with the joke. finally, after the end of 3 weeks, i walked into what i was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

they were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. finally i started laughing hysterically. they were confused as hell so i told them i had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. i even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

i thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. my girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago i had ruined our date night when i told the waiter i only wanted apples because i was an appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

in my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

but, did i go too far?

"for ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name?. i've worked at my office for 8 years. i'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. i'm not his supervisor, but i'm definitely a senior employee. i'll call the guy ted faro, because he's a dick.

​

supervisor was going around introducing ted to people, and when he got to me said ""this is john"" and described my job.

​

ted: ""hi, jack.""

me: ""it's john.""

​
ted: ""what?""
​

me: ""my name's john, not jack.""

ted: ""it's close enough for me.""

supervisor: ""his name's john, not jack. let's move on.""

​

this continued for a few months. despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when i wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name jack. i finally told him ""you either use my name, or i ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

his response was ""sure thing, jackie boy.""

​

since i don't work directly with him, i figured ""screw it"" and that i'd ignore him.

​

recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. i work late some nights, and ted came to me and says ""hey, jack, i'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when i get back. see you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

as promised, i ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and i get a call. i recognize his number, so i ignored it. he called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

the first one was along the lines of ""jack i'm at enterprise. come pick me up.""

e-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as jack, jack-o, jackie, and jackie-boy. the emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

i signed out and went home. it was raining hard.

next morning, i saw that ted had sent a few more e-mails. i printed them off. at 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""where the f-bomb were you? i told you when to pick me up! i had to take a cab! do you know how much that cost me?!"" he goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

supervisor: ""ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. he was caught out in the rain.""

​

i relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. i'd highlighted the threats.

supervisor: ""i can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. but it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. that's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""with the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

"update:for objecting to 'girls day'?. hello,

this is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/

this last month has been kind of wild for me so i haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. so the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. due to the fact that i had deactivated my facebook and was only receiving text messages, i didn't realize what was happening before i was ambushed by it. my sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and i confirmed that it was. and she insisted i was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. i responded that i in no way did that as i was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. 

this spread to my family and now the thread was shared on facebook and everyone was shown. i was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where i was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what i did was wrong and demanded an apology. they said that 'i knew' they weren't excluding me and because i gave everyone that impression i owed them an apology. i replied that i absolutely did not know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. i replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-op event, not a girls only event.  they explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether i was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because i'm not a girl. at this point we were going around in circles so i just explained my perspective, i said that i'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it i feel excluded. i explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation i was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. 

at the end of this family meeting, i was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and i was accused of many things that i didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. i told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that i was going no contact for a while. i told them i'm an adult, and i have my own life, and the reason i wanted to be involved was because i didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. if that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but i told them that i was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. my mother/sisters told me that if i was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. at this point, my relationship with my family is over, i left that family meeting and have not reactivated facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. que sera, sera.

she exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, i realized she needed professional help. throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. with an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. she received an aspd diagnosis at 18, and i had suspected it for long prior.

after her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. she's law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. she uses that old dating guide ""the rules"" like a bible. she currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who's crazy about her, and who i have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). he is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

but i doubt she loves him. we've had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she's been open with me that she doesn't feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. when she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt ""pretty neutral"" about the whole thing. she has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she's ever done, and doesn't know what guilt feels like. while she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, i highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she's been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it'll scare him away. i've made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or i will**; to which she always responds, ""i know you wouldn't dare."" i actually would - i really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this ""secret"" from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

i'm not trying to sabotage my daughter's future. **maybe** her boyfriend's love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won't end the relationship. it's his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. someday he's bound to find out she's a bit ""off""; it can't be kept a secret forever. aita?",3
"for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her african american boyfriend to her grandparents?. let me just preface this by saying this: **i have absolutely no problem with interracial relationships.** now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

my daughter (anna) has recently started to date an african american man (jamal). while i'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, i'm happy. the problem is anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. while her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. as i said, i have no problem with mixed relationships and i've set them straight, but i am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

my parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and anna expressed a desire to introduce jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. i told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. i may have no problem with jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. they might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. anna was extremely upset by this and implied i was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

as i said, i know my parents. they simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if anna were to bring jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

anna is currently staying with jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. my wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when i introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend i confided in told me that i have behaved like an ass and that i needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

no advice needed, but i have to know. have i been an ass?",3
"for going to the police over a 'prank'. throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

to preface this, i (24f) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. i have not eaten meat since i was roughly 3-4 years old when i found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). this is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so i thought. 


four nights ago, i was at a party and i will admit, i got white girl wasted. my friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. i checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" to which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). they tasted off to me but i figured it was just because i was drunk. i was wrong. 

i found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends snapchat story. the story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where i asked if it was vegan). the and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when i found out i ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the chickens!!!""). i took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

they all think that i'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so reddit, aita? in my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. in their view, it was just a prank.",3
"for i telling my childhood bully (who is mtf transgender) that she will always be the ""boy who bullied me""?. when i was a in middle school, i was viciously bullied by this boy, who i'll call z. he spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. 

it's been 12 years, and z has since come out as mtf transgender. she messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. we went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. it was along the lines of, ""i'm sorry for being mean. i was young, and i was struggling with my gender identity.""

i thanked her for her apology. when she asked if she was forgiven, and i tried to avoid answering. i am still not over what she did to me. what z did to me impacted me greatly, as i was a impressionable young girl. i struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

z started getting defensive. she told me that i was being petty and that i should forgive her. i told her, ""why? you will always be the boy that bullied me.  an apology won't change that."" she got really offended when i said the word boy, and said that i was misgendering her. she called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out. 

aita?",3
"for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner. ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. she would make noises in between conversations like ""bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. this is especially embarrassing when i am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


i have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. i have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


it was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. we went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""


seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. i rolled my eyes and told her:


""i am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. please excuse me."" 


then i left the restaurant without her. i don't know what occurred to me but i probably shouldn't have done that, but i guess it kinda just snapped. aita?",3
"because i ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?. what i thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and i'm up at 7:05 am dealing with it. i figured while i wait for a text, i could post here to see if what i did was really that bad. 

i'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. i love to eat which probably borders on addiction but i figure since i'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. i have some great friends although there is no doubt i'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. i guess that sets the stage enough. 

last night my friend hosted ufc and i was invited. he got a 6 foot party sub. i also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. well of course people flocked to the food and i had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and i didn't get to have a single one. which is totally fine that's why i brought them but maybe an hour later i was starving. i kept eyeing the sandwich and i'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. i waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). so i was like screw it...i took about half of what was left and ate it. then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

well to be sure as i was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. like i was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. i guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. she was furious and said that i was an incredible pig and that i had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. i felt so bad i tried to explain to her that i really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. i also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

i offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. i said i was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

i woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that i had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that i embarrassed myself last night. i tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

was i the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

edit: i guess i've been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so i can't find out why.

to answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn't a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. this is a local place so it's about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. its still a ton of food don't get me wrong but i can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",3

"super awesome update sat down on my friend's macbook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.. i never thought this would turn out the way it did and i really felt like i learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

i went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and i sincerely thank each and every one of you.

i did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it's around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so i wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, i'm withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. she sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she's going to take me to court.

i got served a few days later and went to court. i told the judge i gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current macbook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (i printed out the email i sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we'll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. i also told him that when i offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no i want the money in cash. when i told her i'd give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. i tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

she gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case i guess. after listening to both of us he ruled that i pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. so i'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

if it weren't for you guys i would've paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and i honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

i feel good for following all the advice here.

"(update) neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/

i'm sad about this update for the kid, i took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because i had questions about an issue i'm having and briefly explained it.

officer shows up, i invite him in and explain the whole situation. he isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. supervisor shows up and i go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where i have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

we watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. a few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what i put on the drive and then signed it, i repeated it all 3 times.

about 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 cps workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. this took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as i remember it and left out anything i wasn't 100% sure on.

the officers and cps workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times i'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

after they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. i'm in my garage so i don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the cps workers van and they left. the father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

i talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

i haven't seen them since the day after the post, i feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (i didn't think it was anything like they found, i just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). i should have called them earlier once the cps reports i was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything.",2
"i think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. he is a doctor.. this is in north texas. 

hey so i must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. i started typing it up in word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. 

i think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. i know this is going to be hard to explain, but i have been having gaps in memory that i have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  i was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then i started to notice that this seems to happen when i go on dates with him. 

i know it must be crazy, but i have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  i know its him as… well i wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

the first time it happened was when we were drinking and i wrote it off as too much to drink. we get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. but then there were a few times when i know we were not drinking. 

i decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. i had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time i talked with him. i remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. my car and his car was in the parking lot too so i was confused. 

i decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

after 3 days at his place i remembered everything so i was started to trust him again. knowing he was an ent i know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. i was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said i should be treating those sores. 

i had completely forgotten they were there. these little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. i got so freaked out he mentioned them that i decided to leave. 

the next day he came over to ""check on me"" and i remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. i never agreed to me with him and would never want to. he does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something i have no memory of. 

i am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

this has started to affect my work life as well as i start to get paranoid when i see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. i get paranoid that they are about to fire me. my friends also state i have been acting strangely and out of character. i have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when i do.  

is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? i do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so i want to be damn sure when i go to the police.

"neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive. male, late 20's, co

i quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (i haven't consumed alcohol in years) and i replaced that habit with drinking martinelli's sparkling apple juice. the juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to corona beer bottles. 
here lies my issue:
this morning i was walking to my car from my apartment and i had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. my neighbors basically jumped me from behind. one grabbed my daughter's car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. he was saying stuff like ""the nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby."" as a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone's screen is destroyed, and i think my nose is fractured. most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that i was not about drink and drive, but that i was drinking apple juice. this all just happened. i'm calling the cops. any suggestions?

btw, i didn't get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. they said they were doing their ""duty"" to protect the community.

update:

the police showed up. as soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports.

"update pa i followed and reported a drunk driver, then i got a ticket for driving past curfew. this is an update to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

i took the advice that i was given and i pled not guilty. last week i went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200b;

i brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that i called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. i also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and i printed out a copy of the ""justification"" law(https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/conscheck.cfm?txttype=htm&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

the hearing started with the officer saying that i was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why i was there, and that i voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. he said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

then it was my turn to speak. i said that while i did drive past curfew, it was because i had noticed an erratic driver and i was following him because i thought he was going to hurt someone. i felt that if i had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. i gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and i said that i would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. i argued that i had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 bac. (the judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the bac.)

finally, i brought up the justification defense. i argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. i said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because i drove in an otherwise safe manner.

the judge agreed and found me not guilty! he said that i had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that i had done the right thing. i'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200b;

tl;dr: went to court. police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" i presented my defense that i was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. judge agreed; i was found not guilty!",2
"i told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.. i got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. i didn't tell him all the details, but i told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and i showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. at first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because i told him i'd run away and call the police if he did.

he called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. they talked to us away from eachother and i had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who i told everything real specific. she was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

we went back home with them and i showed the police where my mother kept drugs that i'm pretty sure we're illegal. she wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and i don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs i think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. i think they're gonna look into it though. 

there were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. like a shelter or something. 

i should of done this year's ago, i feel really bad because i could have had my siblings taken better care of. i don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place i'm in now is way cleaner than i'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. they weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. they also weren't very happy with our house i could tell.

i hope we don't have to go back. and i hope it's ok to post this. even tho i don't need advice anymore. thank you to everyone who helped me.",2

thanks to everyone's terrific advice, i got my university's ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to rainn) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

within a day of meeting with the school's general counsel, my attorney and i were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

one of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration's decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching i am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

between my professors' incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting i was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (i'll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

the ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward.

"update: my father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). my step sisters father, won't allow me visitations... i got custody!!!. **edit: per the bots request, i am required to tell you that i live in washington (wa)**

here's my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

so after one of the most stressful months of my life, i can happily tell you all that i got custody of my step sister.

i did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people i've ever met in my life. i told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

after my step sisters bio dad was informed that i would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. the lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. she said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

after her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, i then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. i've never signed so many things in my entire life. because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, i was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

yesterday, i signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that i had 100% custody of my step sister. after i signed, we both cried and cried for hours. we're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. as i write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

the past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. i consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision i've ever made. these events have made me realise that family isn't just dna based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. i owe all of you for the rest of your lives. once i turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

i hope you all lead wonderful lives. give your loved ones a big hug for me.",2
"my wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! i'm growing very worried. posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

title says it all. we've been married for 3 years now. she's always been one for quirky, ""against-the-grain"" thinking and interests. however, it's not just harmless things like believing there's no gold in ft.knox, taking pictures of trash in ""aesthetic poses"", or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... no, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. but now there's this anti-vax bullshit. 

she got sucked into one of those anti-vax facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she's worked at a fucking wawa for 10 years. she messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on facebook. 

i love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her vitamin k shot, and the hep-b vaccine. however, now she's refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

i know that in her mind, she's coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we've had a number of arguments already. all her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

""oh well if you look this graph you'll see that the numbers of cases for <x disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <y vaccine>""

""i'm the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, i know i'm right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc..."" 

i've tried explaining to her the basic idea of ""correlation doesn't equal causation."" by showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. she followed that one up with ""we aren't talking about ice cream and murder, we're talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! they're completely different!""

i've tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn't as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. she follows that up with ""those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and ""big-pharma""

she won't budge and hasn't budged for weeks now. our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and i'm worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could've been easily avoided. 

i am in florida. is there anyway i can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife's knowledge? what are my options here? legally speaking, what kind of leeway do i have? i don't want this to lead to divorce but i just feel quite lost at the moment. 

edit: thank you to everyone for your advice! i come to the decision that i will try and sit my wife down one last time, as i am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome i desire. if that fails, i have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because i know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child. will keep you updated",2
"update to: someone is threatening to release nude photos of me that were taken when i was underage and i'm terrified that i'll lose my job and be arrested for what is essentially child porn (ohio). original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/

so as the title states, last year i was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when i was 14/15. i thought i would update now that it's come to a resolution.

i went to see a lawyer the day after i made that post. he drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that i had nothing to worry about. it was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. then i got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

i panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. he was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. he was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). i wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that i wasn't really allowed to know about.

anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus i'm getting married in a few months and i'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. so i thought i'd update here with the good news! i was afraid that i'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys i got up the courage to deal with the situation. i really appreciate the advice i got here! thank you again so much.

"i was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the da finally got around to my case. i did nothing wrong.. okay, so a few days ago i was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. i lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

i was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (i'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest i didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something i did not do). i had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where i was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. i'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything i told him to at this appearance i had because a simple background check shows i don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened i was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). he literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

so then i sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. i tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper i had but he was never in and never came to see me. i couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. i don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, i was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because i can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months i'm about to owe.

when he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the da who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter i mailed them until then also. after that appearance i got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and i was released.

what can i do for any of this? apparently someone with the same name but a different dob shot a building after a fight and is a felon but i sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless i pay some crazy fees (how am i liable for these fees if it was a error?!). this is in madison, wisconsin

edit: thanks for all the replies guys and gals, i'll contact the wisconsin branch of the aclu tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. also i appreciate the messages offering to help me if i need it but i can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.

edit 2: to clear up more confusion about my car. the city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. the storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and i only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. the towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and i can get my car but told ""good luck"". also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.",2

"subaru service center gave my car to someone else. final update

so i dropped my subaru wrx off to be serviced at a third party service center.  they called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when i arrived today i waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  they offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  should i take any action against them/is there any action i can take against them. 

<edit: i need to clarify a mistake i made earlier when posting this, they are not an official subaru service center as i previously thought.  they are just a third party service center, i have and do not want any hate going out towards subaru, they did nothing.  this was not their fault and i love their cars/company.  i will be posting a final update later tonight about how everything is ending.  thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

edit:

thank you all for all of the advice.  im not good with legal stuff and if i had not posted here i probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  i called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while i called the cops.  i still have not seen it but i was told the damage was extensive and that i would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  at this point im going to get a lawyer involved right? i shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  even if they offer to cover fixing it im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  they if i didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but im really not having that.  not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

final update:
hey guys i just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  i did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  little backstory, when i first bought the car in november the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  that is what i was getting fixed.  that being said, in the end i will be getting a new 2019 wrx, i am pressing charges against the sm for theft, i have filed official complaints with the motor vehicle dealer board and the office of the attorney general consumer protection section, and i will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  luckily my lawyer was pro bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  all in all i am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  without this thread i would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  for everyone dm'ing me and asking about what the location is, i am not at liberty now nor will i be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  it is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  thanks again everyone!

my location is washington dc

"update, my son took the boba fett figure.. so, i never honestly expected the post i made to get where it did. i also never expected the barrage of support and hate. i will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.

&#x200b;

so, why am i back? well, because i feel like i need to be. i'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how i acted or seek validation. i'm here because i feel that for myself i need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.

&#x200b;

so, i want to talk about something first before i get into the update. many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how i reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. i was also hit pretty hard for how i was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. to give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. we have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. we're just to different in some senses. he's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. in these past few years we've tried to fix this. work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. during our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and i wont lie i never understood the appeal. it is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200b;

so, when my son stole and damaged his property i didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. so when he asked for 2,000 to fix it i really didn't feel like it was worth it. was this wrong of me? maybe. i don't feel bad about defending my son, i only feel bad that i discounted my brother in the process.

&#x200b;

sorry about that. like i said, i don't want sympathy. i only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

so, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. i had no idea what i was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. we collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. during this time i got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. i offered to pay in full.

(also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so i asked him. he had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

my brother said he plans to not sue us. his renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. at first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. this was the plan until last night.

during the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. it turns out my son stole the figure to sell. he had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. he didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

suffice to say, i am not happy about this. i won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. my brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly i think this might be for the best in the end. the way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and i believe the only option that i can live with myself making is this. i will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

so, thank you all for the advice. the support and hate are what i needed as a true wake up call. like i said, i don't need pity. i'm doing this so that i can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.",2
"my daughter disowned my underage grandson. what do i do?. i posted in r/justnofamily and was told to post here for better advice on what to do in this situation. 


my sixteen-year-old grandson was kicked out by his mother because he came out of the closet. he travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. i found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first i'm hearing about it. 


i phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. she said some very nasty things. i honestly thought i raised her better than to act in such a manner. but my grandson doesn't want to go back home, i'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but i want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible.

"co my ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. she now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. i want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible.. me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. there were a variety of reasons for this that i wont get into here. one of them though was her anti-science beliefs. she's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200b;

we have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. my ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. and threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200b;

around this time i also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. when this happened i decided i wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. the only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. my ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. the judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200b;

ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" i demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. so, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. she somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. i have been stressed out from the minute i got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. my daughter must have picked up on this and thought i was mad at her because when i was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200b;

turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. she made my daughter lie about it. instead she has been using ""special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" what about the forms i got saying she was vaccinate? there fake. i called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. so my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200b;

i'm pissed to say the least. my daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. my ex doesn't know i know yet and i told my daughter not to tell her, i want her gone now. how do i approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. i have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. i also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones i have a forged. i'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but i would like to know going in what to do. thank you.",2
"little sister (16) needs an abortion. texas wants parental consent which we can't get. can i take her to new mexico? (update: it's done). https://redd.it/6m79kf

so it is done. we called an abortion clinic in new mexico and asked for advice. they were very helpful. scheduled an appointment.

i told my parents that i'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in new mexico for 2 days. they never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. so in the morning i picked her up and we drove to new mexico. we took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. she spent the day and that night at my place. i called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so i'll bring her there tomorrow.

she was feeling fine by then. so nothing suspicious at all. she's very happy this worked out the way it did and i'm happy that she's happy. i told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. you can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. once we knew i won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. ",2
"update mn school is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. i'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.. i'm updating my last post(https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

i did what you all told me to do. i wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. i also called them. they said they will speak with the school.

i was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. i did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

i said loudly ""i think you owe me an apology.""

she said ""yes, i should not have accused you of cheating.""

i said ""yes, and another apology for saying i don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

she said ""i'm sorry"" and left.

the principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

i said ""it wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

he apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. i then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

so things are sorted out now. but also, i'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. i only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and i was very pissed off at them. and the counselor had given me horrible advice.

thanks for pointing me in the right direction!",2
"update - my brother went missing 6 years ago. police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? how do we get more information. illinois.. https://redd.it/74we5z

i talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. they found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. the officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

there days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed dna samples to confirm. dna confirmed it was him.

what happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). that was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. that's when they decided to... his friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

the officer says my brother didn't die in pain. it was multiple gunshots. you'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. we had a funeral for him. now there's a place that i can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

i thank all of you who helped.

"update had a falling out with the girl i love and got served a cease and desist order. what can i legally do? michigan (x-post on r/relationships). past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

oh boy. i've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. i wasn't going to, but i know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and i actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and i read all the comments there. it was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. i decided i needed to post again for some closure. i would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

for those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so i'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. i want to take full accountability for everything, so i want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

first, i want to assure everyone that i didn't contact that girl ever again. since i moved, i no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (i don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. i have avoided getting any information about her at all). the way i acted and the way i hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but i know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. if she wants to get closure by talking to me, i'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. i don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. i learned in my classes that men do that a lot. i don't want to hurt her anymore, so i will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

i was distraught after my last post here. i admit i came here looking for validation, not help. i had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that i was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that i needed help. all of these people were right. i don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive i was in response to the comments). i checked myself into therapy in michigan the week after i posted here. i knew something was wrong, but i was still in denial. i thought i needed help with heartbreak. i didn't recognize that i actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that i used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. after a few sessions, i started seeing a psychiatrist too. i got on mood stabilizers and i started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way i was acting. something that couldn't be cured by medication. after talking it over with my therapist, i decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my aunt's house. within a month of me posting here, i had moved into her house. 

after moving, i started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. i had a fresh idea of the issues i wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that i was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in michigan (though i wasn't stalking anyone at this point, i was just obsessing in my mind. which is still bad, but i wasn't actively victimizing anyone). i realize that in addition to therapy, i needed more help. my therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so i signed up voluntarily. i attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. the goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  i know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? people like me. people like me in the last post. i look like a normal person. i grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. monsters come in all shapes and sizes and i fooled myself by saying because i didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because i wasn't ""like"" the abusers i saw on tv, that i wasn't one. but i am. i can't take back what i've done, but i can promise myself i will never victimize anyone else again. 

in conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. i want to say that i do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. i made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because i thought i had the right to dictate how others interact with me. the class is a year-long class and i have only been in it for a month, but i have already learned so much. i have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. but i believe that since i've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. i've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so i made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people i am stalking or believe i am in love with (i talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and i'm sorry for how i decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice i asked for.

**tl;dr**: i ceased, i desisted, and i got mental health help. thanks to everyone.

**edit**: wow, just wow. i didn't expect this response. i guess this is a top post of all time. 
i wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. i read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though i didn't reply to many. i cried a lot while reading them. 

2. i didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. i'm not sure why i did it, but i don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. i don't know if i deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. but thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. i've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program i am in. the program i am in is specific to my area, so i'd rather not disclose the name. however, i encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" i did some research today about the class i am in and that is what these types of classes are called. they all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. there is no official federal program i don't think.

4. i am not healed. i have a lot of obsessive thoughts and i have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. my meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process i need to change and that cant be done with pills. i have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. i have never had real ""friends"" until the ones i have now. before jaime, i definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women i had crushes on and men i wanted to be friends with. it was never as bad as it was with jaime, but i still am sure i made people uncomfortable.  i also have some self-harm behaviors i am working out. so to the person who was worried that i would use all of the good praise to say ""oh i'm perfect now so i can do what i want,"" trust me, i know i am fucked up and i want to change. i want to have normal relationships and friendships. i want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

please get help if you need it. take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",2
"update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. i'm back after 6 months.. you can read my old post here: florida: parents hired people to kidnap me. my brother ended up pointing a gun at them. what do i need to do to get emancipated?(https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

i sadly don't have any good news. just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. the camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

the place wasn't like anything i imagined it would be. i tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. they also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. whatever you do they see it as resistance. their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. even when i was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. it took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that i'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. i got to the point that i didn't care about anything anymore, i just wanted it to end.

they knew about my youtube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. they had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if i truly hate my old self or not. she'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also youtuber) and i was supposed to agree with her, if i took things personally they knew i was acting and wasn't ready.

they got me when i was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. the next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. i was thinking all the time and effort i placed there was gone.

from there i didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. so things became easier. they'd teach me to be a nice girly christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. it was like they were sending me into a children's book. then my dad came and brought me back home.

when i got back my brother actually told me that my youtube account wasn't deleted. since i was using his email for recovery he got a notification when i logged in from the camp because it was a new place. so he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. so my account is intact. the assholes at the camp were lying.

i don't know if i'm the same person or not or how much i've changed but i really hate my parents. i hate them so much that a year ago i couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. there are 448 days until i'm 18 and i'm counting every single day until this is over and then i'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

my big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who i trust. when i was gone he went to police, cps, even talked to a lawyer and a pi to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. my parents came after my $15,000 which i had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. but my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. he continued to post the videos that i had prepared in the pipeline when i was gone so i continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

that's it for me. from what i understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",2
"can i get a paternity test on myself?. hi, i'm 16 y/o and have good reason to think my mom and dad aren't my real parents. i had a much older sister who killed herself when i was 6. she was 26 when she died. all of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. i don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. my parents don't talk much about her. there's a painting in our house that she painted. it's a very nice painting of a swamp. it's my favorite thing. i decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. what i found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. i felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then i read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. it's really short and i didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical i guess is the word. anyways i asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why i would ask that. i said idk i just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. she got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. well i started thinking about it. i am the spitting image of my sister but i don't look like my mom or dad. i casually asked my mom to see my birth certificate the next day and she got mad again and wouldn't let me see it.

this monday my mom and stepdad sat me and my 4 siblings down. they told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more ""stable"" location within a spiritual community. according to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their ""mind awakening"" school where ever we move. i tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. according to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. i've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but i've been unable too. they cut of the internet, phone and tv tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. i'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way i've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. i was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is ""closed"" and that i will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the ""leaders"" will love to meet me and put me in their programs.

&#x200b;

i need to know what the fuck i can do here. my dad has shared custody of me and since monday i've had no contact with him. he is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been ""informed"" and supports this 100%. i tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. he lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. i'm at a friends house because i was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after i told my parents i wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and i plan to stay here tonight if i can. my parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"".

&#x200b;

i'm so lost right now it makes me sick. i do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and i need to know what the fuck i can do here. can i just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. if my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.

&#x200b;

edit:

i talked to my mom and told her because i would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times i could see my friend i would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was ""trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view"". i got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. he did not agree and was told i didn't want to talk to him. my 15 year old sister's dad was told the same despite the fact he has primary custody and she only spends the summers with us. my sisters dad is going to call cps too and i just got done with my call to them but i wont repeat what they said here. i will be spending the night here and when my mom asks me to come back tomorrow my dad has told me not to go back and tell her that he will be flying down here to florida immediately if i don't check in with him or he hears i went back to her. he says that he is already looking into emergency custody (i want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great. they both have been great and are working with my dad right now to help me). i also will be going and buying a burner phone tomorrow and withdrawing all my money from the bank. my dad says he will handle getting my stuff from my mom when the time comes. thanks guys for the advice.",2

raised hell with the county commissioner for my district, showed them video and threatened to lawyer up, he pulled in the director for the road and bridge department then pulled in the director of zoning and planning.

my driveway is no longer a road and i am no longer being assessed for repairs and i am legally allowed to do what is necessary to stop traffic from crossing my property so both sides of the property have been ditched and bermed and a steel pole gate across the side i plan on keeping open. sheriffs dept has been out multiple times dealing with people trying to enter the property but they are starting to get the hint that road is closed.

we are currently in negotiations for a portion of my property to be purchased and turned into a road but not 10 feet from my house, there is a county commissioners meeting next tuesday and it is on the docket to be brought up.

&#x200b;

my driveway is no longer on google maps as a road, signage posted private property no trespassing, dead end road, etc etc etc. several people are angry about it as they are used to the pass-through but with the cameras i have installed i've been able to get clear images of vehicles and license plates of the worst offenders and they will be cited according to the sheriffs dept.

&#x200b;

i have contacted amazon and ups about their trucks crossing my property, ups has instructed their drivers to no longer use that route, haven't heard a thing back from amazon yet but i have stopped two of their trucks so far,both of which were ticketed by the sheriffs dept and the one needing a tow to get pulled off the berm it got stuck on.

i just want to know what action can be taken to potentially block the ballot from being counted and/or what can be done to press her father to understand that this is a serious crime and a clear breakdown of the democratic system.

"update i take prescription medication for adhd. started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. left old job for new one and now i'm unemployed.. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)

i am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

i met with an attorney for a consultation thursday. after talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has adhd. i could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. she told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as i could get punitive damages. i told her i don't want to sue anyone if i don't have to, i just want this job offer back as i have been waiting a long time for a job like this. she also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, i could file an eeoc charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. due to an unrelated incident a while back, i have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my google drive. i played the calls with my manager to the attorney. when my manager informed me of the preliminary result i explained to her my prescription medication and my adhd. the attorney told me it was good that i disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and adhd would not cause any issues in performing my duties). i was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. the call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but i would be paid for my one day of work. as far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if i knew i would fail. i had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

i asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because i signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. she would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. she said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. she said ultimately the point of having a lab test and mro is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the mro is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. if it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of hr and their legal department. when she initially talked to the head of hr, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. he called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. my attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if i could come into her office that afternoon. i agreed.

when i was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of hr, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. essentially this call was an apology to me. the head of hr profusely apologized for this. he went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in hr and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. if he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. he went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of hr felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. they want me to come back in monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. he stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they ""want nothing more than a person with my background on their team."" he even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch monday.

he told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my adhd. i told them that wasn't necessary as i am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

so now i have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of hr. i owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. i wish i could personally shake hands with all of you. i was so scared before reading your comments. thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

edit: i'm going to disclose my medication. i take vyvanse. a lot of people assume i'm taking adderall. i used to take adderall but my doctor suggested i try vyvanse when it came out. although similar and made by the same company, vyvanse is a much better medication for me. the release is more controlled, it's not as ""intense"" as adderall, my appetite is not affected, i sleep much better with it, and it doesn't give me the ""crash"" that adderall does when wearing off.

"ex-wife is suing me for child support. i don't even have a penis... (update). original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/585svt/exwife_is_suing_me_for_child_support_i_dont_even/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

i have both good news and bad news.

the good news is that i won the battle with my ex. i put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. i had documents about me showing i don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (i don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before i married her. however paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. that ended the case. it took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but i won. i don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. maybe she thought that i won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.

the bad news is that, i'm dying. as i mentioned in the comments of my original post, i was battling cancer at the time that i made the post. it was the fourth time in my life that i was dealing with cancer and even though i had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and i have very little chance of beating it again. i will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. i'm happy with the life i've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until i finally rest for good. 

thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. it helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. you could see from my comments on the original post that i was almost ready to give up. ",2
"(az) our neighbors dog was poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. i say absolutely not. how should we proceed?. i guess some background is in order here. earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. we were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. the next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. they did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. the next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. this all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

so they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. we tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

so we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. we have yet to contact the lawyer. 

we had made the initial report to animal control last thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" i was really taken aback and i think i asked ""i think so, do you need some?"" 

he then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. i literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. i explained that i actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and i really have no way of knowing which dog is which). he said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" i got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


the officer then asked if he could take everything. i said i wasn't comfortable with that but i would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. i did exactly this. i was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. again i was taken completely aback and said that i'm not sure what he'd be looking for. he told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. it took me as second but i asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. i asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if i remember) ""not yet."" 
i asked him if i could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. i said i would really rather not but i would get back in touch with him. he gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

i just got home and told my wife. my wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. we have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but i feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

she thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. i say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. i'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. wife thinks we should let them, i say absolutely not.

>edit: hey guys i'm involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in dm but it would sure be easier if i could just answer them once. i'm sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, i really don't want to say where i am and my attorneys name. all the laws i found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

so thank you to everyone who responded. and i guess thank you to everyone in the dms who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, i want to sleep in my own house. just to allay the fears of the other nice dm's, i did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

i took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on monday night. i also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. i called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

he was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the da actually pursuing this were slim to none. he did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, i could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. he said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


so basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as i type this) but i just heard (wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. in fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. the people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. they also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all i know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people i've ever encountered). the can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). so with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

so our complaint to animal control from last thursday is still on the books. the lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. the criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

"cops completely destroyed interior of my car looking for drugs, found nothing. i had purchased a used cadillac a few months ago for a good price from a mechanic i knew. he said his son was driving it. when i first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of bho oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. i threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. 
flash forward to the other night and i was pulled over for an improper lane change. officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when i was being pulled over. he asked to search the vehicle and which point i said no. waited half an hour for the dog to show up. he alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  he checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. after his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. they cut into the leather seats. they also cut into my spare tire. mind you, i have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. they cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. i'm obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. after this well over 2 hour ordeal, i was told i was free to go. when asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. before i do that i would like to know if there's any better options and how i should pursue this. the seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there's so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what i probably would've payed for it. not to mention they also ruined my spare. thank you.

"neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs. for the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

at first i just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. however after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

i've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

she will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. i've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. i don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

when she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when i'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. before i started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. now since i've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. somehow this is my fault.

now i'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred german shepard, an english bulldog and a mix sheppard/bulldog).

i just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. i have a pool and if she falls in when i'm not home she could very well drown. that's why i installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, i truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

i've called the local child and family services office (cps) several times in the past two months to report it because i feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. i have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that i've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when i open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

i feel like i've done everything i can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. i just have no idea what to do now? i've debated calling the police when she enters but i don't know how that will escalate.",2

i went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. she talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

i scheduled an appointment with the bank. when i told them it's for a cash deposit they told me i don't need an appointment for that but i told them it's for a large deposit. they still said no appointment is necessary, but then i said it's a very large deposit. so they booked the appointment. everything went smoothly at the bank. they made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. money was in my account a few hours later.

i made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and i now have a larger emergency fund.

the monday following the incident i was asked to come speak with a vp of hr i'd never met and only knew by name, because they work directly for the company that bought ours out. when i walked in the conference room there were 4 people waiting for me, 2 of which i was told was part of legal. what i didn't realize, is my friend who i mentioned in the comments of the other post ended up saying something to another coworker because he was so horrified at the situation (even though i told him to keep it secret). this information ended up making it's way up the chain and was not taken well, to say the least. i was asked to explain exactly what happened, who i told, and asked a lot of questions. everything i said seemed to make them very uncomfortable, especially when i told them i was in touch with a lawyer. they had me leave the room for nearly 40 minutes and then called me back in and let me know they were very concerned about this situation, and assured me it was an isolated power trip basically....  

this is the holy shit part. they say that due to my long tenure in my position, knowledge of how the team works, and my relationship with clients that they felt i would be a good fit for the position the jerk manager sat in, and if i wanted the position it was mine, as their way of saying sorry. they also made sure to mention the large salary increase and bonuses this would come with. i took a couple minutes to think about it, and took the offer. btw i'm not stupid, i know they did this so i wouldn't take any legal action against them, but i love my job and don't blame them for the actions of a 20something on a power trip. i also know it came down to he said/she said, and would've been a hard case to prove.

there's going to be a company-wide training on gender and interpersonal relations, and i finally have an office with a door i can actually close! i'm in the field a lot less now, so i guess the jerk got what he wanted, because now i don't interact face to face nearly as much as i used

a few months ago i posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town i live in sent a letter demanding that i take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. most of the comments i received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my first amendment rights, and yes, i should seek a lawyer. 

so i did so. i set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. however, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended i speak with someone ""outside the city's little sphere of influence"". 

skipping over unnecessary details, i met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. i updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about "" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services"". 😉

once i updated the website and the city realized i wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. i went, although now i realize i probably should not have done so. he was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought i should take down the website because it was hurting the town and ""we both want what's best"" for it. he also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think i should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. i declined the interview, because i was afraid i'd get sued (whether justified or not) if i said something the city didn't like.

of course, i was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. so she ran her story, and i was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. what's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. they were also quoted as saying ""there may be legal stuff coming down the road"".

a few weeks later i received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. it was the attorney from the original letter writing ""on his own time"" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. he told me i was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. the letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.

this was around mid-january, 2018 (i received the first letter mid-december, 2017). everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until i got an email from the legal director at the aclu of iowa. on the advice of reddit, i had emailed both the aclu and the eff, but after over a month with no response i had figured they were too busy to look at my case. i was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.

i spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the aclu of iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. toward the end of february we filed suit in federal court, and by march 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:

1. they had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content i produce regarding the town.
2. they must pay legal damages to me.
3. they must pay attorney fees to the aclu.
4. they must write an apology letter to me.
5. my favorite part, the city's staff *and its attorneys* must take first amendment training.

all in all, i'm incredibly impressed with the aclu's work on this case. i know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but i think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were. i'm super grateful to the aclu for helping me with this, because as i said above, i wouldn't have been able to afford an attorney and the city would have gotten away with their threat. i'm also grateful to r/legaladvice for encouraging me to contact the aclu -- thank you for all of the help!",2
"update my landlord shut off the electricity in the middle of a heat wave. original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cg42cd/my_landlord_shut_off_the_electricity_in_the/

this happened in ny.

i'd like to thank everyone who replied to that post. it was very helpful.

after the post my so and i decided to get a hotel. when we came back this morning the power was back on. my neighbor told me what happened:

shortly after we'd left, someone in the building called 911 because their son was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion (he's fine now btw). the firefighters were curious as to why the power was off. long story short, after the kid was safe they had a nice talk with the landlord about endangering a child's life to save some money, and she was asked to turn the power back on.

the poor kid's parents have already begun complaints to the relevant authorities. i'll be meeting a lawyer tomorrow about breaking my lease.",2
"my daughter was bit by a raccoon with rabies. my wife does not want to give our daughter the rabies series because its a vaccine. i am taking her tonight to a hospital against my wifes wishes in secret.. my daughter was playing with a wild raccoon last night and got bit. i killed a raccoon in the area foaming at the mouth. not sure if its the same one but refuse to take the chance. 

my wife vehemently refused the rabies series because its a vaccine. i am in panic mode and i am taking her to a hospital over 50 miles away near dallas. 

can i kidnap my own daughter? there is not a custody agreement in place because we are married and not separated. probably will be soon though. 

i need to know what to watch out for here and what to say to police if i get stopped. rabies is fatal so i am not playing with this one. 

i am leaving here in 10 minutes so just need to know a few things. 

is it kidnapping in this case?

will i be arrested? 

what do i do if she calls in an amber alert?

i am desperate.",2
"(update) nsw australia. last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. i jumped out because i'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. i now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.. original post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a2bj15/nsw_australia_last_month_a_friend_began_to_cross/)

i went to a lawyer my parents had used a few years ago and they recommended. she took one look at the letter from my friend aaron's lawyers and said she has concerns about it, and she'd respond. 

she contacted his lawyer, and my lawyer mailed me to tell me aaron's lawyers aren't his lawyers at all, but to contact her if i heard more otherwise no need for more action.

aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. he wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. i hadn't complained to them myself so i did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

thanks for the advice in the previous thread, especially /u/wittyandpithy's excellent not-practicing-legal-advice to actually pay to use a legal professional.

"update - dog ate neighbor's drone. *edit: original(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

a small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

i was served a summons by a sheriff's deputy, neighbor decided to take me to small claims over his drone. my mil is a paralegal secretary, so i was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. he seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. he also suggested i counter sue and how i could possibly add in more damages. 

he also told me that my neighbor and i technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under faa regulations. i called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). i don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. they took my information and have called me back once, so i know they're investigating but don't know anything else. not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

i brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos i had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. his main argument to the judge was that i ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which i (somehow) trained him to do"". which, yes i had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so i have somewhere to sit and eat outside. i argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. in the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). he is also banned from flying over my property, and i installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. he seems pretty upset with me, so i wanted to be careful. 

the only thing that could make this better is if the faa finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.",2
"doctor's office keeps telling my mom my test results. i'm 22 and no longer even live with her.. background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. my gp who i have seen since i was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. i moved away for college when i was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new gp and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since i've seen him half my life. 

i get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication i take to make sure that i'm not getting too little/too much. the results of this information or the fact that i have those tests done isn't a big secret i want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless i were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. 

the first time i had this work done, i hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. they even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/ml the medication level was. again, it's not like to my mother this is anything i want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and i never received any call about my results. i go in for these monthly, so the next month that i went i told the woman working in the lab of the office that i wanted to update my information to make sure i got the results (i thought also since i had been seeing this doctor since i was 10 i probably had never given them my phone number). a few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; i again got no call from the office. once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when i explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, i was a little tipped off that i wasn't called again. i chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. 

at this visit i had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. he asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. i wasn't worried that i was pregnant, but i knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. i asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. it did, so on my way out i stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that i and i alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. they nonchalantly agreed and i asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. i happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. my mom blew up at me asking why i needed to take a pregnancy test (i didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). that all blew over, but at this point i was pissed that she kept getting this information. 

i ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of hipaa and she knows it after working in a hospital. she laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since i was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, ""it's not a big deal - i'm your mom!""

since then, i've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. to no surprise there are no issues. i don't really know what to do here. since i cut ties with that doctor, i no longer have personal problems with this, but i'm sure other people do without even knowing it. i don't have resources really for a lawyer. i might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. so how serious is it really?

"mother took 500$ dollars from my account to pay tithing that i said i don't want to pay. so my parents are heavily mormon and we just recently had a tithing settlement and when they asked me if i had paid my tithing i told them no. they then asked me if i had a plan to fix that and i told them that i worked too hard just to give that money away.

anyways so afterwards, my mom, who is my account co-owner as i am under 18, decided to take 10% of my bank account out and refuses to give it back.

this isn't legal right?

*update: i plan to slowly over the next few days, withdraw the money over time. i will leave some in as to not look suspicious. i will try talking to my mom about paying the 500$ just to keep her on my good side. 

*update 2: ok now this has gotten ridiculous.

turns out my dad is sick of my mom overspending so he did two things. he's stopped paying tithing himself and swapped my moms credit card for a debit card. my mom took my money to pay off tithing for him and she gave me roughly 200$ back. she said she'll give me the rest back and that she's still disappointed in me for not paying my tithing. i'm at a loss what to do next.

*update 3: doesn't sound like i'm getting my money back any time soon, both my parents are in a significant amount of debt, my parents fought a lot yesterday apparently. my mom spent almost 10,000$ on stuff for the past month or so. my dad has started making cuts in our budget to fix this, tithing being one of them. 

i'm still following through with taking my money and putting it in a place where my parents can't touch it. just in case they get any ideas.",2
"co my retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. i fear that she intends to abuse other children and i want to stop it. i have proof of her abuse against me. how do i go about this?. between the ages of 9-11, i took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. if memory serves, i believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that i took lessons with her. the only reason i stopped going to her was because she retired. 

my teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". i won't get into specifics, but i have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

i never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

recently, i found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. i am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and i want to stop it before it's too late.

so my question is: legally, what can i do and what should my course of action be? i don't want money, i just want her stopped.

i have the photographs, but i am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

please walk me through this, because i genuinely don't know what to do, and i'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because i didn't stop it sooner.

"update neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. now she's trying to sue me. we're the ones with 29k in medical bills. nc usa. here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=jsce6bw3&sh=7f56780f


my sister and i spent the weekend after i posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
the guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
he is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

the neighbors mean dog has been put down.  she was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

we've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

she was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
one from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  i'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

one for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

her lawsuit against me has a court date of march 5th.  after she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   she then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

she finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in nc where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

now for some extra facts. 

my left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on february 27th. 

our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  the vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  she still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

the destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

the day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  she broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  she straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  she also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

we called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. they asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

the video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  it shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. it also shows her audibly laughing during it. she only started trying to help when i started smashing her dog into the ground. 

we also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the hoa. 

he said it's pointless to go after the hoa and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  our lawyer did tell us that the hoa has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

there was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

i honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

either way, my sister and i both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of march. 

thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. you guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

i'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  please feel free to ask any questions and i'll answer whatever i can.

i went to my parents and talked to them and they have begun to see that they were wrong too. me and my dad went last night and apologized to the shop owner for our actions and how we treated him and the victim of my brother and that we agree with his ban. the owner was genuinely happy with us for this so i'm glad we did that. the girl who who my brother touched was also at the store and despite what many of you said i felt that i needed to apologize to her too because she deserved it after my actions and she thanked me for it. my parents are now looking into different options to deal with my brother including therapy and other programs. 

&#x200b;

i really want to end this by saying thank you for helping me learn i was wrong. like i said i'm sorry if i hurt anyone with my post, i didn't mean to do that but it was wrong of me too. this has been a learning experience for me and i hope that i can become a better person because of it.",2

"a former air bnb guest put a hold on my mail for everyone at my address and has been paying to hold the mail for 2 months! (texas). its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  one guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  a lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  one lady missed the receipt of a death certificate.  we thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  so i tried calling the usps and that got me nowhere.  going down in person was the only way to do this i guess.  turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal po box?  who knows.  the post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  still, how could this have happened?  surely this can't be legal.  i got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  she hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one.

"can you legally steal your own property hours after a police officer hands it to the thief?. yesterday my phone was stolen at lunch and i chased down the girl who stole it making a scene in the mall. a plano police officer overheard the commotion and came over.

the girl tried to say i was trying to steal her phone. i told the officer that i could unlock the phone and the girl could not, i told him my pictures are on the phone, my bank information was on the phone, and basically my entire life was there to prove it was mine. 

he refused to give me the chance or believe me. he told me to back off and leave her alone or he would arrest me. 

i left. 

the girl was wearing a uniform of one of the shops in the mall so i decided to check back 2 hours later. i saw her set my phone down by the cash register of her work after failing again to break into my phone. 

when no one was in her store and her back was turned i took my phone back. 

before anyone starts going off on me for it, i know. i know exactly what i did was extremely stupid but i am still paying for that phone so...yeah. 

i am asking for the legalities of it.

the phone was set on a counter and not in an area that would be considered employee only, the store was open, and the phone is legally mine. 

the place is obviously heavily video monitored so there is no doubt that i am on video. my questions are simply did i break any laws?

if the phone was on the counter, not behind the register but on the counter, the store was open and i was not asked to leave, and the phone is legally my property did i break the law?

edit: this post got more traction than i was expecting. i'd really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where i am. i grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. from elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

they've had dramatic changes over the years. in high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). a decade later, i can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. it's become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. many middle/high school kids have lan parties. smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). my library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

even though i prefer pin-drop silence, i have no issues with these changes. **it's better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. and putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!",9

i guess i can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what's worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. most american employers/career help centers i've met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won't go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

a few people have mentioned latex. i use latex often in my math coursework, but i'm not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. pages (on mac) has been sufficient for me.

as far as linkedin go, it's a less-detailed version of the master document i keep, as far as work experience goes, but i go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on linkedin than i do on paper.

"college isn't the only way to start a good career. apprenticeships, trade schools, and military training can be great alternatives in today's world.. the price of four-year universities in the us, among other countries, is huge and growing. there are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

if, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**to high school juniors and seniors:** 

your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. if you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. here(https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

these jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. as that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. according to this article(http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. anecdotally, i work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**is there any money in it?**

there definitely can be. unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. i'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until _ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt later. 

that's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. there are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. you're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**what are my options?**

there are a ton of ways to start a career, but i'll talk about a few.

**apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

a recent report(https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from npr took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in germany's industrial success. the us government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. the federal program is here(https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest american job center(https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

the federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. in a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. one example would be the ibew(http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so i won't bother trying to list a bunch. searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**trade schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. there are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. job corps(https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. it isn't for everyone as i understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but i know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. a computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**military** training can also be a great economic ladder. the pay and benefits are good from the start. depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. there are some huge risks associated with this route though, so i would reserve it as a last resort. 

regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. that is not the only income, though. in most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. that's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. on the outside, that would cost a lot.

regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. you could also be a bus driver. you don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. i would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. i really enjoyed most of the time i spent in the military. there were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. the good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. the bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

i know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. in reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**tl;dr**

if you want to get smart, go to college. if you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**edit:** based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. as a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the af lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""no thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

also about the military, i offered it up as a last resort, and i mean that. plenty of commentators are saying ""don't ever think about joining the military for training!"" i don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. you would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. if you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

regarding rotc, it is better than nothing. i intentionally didn't mention it though. my philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing rotc vs my immediate family and i enlisting. if you do rotc, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. after 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. if you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the af, can't say how easy it is in the others. so you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. from a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. additionally, i had a way better time than any officer i know, and i didn't even like the military. the lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. i wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

still relevant to rotc, but about school in general... a ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. i'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful lpt. you have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",9

my neighbourhood has a lot of crows. over twenty of them. they are generally on good terms with one another.

i watched them band together and kill one of the crows. they left its dead body in my yard. i waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because i don't want crow guts everywhere.

however, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. this brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. none of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time i am outside. some swoop. they are becoming more and more aggressive.

i wanted to know if it was instant? would it hurt? did he burn alive? 

i told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn't even know what happened, but reading online i don't know if that's true. 

i'm crying right now, it just sucks and i miss him terribly. 

edit: for those asking, this accident happened last may. the emotions are raw and fresh again because easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.

i had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

with it coming up again, i just keep thinking why did i cancel? we could have had one last day with him but we didn't. i want to go up this year, in his memory but i don't know if i can. 

edit 2: thank you everyone for the kind words and thoughts and answers. 

i didn't think i'd get this many responses, i honestly just randomly wrote this question trying to help myself with the new grief and pain i was feeling in the moment. 

truly, thank you everyone for taking the time to answer and respond.

"matched with girl on tinder. profile said 18, got phone number, she calls and reveals she's 10.. i blocked her and the texts were super short and completely non sexual. she randomly calls me and i was like shit she sounds super young. i text her and ask if she's 18. she said yes. later she texts me and said she was lying. she facetimes me and she's in fucking kid pajamas and says she's 10 and calls me stupid. 

this is dangerous. what can i do to notify her parents ?  it is an att number. should i call them? 



edit : i looked up the number on social media. nothing. i reported it to tinder using their online form. 

she used fake pictures of course. i could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. i will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. i reported it to tinder and that's all i will do. some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. the second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) i hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. she revealed she was 10 while i was in the process of blocking the number.

then people made fun of me when they knew i'm a virgin. even my relatives laughed behind my back too.

i made a post in a tech subreddit. not only people didn't answer my question, but also they stalked my profile and made fun of me being a virgin. 

i know it might not be a big deal. but i felt so down after that. i felt like i should commit a suicide for being a useless loser in this world... 

do i have hobbies? yes, but most of them don't involve interactions with people. i keep a big fish tank and i love them. i play video games too. i've been rescuing stray dogs since i moved here. i used to volunteer at my local shelter but since i adopted my dog here and got busy with school i volunteer much less nowadays...

"update my 32m best friend 30 f asked if i would be her sperm donor for her surrogate, i am in love with her but sje has no idea.. i appreciate all the feedback, most of you were nice. there was a few idiots telling me i needed to be alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. 

anyway the consensus with my rl friends was i needed to tell her. we do brunch on saturdays because she does yoga sundays so we met up this morning. 

i could barely eat and she could tell something was up. she got worried thinking i was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

i sat her down and told her everything how i realized i was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. i told her that i never said anything because i did not want to jeopardize our friendship. her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

i honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and i honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. she half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

we hugged and i told her that there is no one on this earth i would want to have a child with but her. we talked for hours ,in fact i just got home. we have decided that we want to focus on us for now. i want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

i know that this isn't a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

however i am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

thank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her

"i (m28) broke up with my ex-fiancee (f27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. i am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.. hey guys,

i need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

a little background: 

me and my ex-fiancee had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. i was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. she was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

back in april of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. i once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

it all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in june because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. that was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. i didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. i fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. it made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

everything was kinda ok until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. the picture was of my ex-fiancee at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. i fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. she was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

when i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

she cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. i was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

i told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. she begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

i did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancee had comitted suicide. her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

i am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancee friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

i am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",8

managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but i chickened out half way through what i had to say :(

the good news is that i am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

thank you for all your support, everyone, i will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

my grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

i will let you know how i manage.

thank you again.

pretty much the title. i have no idea how to process all this, and i am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

both my older brother and sister went to the same college. my brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. both had their college paid by our dad. dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

my brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

my sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

i got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. i always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

instead i was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how i am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. he said it was never is place to say anything since i am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

apparently my grandparents know i am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

my siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as i am because there was never a hint of anything being off. i might be naive, but i always thought i had a great relationship with my dad. we go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when i had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. i never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. i mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. it's a story he tells from time to time. he likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

my mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

i feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. i am not even sure i will be able to go to college any more, i always assumed my parents will pay for it. i never had a job, and i am not sure what job i can even get to support me through college, i have no idea how to apply for loans.

all my mom has done is cry and apologize. but nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

i don't even know if i am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, i feel shame leaving my room, and if i will be asked to move out i don't know where to go. i don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

i am angry at my mom, i am confused about where i stand with my dad. there's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. i feel rejected and i have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

anyone have any idea what to do here?

do i apologize to my dad? what do i say to him?

idk, i've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. i have no idea what to do.

hi all. first off, i want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or pm. i am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support i received and i spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as i read your messages and well wishes.

the night after i wrote my original post, i wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/witchy_woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

""dear \wife's name\,

i love you more than you can imagine and the most i want in this world is for you to be happy. i understand that as a man i probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. i'm doing my best to help you but the fact that you won't help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. i honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don't make an effort to get better. however, i want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. i'm ready to talk whenever you are.

with all my love,

\my name\""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

i put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. the next morning (march 16th), i woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed oj. when i walked into the bedroom with her food, i saw her reading my letter. when she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. full on, niagara falls level crying. i hugged her tighter, told her ""i love you so, so, much"", and started crying too. i honestly don't know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. it could've been 10 minutes, it could've been an hour, i didn't care. when she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. reddit, you guys don't know how thrilled and proud i was when i heard those words. she then asked me if we could go on a trip to japan because in her words ""i really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.""

i was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. she's always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels i saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. we just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. we have a 5am uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

"update i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i talked to her.. i would like to preface this post with an apology. i know it has been nearly three weeks since i last posted. to be honest, in no world did i ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. i've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original it, i have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. for that, i am sorry.

for the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. it is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

for the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a greek tragedy, i apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

now to start where things left off.

after making my original post, i combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a plan b box and thrown it into the garbage. a lot of them made sense. my greatest hope was that it might have just been old. maybe it was before we even met. clinging to that, i hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. i'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what i would say in response, and what i would do. i memorized them all.

on the evening after i made my original post, i called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. as i had practiced, i asked her the following question:

>hey, i'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up plan b box in the garbage? 

the second the words ""plan b"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. she was completely lost for words. i already knew at that point. i retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>why was there a torn up plan b box in the garbage? you know i had a vasectomy. 

she just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. then she looked to the floor. then she started weakly sobbing. 

this was not on the flowchart. i had no idea how to respond. i thought if i let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. finally i prompted her with another question:

>are you crying because you did something you regret?

she shook her head violently. i was so concerned because i thought something horrendous might have happened.

she abruptly shrieked ""i'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" i have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

so i prompted her again. 

>just tell me why it was there. you don't have to hide anything from me.

she yelled at me again. repeatedly. ""if you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""fuck you for not trusting me.""

this line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. i refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, i wasn't budging an inch. she then informed me that either i had to leave or she would leave. since i doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), i agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. i went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

the following night, i texted her asking if she was ready to talk. she was not. instead, she gave me an ultimatum: i had to 1 apologize, 2 promise to never bring it up again, and 3 learn to trust her completely. only then would she allow me back home. if i couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

i have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. i am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. i currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. the lawyer will probably tell me i'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

there is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. i am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. none of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. i'm holding off on saying anything until i'm calm and rational and won't do something i'll regret in the future.

**tl;dr** yes, she cheated, yes, the marriage is over, and yes, i feel awful about it. ",8
"update my grandparents don't approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don't want me (f24) to marry him (26). i don't know what to do, since i don't want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).. hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my previous post. (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

it was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that i come clean to sam. i did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. i asked him how he's taking it so well and he told me he's experienced something similar before. 

his cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. he told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. they wouldn't allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he ""got his head straight"". 

he then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. he told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

sam joked that he wouldn't give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they'd be in love with him. 

well i think it's working. sam and i have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night i notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. sam and my grandpa are both ww2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with sam. 

i decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. i got there before sam, and i could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought i had come alone_. they asked where sam was, when he was coming etc. then they said we wouldn't start eating until he arrived. 

i'm just so incredibly happy that i get to keep both relationships.",8
"update : wife (38f) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. it's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks i am going to abandon her and ""our twins"". it has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.

^((original post)(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

i called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . he seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  he said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. i sat her down and we talked. all she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . i tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. i asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. she said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . so i did. she kept changing subjects or saying that "" a mother just feels it. you wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". she got very agitated and was crying telling me that if i wanted to leave her i should simply leave but i shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200b;

somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

after she did i went on her computer. i do **never** snoop on her. but i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . oh boy. she was in 2 facebook groups. one was a normal mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. in the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. they were feeding in each others delusions. a woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. my wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. so many women were making her fear that i would leave. saying things like men can not stick to a woman . many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

i was really fucking scared. i researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of schizophrenia(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3361851/). so to say the least i could not sleep. i was and am still very afraid of losing her. she woke up and i tried to act like nothing was wrong . we were going to the doctor. and it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. she was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. he was really tactful when talking to my wife. he tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. we tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. she got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . she began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . we could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . she could not breathe. the doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . she had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. did an ekg to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

at that point i really had no other option than to inquire about involuntary commit. so i could not do it myself . i needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . after that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". so far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . my wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. when i last her she was furious with me. she said i was taking away her freedom which i am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. she is so mad at me. i feel like i am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. i love her with all my heart. i am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . i feel like i failed to protect her. at this point i am just rambeling . sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . i feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : i will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! when i gave my vows i meant trough illness and bad times. i am not only on the ride for the good times. if you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? i am here to stay. i will not divorce her. she is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. i hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

sorry for the rant. but if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. i understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it beginns to mess with their mental health  and i respect that but i won't do that.

edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. she was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

i don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as i was so distraught. but i was not a sedative. i think it was something along the lines of valium or baldrian. over the counter stuff mostly.

she has family. she is estranged from most of them. her sister is now at our place to help.

also refrain from such stupid comments like ""i'll bet she will leave bro. she is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. just seems like you want me to divorce. get a life.",8
"my (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before i get married.. my fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. we decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. everything was going great. he seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

i am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and i wasn't fussed so i agreed to saving it. he has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. i laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. no turns out he was dead serious. he wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know i am still 'pure'.

i told him fat chance i am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. he said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much i love him and that i have nothing to hide anyway as i am still a virgin. i left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

i want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. but at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and i dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

what the frick frack do i do. i am currently at my friends house and i might stay here for the night. tomorrow would be our last day as an unmarried couple and i am straight up panicking.",8
"i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.. throwaway, because reasons.

tl;dr: found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. asked girlfriend about it. she started yelling at me and crying and left.

i don't even know where to start with this. i'm dumbfounded. she just stormed out the house and i'm sitting on the bed asking myself a lot of questions.

i live a pretty normal life, and i thought so did my girlfriend. we've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. we started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. she would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. i'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. i always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, i wouldn't stop her.

this is where it takes a turn for the weird. i keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. i also go to the gym frequently, so i always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. i never kept count, but i know by just a visual glance i several pairs. this morning when i went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, i noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. i went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so i checked the washing machine and dryer. both were empty. i couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. so, i did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. after all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. she went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. when i went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. i told her i wasn't mad, i was just looking for my socks. she kinda mumbled ""i'll don't know."" i still wasn't mad, of course, but i was super confused. socks just don't disappear. so i asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""i'll buy you new ones!""

the first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. i thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so i joked with her about ruining my socks. wrong. thing. to. say. she started immediately crying. like, full on sobbing. at this point i don't care about the socks anymore, i want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. i sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. she just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. i tried assuring her again it was okay. even went so far as to say i would buy new socks and she didn't have to. i sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. i told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

on my way out i grabbed the garbage to take outside. when i got outside i lifted the lid off the garbage can and i noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. i could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. since i was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, i wanted to see for myself. i opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. there, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. as soon as the smell hit me i knew it was poop.

1. we don't own any pets.
2. we don't have any kids.
3. whose poop was on my socks?

work could wait. i couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. i grabbed the bag and walked back inside. as soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. she said i shouldn't be going through the garbage and that i was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. i asked her to calm down and that i just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. i wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. that's when it clicked. i don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. i asked her ""is this your poop?"" she started sobbing again and ran out of the house. i didn't go after her this time.

so, now i am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. the only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. i sent her text asking her to come back. she hasn't responded yet. i don't even know what i'm going to say when (if) she gets back.

update:

i had to leave for work and am now at work. yes, i threw away the bag of poopy socks. she texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. she said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to not bring it up in person. i'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as i can. her responses are super short, but i'm getting the idea.

i flat out asked her if it was a fetish. it is not a fetish. she confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. i found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. i had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? she thought i would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. she admitted she has done this for a long time. her reasoning, as best as i can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in any way. she uses socks because it covers her entire hand. after she's done with them, she throws them away. she used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

so, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. it could be worse, i guess. i hope we can laugh about this later. i'm trying to find the humor in it now, but i'm still weirded out.

"me 52m just found out at least 4 of my 5 children 33f30f28m24f14f are not mine. wife 51f wont say anything.. ***note: please do not use ancestry kits as a paternity test. if you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local medlab (medical lab). ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. in my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.***

--------------

i apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. i posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested i ask on r/parenting. but i also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so i want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

first of all, i'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, i am not really in the best state of mind. my world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. i just want to write as much context as possible so i can get the best advice needed. for obvious reasons, i am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

background: i met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. we have 5 beautiful children together - really, i consider them a total blessing regardless of what i'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago i thought that we had the perfect marriage. we were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, i feel like i've done everything a loving husband should do. i am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant i work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but i want to stress that i've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. and never in a million years would i ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. and the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested i was not her father. she confided this to me privately, showing me the results and i could tell she was visibly upset by this. of course, the first thing i did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and i'll always love her unconditionally. but secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. it comes back and i am indeed not her biological father.

this news really broke me. i'm ashamed to say i broke down in tears in front of my daughter. the combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset i was making my daughter by how i was reacting. i really wish i had kept it in for her sake, but i didn't.

following this i asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. i wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, i could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. however i didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really i didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

we tell the other three what has happened, i reassure them that i love them unconditionally and that i'll always be there dad, but that i need to know how long this has been going on. god, i can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. they didn't care i wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken i was. i feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

so we have paternity tests for each of the three done. not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. which somehow made it worse. it's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? i can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

so i confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. she doesn't confess. she doesn't even take it seriously. she says the tests must be flawed. all four? how the hell am i supposed to take that seriously?

i keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. when i bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""we've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. but how am i supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

now that i have rambled and explained what has happened. i guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. how can i reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? i feel like the way i have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times i reassure them.

2. how do i handle my youngest daughter? i feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and i will need to tell my daughter something. i don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but i also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. is there anyway, anyway at all, you think i could or should save my marriage? i've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. i know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. if there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, i want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. wife refuses to confess her infidelity. unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

edit: thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. i have not replied to as many comments as i should have, but i've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. i'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. again, i can't begin to thank you for all your support. if this is resolved i might post an update, but if she continues to lie then i don't think i'll bother, as there's not much more i can add. from the advice in this and the r/parenting thread i've decided to:

1. get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. tell my youngest of the situation. ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. it will be entirely her decision.

4. i'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. my mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and i owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), i have not ruled out some form of counselling. but at the moment i think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

once again i'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

edit2: i guess i should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **how did the ancestry results suggests i wasn't her father?** my family is entirely irish. no relatives outside of ireland other than my immediate family, and i even have the stereotypical red hair. my daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the british isles/western europe/northern europe. that's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **which two children share the same father?** my two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **how did your wife conceive your children?** our eldest daughter was not planned. all the others were planned. each time we conceived several months after we started trying. our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. she was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually i agreed. she was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **are you infertile?** i don't know. i've never had a fertility test done. but the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that i might be. i will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

"31m husband cheated on 27f me with his fit and skinny gym friend. i came home from work early (i'm an ob nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. at that point, i sort of already knew what i'd be walking into. my husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. she's beautiful and thin and everything i am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. so, i talked to him about it. he encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

i walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. they were having sex. in our bed. with a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. i silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and i've returned to the hospital. he called me asking why i wasn't home and i told him my shift is extended but in reality, i'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as i type this.

i feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. i don't even know how to proceed. on one hand i want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, i'm an ugly woman....its not like i can do better. i just want to die. i feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. advice please.

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all for the kind comments and support. please stop commenting, however. i think i've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). i don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. i still have no idea what i am going to do and i know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. he was a great husband and i can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. i don't know if i will stay, but that's all i really know right now.

&#x200b;

edit: i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while i'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how i should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. it is incredibly upsetting and i am already going through a lot. i feel i need to clarify since everyone seems to care that i had food after i found out. i had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which i had been all over the place. i had lunch at 11am and nothing else until i left. i was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. please stop harassing me about that.",8
"update: my sister (f22) ripped up my(f19) stan lee autograph and i haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (f46) is pressuring me to. thanks for the great advice. so a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

i explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who stan lee was. surprisingly she understood just perfectly. i was relieved. for a moment i thought that my dad and i would get shit from everyone.
my sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". i told her that she asked me and i just told the truth.

but what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. she again ridiculed my hobby and so on. one of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. the dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. she is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

my mom and sister came back in the morning. they didn't talk much to us . my mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. we had a short dry conversation till she asked me why i was making such a big deal about it. and i shut her up like you guys told me to. i started by explain who stan lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. it's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. you said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because i didn't lend her my jacket ""

ya'll my mom cried. she apologized profusely. she said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as i was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

my mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.",8
"update mom had an affair 18 years ago, i 18m am the product of it. my dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.. the reaction to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

i am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and i am still processing it.

i did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and i know where i now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

i am not sure i would have had the courage to say what i had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

i think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. it makes me uncomfortable knowing i am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. a lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

i have so far went through 40% (i estimate) of the comments, but i have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

the conclusion is that i am definitely going to college, it will be the college i have always wanted to go to, and i will have the same experience as my siblings. the money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

what started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then i showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

my parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when i came back pregnant"", or something like that, i was not there, this is what she told me. i guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision i ever made"" or something like that. and their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

yeah, it went downhill from there fast. shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here i am.

dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

i did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. my brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

my grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, i guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

reading the comments was a mind opening experience. i felt unprepared for the world out there. many have asked how i had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. of course i knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

i went from ""i am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and i will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. for me it was a sudden change in reality.

going through the comments i managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. really good stuff that i think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

my parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and i haven't even read all comments. i can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. i understand his reaction, but i still feel hurt by it. i understand he was not in the best place of mind, but i can't control my feelings either. we will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

mom hasn't handled everything that well. but she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

when mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. he kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. so my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (i am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

the man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. he was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, i guess he had more important things to do. but it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

and i don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. i thought about the matter the last two weeks, since i've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if i have other siblings out there.

i was suggested to go and buy a dna kit from 23andme, maybe i can find him that way, but i think i will avoid doing this specifically so i don't find him or he finds me. as far as i care, i have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

moving forward i do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like i would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

my mom admits i've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

i did learn where i stand with my family, and it's safe to say that i am loved, and i have options. i thought i am isolated, but my world is wider than i thought. grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

i think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, i think i will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

thank you.

edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.",8
"update: wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**tl;dr:** wife and i tried having a baby. my balls are blocked, surgery is in july. wife got pregnant anyways. it seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but i was told i shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. wife is celebrating, i can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. seeing doctor on monday to see if it could be mine.

update **tl;dr** at bottom

first i just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  i can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

i took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  i had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  it wasn't until i got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that i was able to try and move on.  my wife and i actually met in a soccer league we were in together. we've had so much trust for so long that i thought those fears had gone away.  it wasn't until now that i really started to feel shaken like that again.

but i didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  a few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

it's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. i didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  i got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. i couldn't wait any longer.  i made our favorite omelets, and told her i needed to talk about something.

""you know i'm not ashley, right?""

she knows me well.  ashley's my ex who cheated.

so first i apologized.  i apologized because i let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  what should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

we talked for a while.  i told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. i told her how much i loved the relationship that we've built together, and i felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  she had never given me a reason not to trust her and that i still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  she thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  she volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

but something still felt off.  i honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  normally she would have been upset that i didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling i couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

it seemed like she was saying all the right things, but i couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  maybe i'm just being paranoid.  maybe there's a gut feeling that i need to listen to.  but i ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if i still needed the surgery.

turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  i've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. so i brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. the urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that i wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. he mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

being there didn't really help.  i feel like i just got more uncertainty.  

she had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  we talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. she seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. she promised to do it in the morning.  i asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

there's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  i really couldn't put my finger on it.  we were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and i couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had sunday.

i've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but i haven't been able to focus.  we have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  this morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. we don't do that, she's never needed to before.  and i checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time thursday that i mentioned i was busy working on-site. we were supposed to go together.

i'm starting to go crazy. how do i bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  i'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  but i need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if i'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**tl;dr had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  urologist said i had obstructive azoospermia, implied i should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think i could be fertile.  wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when i can't go.  getting a second urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

update:  i've been trying to center myself.  we talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  she claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  i didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  i'm just trying to not overreact right now. i don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and im a father! or...not.  thankfully she's not working late today.  

thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

update:  i went for a long run to clear my mind.  gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  i'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why i've still been struggling personally with some of them.  regardless of what happens i'm done with any confusion left between us.

  thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

"yesterday, my(33m) wife's (34f) best friend (female) contacted me and told me that her husband and my wife were having an affair and my 3yo daughter is actually his daughter.. wife and i have been together since high school. married for 10 years. i'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. 

my wife's best friend megan and i work for the same company( different departments ). so yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. so i met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. i tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. 

according to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. she confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. 

and when i confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when i told her that megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. 

i really don't know what to do. i mean, everything was a lie right? my little girl taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. what do i live for now? i just don't know what to do. just here for some advice. i'm sorry if this felt like a rant.",8
"update: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but i'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. do i say anything?. original post is here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

so i got lots of feedback on what to do here. a good majority of the commenters told me to say something. to clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but i was never planning on doing nothing. of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. i just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which i ended up getting from alison, the third party friend. some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me i was a bad friend. some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. well all of you were somewhat right. here's how it went down: 

i messaged alison early on in the day, shortly after i made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. i said to alison that i needed to tell aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. this was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that alison came over too. we all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about mary. alison showed him the text screenshots of mary talking to her ex, and also told aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

what was the most surprising was his reaction. he took it very well. he first got very quiet, and just nodded. aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. he was not aware of the hookups, but he and mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. he told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. there were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. he knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

we started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. he cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. then he got angry. at her, and even more so at the guy. some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. we told him a million times how much better he deserved. he's definitely not going to marry her. 

thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. we saved a good man from heartbreak!

edit: jesus christ this exploded fast. thanks for all the kind words people 😅",8
"happy update: wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

i'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  i definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what i posted.  but hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes i guess.

anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  i told her everything that was going on.  the urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  i told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

she agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  she didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  she knew i was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. we talked about it sunday, but i can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  and so while she had thought we were communicating, i wasn't.  we decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

the money was the real problem for me. she agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  she offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if i really wanted we could move the money back.  she does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

we read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  it seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (cbavd) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. we're going to go back to the original specialist i was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  it turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  i told her i took off work to go with, and she was relieved i could join.

once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  after going through each thing i was just wishing i believed her a little more before. she's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. she even offered an open phone policy if i needed.  we did look at the text i had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  i declined though right now, since i don't want to be that husband.

this has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  that level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  i think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. i was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  this has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but i'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

she thought that an nipp asap was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  i'm not big on therapy, but i can probably agree that it will most likely help.

i'm feeling a little better about everything.  thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (every other comment here i read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   it's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**tl;dr  use your words. - wife and i objectively went through everything.  we both apologized, getting a nipp soon and hopefully a therapist.**

tldr: mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.


i just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. this will be my final update.

a few days ago, the abortion was carried out. during the weeks beforehand, my gf went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. she was also tested for any stis (she's clear!).

she went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. a few days ago it was successfully carried out.

they went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. gf said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

when she came home, she cried and cried and cried. she says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

we took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). while in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

she's amazing, man. seriously.


update on the mum! so my gf received a call from her mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

my gf and i have an agreement that if mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. in this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

i told the mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. i then said ""how jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

my gf didn't find it funny...

anyway, that's it.


good luck to everyone in their lives.

-she texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 pm (she's closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-i tried to facetime her 11:51 pm just to say goodnight, she didn't pick up. i tried messaging her but no response. 

remember that spare phone that's with me where her google account is logged in? i browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there's a ""google assistant"" command recorded at 11:48 pm.

i played and listened. there's her voice and a voice of another guy. they were goofing around at the google home device. so yeah. 

i confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 am.  she kept on denying she's cheating.

then i laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

she finally admitted. 

i am single.

"can't wait until thursday....my(48m) wife(44f) is going to be shocked. **\*\*\*update\*\*\***(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

so, wife and i have been together 17 years.  we are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  about two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  so off we got to the gp, who gives us a consult to a rheumatologist.  come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  fast forward to a month ago, when our north texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  she woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were huge, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  and even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  so, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  so, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from ireland and custom designed, and have words in gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  she was absolutely gutted.  i assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but i could tell, to her, it was.

begin sherlock holmes mode.  i googled until i couldn't google anymore.  i was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  i searched some more.  i finally found his personal facebook page, and i message him, and wait......and wait......

i finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  i express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  i go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  she tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

fast forward a couple of weeks.  i get a message on facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  she explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and molds in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  she sent pictures, and i confirmed that yes - those are our rings!  she said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

i open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  of our rings.  she went ahead and had her brother, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  i asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and i was allowed to keep my old one.  she told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  i asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

our ""new"" wedding bands will be here thursday.

trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has no idea any of this took place.

\*edit - i rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her i was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  the absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to not tell her as we tell each other everything.  so now i not only need to figure out how to do this, but not to spill the beans until then.  (our friends nicknamed us mickey and mallory as well as marshall and lilly from ""how i met your mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*edit 2 - i thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where i actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (va nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so always goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when i originally proposed, i waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*edit 3 - and to those of you saying ""i"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  she is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  she is the reason i breathe, and supported all of us when i went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  she is my hero.  i wake up every day to earn her all over again.  this was one small thing i was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why i have a heartbeat.  and i don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if i seem sappy.  if a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

tl;dr wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, i went hardy boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

"update: my childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while i was sleeping. she told everyone and now he's being ostracized from our friends. except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place nsfw. link to original(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cxr0sp/my_childhood_friend_went_through_my_boyfriends/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

#that ""half blurred nude"" everyone's talking about is rick astley. please, go ahead and ""depixelize"" it or whatever. 

#the other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. please read the post before commenting.

so a couple things have happened in the last few days, and i figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

first, i'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. he is just as much a victim of a crime as i am, if not more. this has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. he is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

it's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

i spoke to a lawyer...and my dad. the lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **if** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

anyways. monday, i got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. the first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". she would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

in my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. it also matters that there are two victims.

the police spoke to the people whose names i provided, most of which confirmed that sarah had shared the photos. they'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

that all made both me and john happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(all of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

so i turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. i spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. then i paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""under construction"". then i registered john and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""content pending copyrights"".

then. i posted on facebook.

""recently, someone i consider a friend broke into john's phone and stole images. she then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

not only am i disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed john in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. this person did not come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

had i actually been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. how horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

in actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

most of you know me as an entrepreneur; i own a small business, i pick up freelance jobs, i dabble in several money making ventures. none of this is a consistent income, so john and i have been brainstorming on how i could possibly generate a passive income. 

so we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. we had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and john's name was dragged through the dirt.

shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

because of this person and all who participated, i have had to out john and myself as sex workers. i've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn dad. shame on all of you.

from this point on, any person sharing these copyrighted images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

if anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

thank you.""

since then, i've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on facebook.

sarah tried to call but i hit ignore and texted her, ""you may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. she hasn't responded.

all in all, i'd say that things are looking up. sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. john's name is clear legally. important people in my life know that i'm not being abused. 

people are reaching out to john to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

so that's good, i guess.

i want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

edit: to everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

i submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. i wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

i was, an still am, angry. so i got shit done.

*edit edit*: **i am not releasing the videos.**

**another edit**: since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, this is where i got my information(https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#final edit:

this is getting out of hand so i'll be logging off. people asked for an update, so they got it.

copied from a comment i posted:

nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting sarah arrested.

my lawyer told me that, no, john could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, i could go ahead and post on facebook to try to control the narrative. 

he *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. as of now, i've achieved everything i wished to do. the police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

i don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",8
"update: my (21) little sister (12) was given 1-3 weeks to live. what can i do to make her enjoy her last days?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5idc1/my_21_little_sister_12_was_just_given_13_weeks_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

final update:

i first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. i got a lot more responses than i had thought i would, so i apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

my sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on september 1st. it's been a very hard couple of days and i've been grieving, as has my family. 

we were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. i was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. she was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

i wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. she normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. we will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

my family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. she will always be in our hearts and i know she's in a better place and not in pain. 

thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice i was given.",8
"my (20f) boyfriend (21m) wouldn't pay for my meal when i forgot my wallet. basically the title. 

usually on dates, we split the bill. i don't really care like in the past, i've paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. like we'd go back and forth. 

my current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. from the first date, he said that's how he likes to do things. i was fine with it, i didn't  really care if he wouldn't pay for me. paying on a date is sweet to me and i like it but i have my own job so it's whatever. i figured maybe he doesn't have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

anyway i didn't really have any problem with it. but we went out to some random spot. like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. so he went down the line and he got his own meal. i ordered mine and then when i went into my bag, i realized i forgot my wallet at my house. i told him that i forgot it by accident and i thought he'd offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like ""oh that sucks..."" and sat down to eat. 

i was just like what the fuck..? this guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and i paid him back through cashapp. after we ate, i lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city. 

how messed up is that? like why is he so cheap. a random stranger paid for me and he wouldn't",8
"update: i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone.. it's been a long night. thank you all for staying patient. also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

first off i just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. i'm still trying to work through all of your pm's because i'd like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. i have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. i never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it's my hope that if i can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice i used from reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon cp and find this thread (at least in canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

i also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, i understand. this is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as i wish i had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary karma, i don't. to provide proof i have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what i have written.

yesterday i was picked up by my best friend alex around 2:30. we drove around and talked for a while. i went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. we drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. david was home, in my room, and immediately i noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. he said he had to admit something to me. i prepared for him to admit to possessing cp but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn't know how to bring it up. i feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. he  said no. i asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. i don't know why i was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the cp but i really thought he'd admit to it then and there. instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn't think he would act on it. he asked me if that changed my perception of him and i said no. he grew quiet again and i left to go shower. when i came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. it was about 1030 at this point. when he left, i finally lost it and broke down. i grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. i was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

i grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency rcmp line for my city. shaking and crying i explained to the lady on the phone that i had discovered cp on my boyfriend's phone. she put me through to the report line and i spoke to another constable who told me i would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. i waited for around 10 minutes. the officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. i asked if i could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, crown counsel has clear evidence that i was not coerced into stating what i witnessed. i don't have my full licence yet and because of the late time i wasn't able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if david was there and if i could safely leave without arousing suspicion. luckily david knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so i made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. david didn't seem to question it and i waited for the officer to arrive. 

he called me from a blocked number and i walked outside and down the block to his suv. the constable and another officer greeted me,  i got into the front seat and we drove to the station. during the ride i asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. he explained that i had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying david. he said if i had taken david's phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. it was about 11:15 at this point. they placed me in an interview room and i sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. the officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. he said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 he started off by asking me details about my life, where i grew up, past employment etc. after that portion he asked me about david, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else i knew about him. i told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we'd been together but i did express that things had been moving very quickly. he agreed. he then got me to explain how i came upon the photos in question, so i did. then came the worst part. he asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos i explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. it was intense but by some grace of god i was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and i was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. he asked me if i would testify in court and i said i would. the officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. the full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

after i had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. they explained how the process would go and whether i wanted a no contact agreement.  i said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. that made sense to me so i chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

we got in the constable's car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. i told them i was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (i didn't want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. i've never felt so anxious in my life. i asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. about 15 minutes later i saw them bringing david out in handcuffs. my heart which had been dissolving in my stomach's acid all day felt completely gone. i curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told i could go back inside. after another eternity (my phone had died by this point but i know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. i was told by the officer i could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. the officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that i did a brave thing and to be well. 

i went back into my house, put planet earth on for background noise and called my other best friend paige who had been keeping up with me about this since i sent her my reddit post. we were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. it was david. he was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. my jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and i was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. paige asked me if everything was okay and i told her david had walked through the door, i would call her back. immediately david came to the bed where i was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. he said he didn't know i would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. he asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. i lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. he sobbed more and loudly said ""that isn't me, that isn't me, this isn't who i am"" and cried more and more. his body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. it was immensely difficult to witness and i wish i could have told him to get the fuck out but i just sat there immobilized, in shock. it was well close to 5 in the morning and i hadn't slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

david began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. i asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. he said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. i asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. he said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. i nodded. i asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. he admitted they were very explicit photos and i asked how he even found them; i don't recall we ever got to that. he promised me he didn't use my internet to access it but i don't really believe that. he apologized to me more times than i could count and asked if i hated him. i told him i wasn't sure that i felt hatred for him but i was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; i told him how terribly i felt betrayed and hurt and violated. i expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

then i heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. three officers were outside, two of whom i recognized from earlier and they asked me if david was here. i said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because paige had called in. i realized i had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know i was okay, bless her heart. the officers took david outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. i told them i was okay; that i would finish my discussion with him and if i had any issues i had them on speed dial. they nodded and left. 

david sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and i just sat and well, endured it. tears just ran and ran and ran from him. he said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure i expected to hear this great big apology. he said if i thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he'd done, but what i had to go through. i just nodded. there was silence for a long time, i think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. i don't know how long i stared at my tv screen that said ""are you still watching: planet earth?"" but it could have been a lifetime. i had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. i think david was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. i didn't know or care, i was just numb. i would have probably sat like that until i died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. i got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. my brain wasn't capable of thought so i stared at my tv screen until i passed out sometime around 9. 

i didn't sleep for long because when i woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. david was awake and crying still. when he realized i was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. i just stared at him. he started apologizing and apologizing more. he expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that i was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. he expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. i shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. at this point i finally asked him to leave. i told him i needed space to sort out my emotions, and i needed to get some sleep.  i asked him if he would be okay. he nodded and grabbed his things. he said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that's what i wanted him to do. i said nothing. he expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. he said i love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

i've been laying in bed since then and writing this. i just want this to be over. i just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. also i think i forgot to add that his court date is set for june. as far as sentencing, if he's found guilty of possession of child pornography i believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  i will post updates again if i feel  they are important; otherwise i will update again in june when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. i have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and i would have been so lost without some of your advice. i'll continue working on replying to your pm's, but in the meantime i think i'm going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

tldr: filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested david and seized his phone. he signed a promise to appear in court in june. he awaits sentencing.

"wife told me she wanted to experiment, i obliged, then she attempted to eat my feces.. throwaway account because my wife follows my regular account here. my (28m) wife (26f) and i have admittedly had very vanilla sex throughout our 3 year marriage. we had our first kid a year ago and it seriously slowed down our sex life. however, a little under a month ago she approached me about ""trying new things"". she has been hanging out with a group of moms in our neighborhood and one of them told her that she and her husband tried pegging and it completely transformed their marriage. my wife told me that she wanted to try pegging as well to ""spice things up"". at first i thought it was a joke, but soon realized she actually wanted to peg me. i had never done assplay before and had always lived by the philosophy that the anus is solely an exit, but my wife made it clear that this was important to her so after a few days i obliged.

that next weekend, she pegged me and everything was surprisingly enjoyable. additionally, the week following the pegging was one of the best weeks we've had together since the birth of our child. we were back to our old sex life, doing things like having sex before work and even waking each other up with head. however, that next weekend she told me she wanted to peg me again. i was slightly confused as to why this last week of sex wasn't cutting it for her, but i agreed.

this is when things took an extreme turn. during this second pegging while my wife was inside of me, she grabbed my hair, craned my neck to the right, and pressed our foreheads together. i had never seen her take control like this and thought it was very hot until she looked me in the eye and whispered ""i want your shit"". i pulled my face away and asked her to repeat and she said ""i want you to shit on me"". i pushed her off of me and asked her if she was joking and she started crying. i felt like a fucking dick because she thought i was kinkshaming her. in a way, i was because i thought the request was far too extreme. i ended up leaving for the night and stayed with one of my close friends, but didn't tell him what happened.

after that incident, my wife and i hardly talked all week unless it related to our son. at the end of the week, i asked my wife to talk about what happened. she told me again that she wanted me to shit on her and that it meant a lot to her. i thought it was sickening, but she claimed this was her deepest, darkest kink. i couldn't understand how and why my shit excited her, but she insisted that she has always wanted this.

we fought about this for about a week and after watching some scat porn and reading articles by people who also shared this kink, i tried to put myself in my wife's shoes. i told her that i will shit on her if that is what will turn her on. she was so happy and even though i was still completely nauseated by this desire, i wanted to satisfy her.

that brings us to tonight. we were having sex for the first time this week when i (regrettably) confessed to her that i had to take a shit. she perked up with a smile, sensed my discomfort, and began stroking my hair and whispering encouraging things to me. i still really didn't want to go through with it, but since i had promised her i pulled out and we ran to the bathroom.

she got into the bathtub and i hung my ass over the side of the tub. i started pushing, but unsurprisingly found it very difficult to successfully shit on my wife. i turned my head around to see my wife staring up and smiling at me waiting for me to finish. with enough time, i was finally able to get a turd to start coming out. i could hear my wife breathing heavier beneath me as my asshole started opening. however, before the turd was able to drop on her chest, i felt a sensation around my asshole.

i turned around and saw my wife - the love of my life, the mother of my son - attempting to catch my turd in her mouth as it fell out of my asshole. i was horrified that she would try to do this, and tried to pull the shit back into my body so she couldn't receive it in her mouth. seeing what looked like an attempt by her to eat my shit brought me close to throwing up.

as i clenched my buttcheeks together to try to stop the shit from reaching my wife, the clenching cut off a very small piece of my shit and i heard it land somewhere beneath me. i was too scared and disgusted to look at my wife to see what she had done with it, so i ran to the other bathroom to clean myself. as i was sitting in the other bathroom thinking about how i will ever be able to look my wife in the eye again, i heard footsteps approaching. my wife lightly knocked on the door. i didn't respond and was on the verge of throwing up the more i thought about what just happened. she walked away and then i got a text from her thanking me for fulfilling her wish and asking me to come to bed.

i've been sitting in the living room typing this for the last half hour scared to face my wife. we have plans to take our son to the zoo with another family tomorrow, but i don't think i can look at her after what she did to me. i feel deceived and violated by the woman i love and trust. during our initial conversations about this, there was never a question that my shit would go anywhere other than her chest. she knew how uncomfortable i was with this in the first place, yet she still tried to push the boundary that we had established.

i would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a similar violation of trust from a loved one. i'm turning to this sub for advice because for obvious reasons, i cannot tell anyone that knows my wife and i. i know that some of you may find this humorous, but please serious comments only - this is something that could lead to the end of our marriage.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: i didn't expect this to go to the front page, but my wife has seen the post. i have been unable to face her and there is no way to get out of going to the zoo with the other family today.  i appreciate all the serious feedback and i will update tonight.",8
"i think i got reverse catfished last night. i matched with this girl on tinder. she was significantly bigger than girls i normally date. but we have literally everything thing in common so i figured i'd give it a shot. so after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

i get there and pick a table. after waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. that's very strange so i assume she must be after something. free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, i don't know.

so i explain to her that i'm actually waiting for someone and i don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

that's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one i'm waiting for. she told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

and she was also testing me to see if i would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. so here's the thing, i don't know how i feel about being ""tested"". i don't want to live my life questioning every decision i make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

but she's also really attractive and very cool otherwise. i'm not sure how i should proceed.

edit: i didn't expect this to be downvoted so much. i guess people just prefer the standard ""i just walked in on my fiance and my father, brother, and best friend all had their penis' inside her at the same time. should i still go through with the wedding?""",8

i wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love i received from people in this sub i feel like the least i can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. before i begin i just want to thank everyone who gave advice, i didn't respond to everyone but i read almost every response. i stopped reading my pm's because a lot of the messages i was getting were graphic and negative but i appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and i'm sorry if i didn't respond to you. now on to the update: 

it's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. my bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time i decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. i felt like everything i needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. his sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

we spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. he told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while i was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when i first suggested it. he said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (i don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when i brought up his tattoo. obviously i knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but i must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because i never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

i was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. he regrets the tattoo and discovering i wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. he apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. he completely understood where i was coming from when i brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

i apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what i meant and was very forgiving. he apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

we then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

up until now i was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. apparently she felt like i was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

if that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. we're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

my bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. she was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. we've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

in the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. in the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. i'm a fan of this idea as well. 

as for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. i don't think he should, i feel like he's lost enough family but i'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

i think that just about wraps everything up. a huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

i mean this in the nicest way possible when i say i hope i never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - we both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. we're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",8
"my wife (30f) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. i (30m) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. our relationship is not sustainable and i need help.. hi, everyone. this will probably be lengthy as i have nobody in my life to talk to about this. this is as much an advice thread as it is a place for me vent and it feels good to air this out.

my wife suffers from intense germophobia and anxiety. we have been together for 11 years and married for 8. she has not always been like this, she was relatively normal while we dated but it started to get worse after we got married. she previously worked at a hotel as a receptionist and was occasionally required to handle and wash guest towels. well, she ended up contracting a staph infection and had to be hospitalized to have the infection drained. following this, she had to be on antibiotics for 30 days. ever since that experience, her anxiety and fear of infection has steadily grown over the years up until this point. we also have two children - 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl - and her tendencies affect them, also.

the following list is my attempt at a comprehensive germ-prevention ""standard operating procedures"" of our household:

&#x200b;

* if i touch a light switch i need to wash my hands
* if i touch a door knob i need to wash my hands
* if i go to the garage i need to take a shower before i      can sit down or do anything
* if i touch her pajamas or i touch towels then i need to      take a shower
* if i *even enter* the guest bathroom then i have      to take a shower
* if my kids enter the guest bathroom they have to have a      bath
* i am not allowed to use her toilet in the master      bathroom
* she stops up her toilet everyday and requires me to      plunge and clean it (she uses 3x as much tp as a regular person would).      the cleaning process is 3 chlorox wipes - one for the seat, one for under,      and one to use to flush it with. i have to immediately shower after this.
* if she spills excess *water* on the floor then i      have to mop it and anywhere i walked to include the **entire** house if      that is where i walked after stepping in the water.
* she goes through entire loads of her pajamas daily just      trying to change her clothes. every time she uses the toilet, she has to      change her clothes. she washes her hands and arms up to her elbows and      then her face. if she gets water on her shirt, she will change it. if,      when putting on her shirt she touches it to her body, she will change it.      if her pants touch the floor when she is putting them on, she will change      them. she discards the top shirts in her drawer every time she gets      dressed. she uses 6-7 towels after a shower, discarding half of them      because ""they touched my chest."" as you can see, this adds up      and i end up folding laundry for 60-90 minutes everyday. this doesnt      include the time it takes to actually change it out and take showers.
* if i change out laundry and **i graze the doorframe** when i enter the bedroom with clothes, i have to discard all of them.
* if an article of clothing touches the edge of the bed, discard it.
* if i even *touch* the dishwasher i have to wash my      hands.
* if she takes a shower and gets in the bed, she will not      leave the bedroom or she considers herself dirty and would have to shower      again. this means if she is hungry or thirsty i will bring it to her.
* her showers last around 40 minutes. she bathes 3-4      times and washes her hair 2 times. our water bill is ridiculous.
* if my son (2 yo) takes one step outside of his playpen      then he has to have a bath before he can go in his bed. this includes      naps. if i take him outside (even just for *1 minutes*), he would      need a bath before he can get in his bed. not even changing his clothes      would suffice.
* when i clean the house (which i dont mind, btw.      cleaning your house is necessary), everything has to be done in a **very      specific order**. no deviations from this order or it has to be re done.

&#x200b;

1. change out laundry and leave washer free
2. wash hands, face, and arms and change clothes
3. sanitize all toys on floor and put away
4. pick up all clothes and put in baskets
5. sanitize all counters
6. clean kids bathroom
7. take out master bathroom trash, wash hands, replace bag
8. take out kids trash, wash hands, replace bag
9. take out kitchen trash, wash hands, replace bag
10. clean guest bathroom, wash hands, take out trash, wash      hands, replace bag
11. take shower
12. put bathroom rugs in washer
13. take shower
14. sweep entire house in a very specific order
15. mop house in very specific order
16. take shower

i want to make this clear - i have no problem with cleaning but i often do something in the wrong order or forget to wash my hands and i get berated. my wife has little patience for mistakes that involve germs. often, i have to clean the house late at night after the kids go to bed so i will be doing it after midnight. of course i will make mistakes when i am mentally exhausted.

&#x200b;

* if i bring her water, i have to wash my hands and then *hold      the cup over my head* as it clears the kitchen counter. she thinks that      if i hold her cup around my chest that it will touch the counter and be      dirty. i do the same thing with plates and utensils.
* if i have to discard a piece of clothing on the floor      in her vicinity, she will change her clothes and get pissed. she thinks      that the **air created when the clothing hits the floor will blow      bacteria all over her**. this is perhaps the one that triggers me the      most.
* if my dog gets out, he has to have a bath before he can      come back. he gets out often because she wont close the door.
* my wife **will not touch doorknobs**. she uses her      foot to close the door and she will just fucking leave it open over      actually closing it - even when she leaves the house.
* if i leave the house with my phone, i cannot bring it      back into the house until i sanitize it. that includes washing the phone      case with soap and water and then using alcohol on the phone.
* no shoes on the in house, ever. i had contractors over      a month ago and they wore shoes. i had to sanitize every object they      touched, and mop twice where they walked.
* her depth perception is abysmal. we get in so many      fights because she thinks that i touched her with a dirty object when i      was *halfway across the room.* when she gets dressed, i half to watch      her and verify that she doesnt touch her body with the outside of the      shirt. same with pants.
* we never have people over because of her fear of      infection. plus, i am the one who has to clean and sanitize so i am      reluctant to even mention hosting an event or having a party at the house.

there is more things i have to deal with but i cannot remember every situation right now. the worst of it for me is the constant laundry (3-4 loads a day - sometimes more) and showers (4-5 showers a day). i have taken as many as **9** showers in one day and as many as **35** showers in one week. i wash my hands over 50 times a day. i have gotten to the point where i just pretend to take a shower or wash my hands if she isnt in the room. i fantasize about just being able to get through my day not feeling like a puppet on a string. i get no sleep (maybe 4-5 hours on average) and have almost no free time. and this is not because of my kids.

you may be thinking, ""dude, go to marriage counseling."" we did that about two months ago. my dad may be the only person who really knows what i am going through he told me to be completely honest - hold nothing back. that is exactly what i did. i told the counselor everything that i just revealed to all of you. i have had this talk with my wife already but she says, ""you can leave at anytime, if you cant handle it you dont have to be here."" the counselor was speechless for a second but then began to address my wife and asking her if it was all true. my wife just shutdown and barely refused to acknowledge it. after the session, my wife got upset at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" and canceled all future sessions.

i want to say one last thing. before she went deep into this fear of infection, we had a great relationship. we loved each other and felt we were meant to be. i still love her and want it to work. i have been dealing with the worst of this for nearly 3 years now. i am physically and mentally exhausted. i have thought of leaving multiple times but i am afraid of how it will affect my kids. we also bought a huge house and invested sums of money into it that we would lose. my wife refuses to take medication for her anxiety (i dont blame her, most of it hasnt worked in the past).

has anyone ever been in situation similar to this? thank you for taking the time to read and i appreciate any and all advice.

**tl;dr** \- my wife suffers from extreme germophobia and it severely complicates my life and my childrens' lives.

&#x200b;

edit:  i want to make something clear.  my children take 1 bath a day (sometimes two).  they dont do what i do - that is the one thing i absolutely fucking put my foot down on.  but yeah, they need out of this situation asap.  i talked to my wife a few minutes ago and let her know exactly how i feel - again.  she broke down, as expected, and ended our conversation.  when i get home we will continue to address this.

"i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.. update here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d68r0f/update_im_out_600_after_my29m_best_friend31m_and/)

&#x200b;

groom and i had been friends since middle school and best friends since high school. i'm one of the only people he talks to about his emotions, which is particularly important because i've been his go-to for advice, especially in relationships. in fact, since knowing him, i've talked him through each of his break ups. we've mutually called each other brothers, he helped me move, i helped him plan and throw his mom's birthday party. i'm close with his family, his mom actively asks about me. i've also been close to each of his significant others, save for his now wife.

a month after his engagement, groomsman invitational boxes went out. we have a very tight knit group of friends that have been together since high school, supplemented by college and work friends. of the original high school group, i was the only one not asked to be a groomsman. this obviously stung, but i maintained a jovial demeanor towards everyone while acid flowed in my veins. it triggered my depression for a solid month where i questioned so much (do any of my friends even care about me? am i not groomsman material? is it because they thought i was too fat?) until the groom and i had a talk.

he said it was a very hard decision choosing groomsmen, which i'm sure it was. he told me that i was in the original roster of groomsmen (only 6 out of 7 had received invitations) but that the bride would not sign off on my involvement. apparently, i had said something off-color about their relationship as it was beginning and she held it against me ever since. she'd apparently never brought it up until now, years later, and never gave me any indication of being uncomfortable with me (her family even loves me). i'm generally a very positive, well-received person, so this was news to me. he said it was tearing him up inside, and i believed him at the time, and he asked me to try and talk to her, see if we could make amends. he said that he'd let her know that i knew about how she felt towards me and that i'd be reaching out to talk about it. so i messaged the bride through text and dm, saying (paraphrased), ""hey! i'm so sorry if anything i've said has upset you. can we meet sometime and talk? i'd love to clear it up, or hear your side at least."" the bride leaves me on read, and a month later, the final groomsmen invitation box goes out to another friend.

fast forward to a few weeks ago, the bride, groom, and i are hanging out. groom and i are talking, and i'd since been able to process the reality of not being involved in my best friends wedding, so i ask how he's doing, and how all the prep is going. the conversation leads us here...

groom: hey man, i wanted to know if you could help me out with something?

me: sure. what's up?

groom: i was wondering if you would want to usher for me? it's no big deal if you can't, but i want you to be there for me if you can, you know? like, be a part of the wedding.""

me (very touched): yeah! of course i can, dude. anything for you two.

groom: thank you so much. you know, we also have the rehearsal dinner next week. i know it's late notice, but if you can make it...

me: i'll have to see if i can leave work early, but i'm already there, man. thanks for thinking of me!

a week goes by with no updates or details on ushering or the rehearsal dinner, so i shoot him a text saying, ""hey man! big day's this weekend. just wanted to reach out and see if you still needed help with ushering, or if you'd still like me at the dinner. i got the time off with my boss, so i can definitely make it. just let me know."" he returns my text a few hours later with a call saying (paraphrased), ""yeah man, we would still like you to usher. i'll text you details later today, but we actually don't need any help at the rehearsal dinner, we kind of want it to just be the bridal party and stuff, but yeah. thanks for helping us out!"" i'm a little put out, but i persevere. at least he asked me to be an usher. that's something, right?

morning of the wedding comes around and i'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time i should show up to the reception to start helping. then bride messages me asking for a favor. these messages were juxtaposed perfectly against the unanswered messages i had previously sent the bride to olive-branch our relationship. bride says they forgot about the appetizers & need someone to pick them up. can i do this for a bride, on her wedding day? sure. oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. **sure.**

at this point i should have stopped and asked myself, ""why am i helping so much? why didn't i ask for their money up front? should being a good friend really cost you so much emotionally, physically, or monetarily?"" hindsight. 20/20. with the ceremony ended, my group of friends who weren't in the wedding party spend the hour and a half before the reception pre-gaming while i go pick up the appetizers. thank god i played as much tetris as i have, because fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. i text the bride to let her know we've got everything together and i'd see them at the reception. once again, left on read.

i get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in. i find no leadership at the venue, no planners, no family who weren't already seated at their tables and otherwise willing to help the newlyweds get things ready. the venue does have staff, but they are all preoccupied with in-venue needs. so i have to carry all the appetizers inside by myself.

since guests were already seating themselves, i immediately moved from placing the last appetizer box in the back to working usher duties at the front. it was a fucking mess. at one point, i was so down about the situation that i literally googled, ""is it an insult if someone asks you to usher their wedding?"" to start, the place cards were in no discernible order. they were also written in intricate cursive that was sometimes unclear. i should mention, too, that because of the cultural heritages of our newlyweds, we had some very interesting, hard to spell, and sure as shit hard-to-read-in-cursive names. we weren't given a table map, or a master list, or any direction at all. the best part is, i say ""we"" because at this point i met my ushering-peers; they were the grooms youngest adult cousins, aged 18 and 19 (i'm 29), and they were really good at finding names and seating people. when i asked why they were so good, they said, ""they always make us do this because no one else wants to. we did this at the wedding last year.""

after finding out that, to the groom, i was about as equal as the lowest-rung of his family, my group of not-in-the-wedding-party friends shows up. they ask me to stay for a drink, but i can't because i'm still ushering. as i step back behind the name card table, i take a look out the door to my left and see the groomsmen laughing and taking a selfie. to my right, i see all of my other friends at a table without me, taking a shot. i look down at the random, nonsensically ordered name cards and i wonder, how did i get here?

wedding kicks off & in the rare instance i can speak to bride & groom they don't say thank you or bring up the money. i also don't talk money because it's their fucking wedding reception, but what should i do, pluck $500 from her wedding dress during the money dance?  i'm sure it's true of other weddings, but it seems like the bride and groom don't really engage or reply when i walk up to them with my hugs and congratulations. i can understand this. maybe they're burned out. maybe they're trying to hold back things from boiling to the surface.

now the last song is playing, and the lights are on, and everyone's getting ready to go home and the groom approaches me.

groom: hey, thanks again for your help. i was wondering if i could borrow you again?

me: what's up?

groom: did you drive here? we have stuff we need to get back to the hotel... it could really help us out.

me: ... how far is the hotel?

groom: 10 minutes away.

me (for a groom, my best friend, on his wedding day: .... sure.

get to hotel, unpack everything, it's 12:30am, i'm hungry. groom says to stick around, we'll hang out, drink more. he goes to get changed, i say i'm gonna grab food & come back. groom asks for food for he & bride. i say sure. bride's cousin overhears & asks me to buy her food too. sure. then she asks the room at large who'd like food. now i'm buying food for almost the whole after party. cousin says she'll venmo me when i get back, & she'll pay for everyone elses stuff. **sure.**

come back, cousin is passed out. drunken guests grab whatever food they see. groom walks up to me, burger in hand, & says he's actually really tired so he's gonna go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. i grab my food, take the elevator to the first floor hotel cafeteria, & eat alone, upset, in silence. at this point, i'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late night food run, and am pretty sure that i never really had a best friend to begin with. i feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous. i went from, ""being a groomsmen,"" to being a guest, to being an usher, to being an unpaid wedding coordinator. this was the first wedding in my close knit friends circle and it turned out nothing like how i thought it would. i've never worked so hard for such little gratitude and i'm left wondering how i could have been such a chump, and how many other times i'd been taken advantage of for being helpful.

the advice i'm hoping for is, how can i go about expressing how terrible a time i had at his wedding without insulting him, if i should do that at all, how can i develop myself to not be put in situations like this, and when would it be appropriate to ask for the appetizer money back? also, i feel like the missing puzzle piece is the bride's side of the story, but she still hasn't given me any indication of what i did to her. i know she read my texts about wanting to clear the air, she had to have when she asked me to get the appetizers. how can i start a dialogue with her and sort this out if she won't even acknowledge it? should i just step away from this relationship all together (after getting back my money)?

&#x200b;

tl;dr ""best friend"" couldn't make me groomsmen cause of now-wife, who had no problem asking huge favors of me on the day of the wedding, little to no thanks, out $$$, ended up doing the most out of whole friend group (groomsmen / bridesmaids included), ended the night feeling defeated and losing even more money.

&#x200b;

update: wow. thank you for your overwhelming response to this. i want to thank everyone who took the time to share with me, be it positive or negative. i really feel like i need to hear it all before i make a next move, and i'm especially grateful for those of you who have extended friendship to me and those of you have been very critical of me. i'll take it all. i just want to become better than i am now. i'm legitimately reading through everything and, after work, i'll post a fleshed out update.",8
"should i (48m) tell my wife (44f) that i received a sex tape of her in the mail?. throwaway.

this is an odd thing. wife and i have been married 20 years. i've never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

first of the year, i receive a package in the mail. it's a dvd addressed to me, and a typed note that says ""your eyes only"". it's my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. she was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

first i've no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the dvd - none of which i know. i'm assuming it's one of my wife's ex. second i've know idea why they sent it. are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? the tape isn't time stamped so i don't have a frame of reference. she kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

and also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? i know my wife had other partners. hell i had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago i think we're past that. but apparently this person or persons isn't.

the whole thing is strange. i'm not sure what's going on. i haven't told my wife, i'm not sure how she would take it. she's very sexual and adventurous but i don't think she'd like the idea of her past catching up to her. but i don't think i'll get to the bottom of this unless i tell her.

edit - update. i'm overwhelmed by the responses. thank you for your interest.

i did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. some mentioned letting her watch it in private and i gave her that option. she did and we talked at length. some of it is a bit clearer now.

the two ""amateur"" looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. that's why the camera doesn't move and that's why the room is the same.  i asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

the other is a boyfriend she dated when her and i met, before we actually started dating. she knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it's him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

why?

she admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on facebook. when she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. she thinks he sent the dvd to cause an issue with us.

for the first time i now have doubts. her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. and honestly i may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - i know it was 20 years ago but that's still hard to take call me shallow if you want. also she didn't seem shaken by the dvd or the fact i had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. i had the idea she'd rather i didn't have it but now that i did, oh well. 

it still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the dvd was made in 2013 but i'm just getting it now? that many be minor but it may be everything. plus how does this gentleman know where i live - facebook doesn't give you that information. being in contact with someone does so now you see why i have doubts.

thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. i love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it's slapping us in the face right now. i will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

edit ii - i want to clarify something. i've been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that i'm upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. none of my business, it was 20 years ago i should man up, that sort of thing.

look, i said it was hard to take. most men understand their partner was with different people before them. but seeing their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. i didn't say i was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. it's just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. i'll get past it , but it's not an easy thing. and for everyone who says ""it was 20 years ago lighten up"" i challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. frustrated at best. you won't love her less but you'll not feel great afterwards trust me. so thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position i'll ignore you thank you very much .

final edit - this will be my final edit. thank you all for your support but all i will say is, it's time for me to make some decisions. i hacked into my wife's facebook account - childish and immature i'll admit but i did it nonetheless. and i found things disturbing enough that i need to think long and hard about what i do next. i've given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and i'm questioning her more than ever before. heartbroken is putting it mildly. it's time for me to work on my life and my self. thanks to everyone and their interest .",8
"update i (28m) think my girlfriend (26f) of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love.. link to previous post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aejrnr/i_28m_think_my_girlfriend_26f_of_four_years_is/?st=jqrwkq4d&sh=e1753ed8)

as soon as she opened the door to our apartment, i could tell that she was already starting to cry. seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because i didn't want to put her in that position. 

i had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. 

we sat down, there were lots of tears. i thought i would be bitter, angry and that i would be screaming at her the whole time but i felt disappointed instead. 

i told her that i saw the messages and explained how i ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. 

she kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn't know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.

then i told her that we go more way back than they ever did. i was there through her lowest point, i helped her get up.

she admitted that they had sex more than three times. 

i saw it coming, i had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. at that point, i was full on crying. i can't remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. it still is now. 

i remember telling her that i was done, that whatever we had was over. she kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, i don't think i ever will. i can't tolerate people who cheat.

by that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. 

obviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. 

when i posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. his place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. he'll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that i can't bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.

we both agreed that i don't mention him in this post. i'm glad that i really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. 

it's almost 3am, i'm heartbroken as ever but i'm trying my best. i'm sending my resignation letter to work this morning. every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. i'll be flying home as soon as possible. 

to all my aussie mates,  if you live near/around chapel hill, let me know! 

america, you were great but now it's time to come home. thanks for the help everyone.

edit: i'm crying again, not because i got cheated on but because i realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. i almost can't believe i looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. i am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.

anthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. 

i may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but i gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. 

other than that, i am feeling better. it still feels surreal that she's gone but what can a bloke do? she made her choice so i made mine. 

i woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that i shouldn't rush things and that she's stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. 

it sucks that i may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. i thanked them and said that although i believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. 

ex also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so i junked it straight away. 

i miss her like crazy. i know it will take a lot of time to heal me but i guess i can wait. 

ps. i'll message my newfound aussie friends when i go through all the comments. exact date of my flight hasn't been sorted out yet, but i'm hoping i'll be home by next month.

"my (19f) boyfriend (20m) broke up with me because i'm too good at sex. we've been dating for a year and he's a year older than me and we met in college. we took things slow bc we're both virgins and it's special to both of us so we agreed we'd wait until we're really in love and sure about each other. and after a year, we could see ourselves married in the future so we decided to have sex. 

even after our first time, he asked me if i really was a virgin or if i lied because i was too good. no i didn't lie. i just watched some educational videos and practiced on my own. since then, he'd get weird during sex. like if i did something good, he'd say it felt good and then his face would change like he was thinking. now i know he was questioning if i really was a virgin. 

anyway. he broke up with me yesterday after we had sex. tmi i was riding him and he said i act like a porn star and he's obviously not the only guy i've been with and he thinks i lied to him. i told him i watched a ton of porn and copy from the videos but he doesn't believe me. 

great. never thought i'd be dumped for being too good at sex. it just really sucks bc we had sex bc we thought we'd be long term and we broke up already. i want him back. i know he's just being paranoid. how do i tell him that i wasn't lying?

okay quick update: he texted me and said sorry so we're back together :)",8
"overheard my 26m fiance 24f tell her friend on the phone that she ""settled for being with me,"" and that marrying me was her ""last resort."". 

update 2: just did one of the hardest things i've ever had to do. today after breakfast i told her we should ""sit down and talk."" she was hesitant, but i said it was important. we went to the living room and she said to me ""i already know what this is about."" my post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under ""popular."" of course the water works started happening right away. i told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. through her tears, she said ""i was just joking, i wasn't serious."" she then went on saying stuff like ""i love you, i love you."" i told her i can't be in a marriage where my s/o doesn't love me the same way i love them. she tried to tell me that she loved me and that i meant something to her. but it was all bullshit. she said she ""didn't want to lose me."" i told her i don't think this marriage was the right decision. and from there i basically told her it was over. i told her i knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. for all those wondering, we have no kids, and i pay fully for the apartment we live in, and i own almost everything we have other then her clothes. i even pay for her car. so after all of this she'll have little to nothing left. before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, i've never been so happy with a decision i've made in my life. after that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me ""fuck you."" she started screaming at me, telling me ""you just can't end things like that."" i told her i could do whatever i wanted, and that's when she became very hostile. she screamed at me saying, ""you're the fucking worst relationship i've ever been in. you think i can't find someone again?"" ""do you think you'll ever from someone as good as me? you're a fucking idiot my name."" she grabbed her bag and phone, and said ""i'm leaving!"" before slamming the door behind her. at that moment i felt like i was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you'd find of tv. i sat down on the couch and cried, and i'm still crying as i type this up. it's both happy and sad tears, and i knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. she never loved me, it was obvious. our relationship only went one way, and i feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier i live in california, and i'm gonna start the process to annul our marriage. tomorrow, i'm gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that's essentially where they belong. (i'm not throwing out her stuff. just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. all of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and i know my life will certainly improve as a result.

edit/update: thanks everyone for the kind words! really has made me feel a lot better! going to be talking to her soon. also, i noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, i understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn't. i've been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. not really used to calling her my ""wife"" yet. also i used an old alt since she uses reddit. anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the internet can care so much about a person they don't even know. i'm going to talk to her today. i will be updating you all soon after.

edit: meant to put wife in the title but now i can't change it.

basically the title. i overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while i was passing the bedroom. this friend is in a serious relationship. my wife then said to her, ""sweetie, remember it's your choice. don't settle for just anyone. that's the mistake i made. who knows who else i could of had. my name was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up."" hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. does she even love me? why am i being treated as a second base? 

am i being dramatic and overreacting? i haven't said anything about it since. i honestly don't know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.",8
"update to: i found out i have a daughter who thinks i was her mother's rapist. it wasn't rape. what next?. ten days ago i requested advice and the post got removed after a day because i didn't use a throwra.  i'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. i alerted the moderators i would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

original

i received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a dna match and she is my biological daughter. it was a long and emotionally charged letter. she said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish i had caused her and her mother and grandparents. the letter was gut wrenching.

i was shocked but also skeptical. i have been married 25 years and i have three great kids. i have never raped or abused a woman ever! i thought this had to be a prank or scam. i had done home dna ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child i wasn't aware of. but when i logged into my account, there she was.

i did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, terry (fake name), i had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  we broke it off mutually and remained friendly. the very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. it was a casual hookup and i remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. also unprotected. afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. we both went home the next morning for summer break. terry didn't come back to college the next year, which i gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

one of the reasons terry and i were incompatible was religion. she was catholic and i'm jewish. i was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. my supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a jewish ex-boyfriend. but who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

it kills me that i have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. i can't imagine growing up thinking i was a product of rape. that has to be so hard psychologically. i am in pain for a child i didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

i have been debating what to do. i have not written back to my daughter. i badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). my wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. my best friend says i should hire a lawyer. i don't know what to do and it's eating me up. advice, please!

update

i hired a lawyer. he recommended that i respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. i wrote her a short message and described how and when terry and i met. i was careful not to attack terry and to offer sympathy. i explained that our sex was consensual. a week went by with no response.

two days ago my daughter wrote me and said terry now claims she was raped a month after she and i had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. she's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. i find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not i guess it gives terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

yesterday i spoke to my daughter for the first time. she was crying and so was i, so it wasn't easy to say much. before we hung up, i told her that i loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and i hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. she sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

my wife and i told our kids about a week ago. they are teenagers and took it really well. all three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. my wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. she has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. my daughter is going to call me again tonight and i'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. we have a lifetime of catching up to do.

meantime as for terry, i feel like my daughter and i were robbed, but i really don't want to dwell on it. she hasn't reached out to me and i don't plan to either, though i'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.


edit:  i'm overwhelmed by all the love coming at me from reddit. thank you all for your support, compliments and helpful opinions. really, really.
i promise i will post an update!
silver and gold! feels like i'm burl ives. thanks, kind strangers.",8
"update: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.. original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

i'll post the update first, since there has been some change since i last posted. then i'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of pms i received.

yesterday, i received a call from my gf. she was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. i told her that i still care for her, and that i'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

she told me that a few days after i told her we were done, she called up her mother to talk about this. apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that i was actually manipulating her to do so. her mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

after i left her, my gf called her mum up to talk about what went on. my gf said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. my gf said she broke down on the phone, and her mother kept asking her what she will do. the conversation then ended when my gf said she didn't know.

then she started texting. after a few hours of thinking, my gf sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. she was then blocked.

my gf then called me, and told me everything.

she will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

i discussed this with my gf, and we both completely agreed that i had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that i put my foot down, because had i not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (her words, not mine)

she further went on to say that i am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a mum, if she had me, she could get through this. i broke down at this point.

i love her so much. in truth, i probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though i knew i'd resent it. i made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if i had made the right decision.

i'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

also, screw any mother who places religion over their own child. friggin lunatics.


now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: no. my gf did not cheat on me. i am almost certain about this. not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. moreover, her roommate took photos of my gf after she came home assaulted. it's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: i don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my gfs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: my gf was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the mum).

4: thanks for all the people telling me i did the right thing. it was really difficult. i'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: to the people who pm'd me telling me i'm a monstrous baby killer - i fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

thanks reddit.",8
"my(39m) wife(40f) slapped our daughter (16f) after she came out as gay. i need help dealing with my wife and my daughter.. i'm actually an immigrant from mexico, so my english is average at best. 

i must admit that i was really homophobic and racist growing up. that was how i was raised. but when i moved to america, i met my wife and she helped me a lot. she helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. i owe that to my wife.

yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. so we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. it took some time to sink in, but i understood. when i asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. she asked me if i was fine with it and i told her that i had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. i must admit that i felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

after that, i asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. she told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. i'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. so i started to get ready to prepare it. 

at this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. and when i came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. my daughter was crying and i was really shocked. i asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. she told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

i asked my wife to leave, because i was really angry. after my wife left i told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and i'll stand by her. my daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

now, my wife refuses to talk to me. she told me that she will be back only if i agree to help my daughter become straight. idk what to make out of this. i'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. i love both of them very much and i'd like to help diffuse this situation. can i get some advice here?",8
"update: my (21m) girlfriend (21f) went on an anti semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. i'm jewish.... op: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc0gp4/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti_semitic/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app


i figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. this all happened a few days ago. 

the day i made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. well, that didn't turn out well. 

before i told her about my background, i asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards jews. she pretty much sounded like hans landa the whole time. at one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for ""teaming up"" with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible ""prank"" on a jewish student. 

afterwards i bluntly told her that i'm jewish. she didn't believe me at all and thought i was joking. i told her that i was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. this went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

when it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. things went 0-100 very fast. she got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. she said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. when she insulted me i reminded her that she really liked me despite my ""dirtiness"" which just pushed her over the edge. she cried hysterically and i left. 

the next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that she dumped me and not the other way around.  she warned me not tell people that i dumped her since that would make her look bad. i didn't say anything and closed the door. i heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare i close the door in her face and that ""you people are all the same"". after a while she left and started writing me on snapchat. i blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. i've never seen her act so crazy. 

long story short, i blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. i knew things wouldn't go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but i didn't know it would be this bad. some of her stuff is still at my place. oh well 


**tl;dr told her, broke up with her.**",8
"my (18f) best friend (18f) cheated on her boyfriend (21m), got pregnant and is lying that he's the dad. should i tell him?. ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. also i know this is pretty fucked up but natalie is a nice girl, she's my best friend. 

we graduated high school this summer so our friends and i all went on a small vacation to italy. we found a groupon thing online so it wasn't too expensive. natalie is dating eric but he didn't come on the trip with us. it was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. it's pretty well known among us friends that dylan who is in our high school, likes natalie. he's like really into her. well when we all went to europe, since eric wasn't there, natalie was all over dylan. acting like a couple, being all flirty. they'd sleep in the same bed but she'd insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. well, i shared a room with natalie and i walked in on them having sex. afterwards i asked her what she was doing since she was dating eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. it was not. we were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. dylan's dreams came true that week. but only i knew about it since it was our room. everyone else had their suspicions but i was the only one who really knew the truth. 

when we got back home, she promised me that she was just ""crazy"" since she was on vacation and she'd never cheat on eric again. she kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. so i promised to keep her little fling a secret. fucked up i know but i have more loyalty to natalie than eric. 

she continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she's now pregnant and i asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if i slapped her across the face. she said it's obviously eric and i reminded her about dylan and she insisted that eric is the father and to never mention dylan in front of her again. she's terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told eric and he told her not to worry and he'll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they'll be ok. she told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he's gonna be a good dad. he wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she's busy planning a quick wedding too. 

y'all. dylan is obviously the father. like 100%. they were fucking like rabbits in italy and i don't think she knew how to say ""where can i buy condoms"" in italian. i feel bad for eric since he's like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

i love natalie she's my best friend but this is so fucked up like i feel really bad for eric. i know she's scared and eric would obviously be the better dad but c'mon that's not his baby. dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. eric is older and he's graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. but it's not fair for him. i know she's trying to save her own ass but it's her fault for cheating on him.

i don't know like if i tell eric, natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby's life.",8
"my 33m fiancee 27f chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. how can i ever repay her?. two nights ago, my fiancee accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. the fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. i wasn't home, so i wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. if i was, i would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. it's just stuff. 

she chose differently. first, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. then she went back in. at this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. she knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

both of us have lost parents. i lost my dad 3 years ago. he was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before i actually met her. i have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom i have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. she lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

i don't even know how to begin to say thank you. i'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and i can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. i don't know how to repay her. or where to begin. can anybody think of a nice gesture i can make it up to her? she must be devastated. i can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad. 

tl;dr: my fiancee had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. how do i repay her?",8

the day after i posted originally, i told her i'm in love with her, and asked her on a ""real date"". it went well. really well, so easily and just good. and she slept next to me again that night.. i got to kiss her in public! she said it felt like our little family was right, and it really does, it feels like everything just sort of snapped into focus.

i am going to take everyone's advice and not just spring a marriage proposal on her out of nowhere, but i want to marry this girl and have more babies with her. because everything just makes sense now. 

and yes, she said she loves me too!!!!!!

"caught my girlfriend cheating and i cannot cope please help. so long story short i found texts on my(18m) gf(19) phone tonight texting her friend things like ""he pounded my shit"" ""i got some of the best dick last night"" and ""omg it was so good, i couldn't walk last night""

i'm disgusted.  it was her ex, whom i've always felt inferior too like she just hadn't gotten over him even after over a year.

i'm distraught.  i don't even have anyone else in my life rn.  my two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into uni and i have only really ""clicked"" with one guy friend.  my family and i don't even get along nor communicate much.  i lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

she's really sorry.  i saw her crying when she didn't know i could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  i feel bad but like the lying and deception isn't new.  i had to do it.  i told her we're over, but she's welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

but fuck this sucks.  i have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and i just don't know how to cope with this.  i can't eat.  i can't sleep and i have class in the morning.  i keep picturing the texts and visualizing him ""pounding"" her and i'm just disgusted.  i'm just obsessing over it and it's 4 am in the fucking morning.

part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  i know in a while i'll be ok but i just don't know how to get from part a to part b.

please help

on top of this awesome wave of support from all of you, i've had a few good things happen today that are just making this so much better:

-  my job app for a 20$ an hour job teaching sat prep was praised for ""outstanding qualifications""

-  i got invited to participate in drug research here at my school

- and my fucking package arrived that i've been waiting on for a week!

-also one of my friends who cut me off reached out to me

i'm doing well, thank you all, you're all a gift, much love from my corner of the internet, you're all worth a platinum in my eyes!

cheers!


edit3:  i can't believe i forgot to say, my exgf!

i did it guys :)

thanks for pushing me to stay strong on my boundary, y'all are the best",8
"update: i (21m) got my fwb (33f) pregnant and she's keeping it, i want to talk to her about other options.. this is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bhfi57/_/

well some time has passed.. and a lot has happened. my first post had a lot of comments and i got some pm's from people asking me what went down so that's why i'm updating.

so i didn't end up talking about abortion or anything like that because i realized it was pointless and rather insensitive. i didn't talk to her for 3 days, which she got a little upset about and i shouldn't have done that. but i needed some time to figure things out and think, because whatever i was going to decide would change my life so i needed some space, though i could have communicated a bit more (which i'm working on now).

anyways, i realized that i'm just straight up ridiculously in love with her and have been for a while. i was stuck on the age gap, i kinda blocked the word relationship in my mind when i thought of her. some comments really stuck with me and i decided to just trust my feelings. i ended up confessing my love for her when we finally met up and well lots of (happy) tears were shed. she was too scared to talk about her feelings because she knew how i felt about the age gap and she didn't want to make me uncomfortable or possibly mess up what we had. i'm very glad to say that she feels the same way. she completely lit up when i told her, i saw the joy and happiness in her eyes. she was ecstatic, i won't ever forget that. 

every minute we've spent with each other since has been amazing. i really do love this woman, there's just no way around it. we talked so much with each other the past couple of weeks and i don't understand how it has all been so amazing. i know we're probably still sort of in a honeymoon phase right now, but damn if she isn't the one.. i moved in with her almost 2 weeks ago, i had to do some adjusting at first but we worked through it. she has met my parents, that went surprisingly well actually. they got along really well, and they both told me that they could see why we were together and that we are a great fit. on top of that they both told me in private how much they like her, that has never happened with any girl i've introduced them to. the pregnancy came as a big shock however, and they needed some time to process it because well, they're going to be grandparents. i'm an only child so it's a pretty big deal, i'm really close with my parents. they are handling it right now, they asked a lot of questions and we answered them together. they fully support us now which does mean a lot to me.

she's in the last week of the first trimester now, and she's doing really well so far. i've been trying to help her and support her any way i can, and did a ton of reading online to understand what's going on. i offered to pause school for one year, but she insists we can make it work and that i can keep going. we need to work out the details but we got some time left for that.

so yeah... i'm going to a dad. she's gonna give birth to our kid.. still feels surreal to me, but i'm low-key kinda excited. it'll probably be very exhausting and hard at first but that's life. i'm happy that i'm doing this together with her. 

(any tips on how to support her during her pregnancy are welcome btw..)

edit: i don't need any pm's full of criticism, don't bother. just comment somewhere if you want to spit some nonsense",8
"wife (38f) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. it's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks i am going to abandon her and ""our twins"". this is all over the place. i really need help.

my wife and i (m42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

all this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. after some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

we were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. ofcourse i was super happy . 

a week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. the test came back negative and ofcourse i was devastated but she wasn't. she claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. we took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. my wife is in complete denial. now she claims we are having twins. she is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

i am at a loss and don't know what to do. my inaction is making her believe that i want to leave them and that i am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

what the f is even happening. i love her but i don't know what to do.

edit : forgott to add. i have tried talking her into therapy but she accuses me of gaslighting her

**little update/edit:** thank you guys you really helped me out. yesterday was a bad day and you helped me get clarity. i've had a chat with our doctor who will now be handling this with us. i would like to thank most of you with useful advice and hopefully i will be able to update good news someday. but a fuck you to those that said i should divorce her because she is ""crazy"" and an extra fuck you to the guy that used this post to push his anti abortion agenda.",8
"my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby. really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my gf was raped. it was done in a park. she didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. i couldn't force her, so i just stayed with her.

she was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and i've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. we went to therapy, and she knows i'm there for her. she has a history of depression, and i've been really worried.

last week, we found out she was pregnant. i was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. so the baby definitely isn't mine. she is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

so we had a discussion. she is a devout catholic. we initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

i flat out told her that i would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. she cried and begged me not to leave. i told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and i leave, or she aborts the baby and i stay. i would not let this go.

she didn't want either of those things to happen, so i told her we were done...

i feel shit. was i wrong?",8
"i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i don't know what to say to her.. hey everyone. i don't know what to do in this situation because i never expected i'd face something like this. i'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but i'm coming up seriously short here.

i met my wife on tinder at the end of 2015. we talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. by the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. we were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. more than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

i know, heavy topics for a first date. we were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

at the very least i held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. she immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

we dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. after getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

four nights ago was the first time i ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. my wife was out with a friend, and i was doing some house cleaning. i was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so i took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. at the bottom i saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case b were visible. i immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

i had known that my wife was on her period because when i tried to initiate sex, she told me so. i found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and i made comment about the timing being odd. she told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. i figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

i haven't told her that i found the box. when she got home that night everything was so normal. i tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

the more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. what if she was assaulted? what if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? what if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? or, what if she just cheated? i only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of plan b and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

i don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. we have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. i've done nothing to displease her, at least that i know of. maybe i'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than i'm giving it credit for. but i feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because i don't know how.

**tl;dr** i found a torn up plan b box in my trash. the only person who could have possibly thrown it away there is my wife. how do i bring this up?",8
"update 2: i 31m found out my fiance cheated during her 30f bachelorette party, planning on leaving. i am making this as i feel i owe it to all of you. the amount of pm's and responses have been incredible. many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. both the negative and positive comments have helped me and i would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

yesterday i was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. the only person i responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. i didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

during the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as i need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). my plans have changed a bit, i am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend i was supposed to go to. i called him up and let him know i want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but i know i will be leaving for somewhere. he said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. we will see how that turns out...

later in the day i responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since i sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
i picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. i could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. she kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. she i have misunderstood the entire situation... i could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). anyway i told her to explain it to me right then and there. she said because i only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that i should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. during the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
after she told me its all a misunderstanding i told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
after i hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). it didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. she said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. i was just quiet during most of it. the more i didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

she started telling me i can fuck other women if i want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
i told her fucking other woman was not something i needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
the sister was telling her stuff in the background but i couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

she kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. after that she started saying something but i just hung up. 

for like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. he told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that i always will be welcome to him and that i am a good guy. his wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. she tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. i politely tell her i appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

my ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. she then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
she kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and i didnt say much.

after some time i just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. she starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that i said i would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. i told the sister i only said i think about it, and now that i have i realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. she then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
the only thing i said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". after this i just hung up.

my phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. i dont plan on responding. i honestly feel alot better right now, like i can move on. i will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. if someting more happens i will update this post.

maybe i will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

i dont know when i feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, i am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

thanks!

edit 1: thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold i appreciate the support alot. i however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

i would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. i am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

also i dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity i dont mind answering them.

i also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). in a month? when i am back from vacation?

once again thanks for all the support

edit 2: my friend went over to get the ring from her but she refused to give it to him and told me she would not give it to anyone and that i have to pick it up by myself. i dont know why she is still acting like this. i am thinking of just letting the ring go and be able to have a clear mind.",8
"update from the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on christmas. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  my girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

i posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. it got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and i was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and i fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the big talk.

little did i know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. i didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. so thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, i got a dreaded ""we need to talk"" text. yep, all caps. and i was like ""welp, i'm dead.""

she was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). still, she said i had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and i agreed/apologized. she knows i'm writing this update and she's going to read it before i post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

we talked for a long time thursday night. she said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. it's partially a cultural thing, according to her. gf was born and raised in the u.s. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. she said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. she grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

on top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. she said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. she also got very little affection from her parents growing up. it seems like that was all replaced with material things. so, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

all that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. she was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. she was really hurt that i said i thought i was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and i said i was sorry, and i am. i was still raging a little when i wrote that. i asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. it wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

we've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. i'm totally fine this. we've been together for almost 3 years and i think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. she's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. we spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. it's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. i'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. no one can change their habits overnight.

we're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. the plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. she also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. it's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. we're going to give it until my lease is up in march (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. she isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before march.

tl:dr: thanks, reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. i did and i think things are going to get better.

edit

to everyone who's wondering, her parents are from mexico.

gf has a job and her own income. she is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. you're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. in that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. that's now just out there for the whole world to read. you can't say that wouldn't be alarming. she said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. all things considered, i think she was pretty reasonable about it. ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure i thanked reddit for the perspective. no, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. she's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",8
"i 26m upset a woman 20sf and my friends are acting like i'm in the wrong.. hey guys.

i went out clubbing last night with my friends. there were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. my girlfriend hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. i offered to stay in with her but she insisted i go out and have a good time. 

at the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. they were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

one of them, lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. she was pretty but i was not interested as i have a girlfriend. i told her this but she then started asking for pics of hannah. i showed her and she said that i ''could do better than that''. i was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

later me and my friends were dancing, and lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. i gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. a while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. she smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. i was absolutely fuming and in response i poured my beer on her head. she started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. i understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like i was wrong to pour my drink on her. they all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

the ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when i pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

nobody said goodbye to me last night and i made my own way home. i told hannah what happened and she agrees that i didn't do anything wrong. i tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

how do i sort this out in a mature way?

tl;dr: my friends are acting like i was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.",8
"update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met. this is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

as a quick summary: i thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend ""maggie"" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker ""joe"" and his wife ""kate."" after just a couple weeks, she was trusting joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to maggie's family thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. i thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or maggie had attachment issues.

i figured out what was going on and i feel like a huge idiot. i went to see maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if i didn't like what i heard i'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue i couldn't handle.

i had the opportunity when i saw the gifts maggie had gotten for joe and kate's kids. it seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

i asked maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to joe and kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for christmas.

i wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then maggie said that she used to exchange christmas gifts with joe and kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

i realized i was missing something important. if maggie had other christmases with joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like i thought. i had thought that maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but i didn't think maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. i didn't want to ask, so i acted normally until i left.

when i got home, i went through maggie's facebook. she wasn't lying and she's not crazy. i found a ton of photos with joe and kate going back a decade. from what i can figure out, they all went to college together, joe and maggie were big brother and little sister in a coed frat/sorority, and maggie and kate were roommates. i also found pictures of maggie as a bridesmaid in joe and kate wedding and pictures of maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. all of maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that i know all this.

i think this whole thing is my fault. i have adhd and i don't handle it well. i've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where i start zoning them out. i've been called out for this before. i think it's pretty likely that maggie did tell me about joe and kate and i just wasn't listening. maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so i think it's more likely that i wasn't listening when maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

this was a pretty big wakeup call for me. i've been ignoring my problem because i didn't want to face facts that it was serious but i know i need to do something before i make anymore mistakes. i'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.",8
"by buying everyone an ancestrydna kit and ruining christmas. earlier this year, ancestrydna had a sale on their kit. i thought it would be a great gift idea so i bought 6 of them for christmas presents. today my family got together to exchange presents for our christmas eve tradition, and i gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

as soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. she told us how she didn't want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. we explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

fast forward: our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

tl;dr i bought everyone in my family ancestrydna kit for christmas. my mom started freaking. now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

update:  thank you so much for all the love and support. my sisters, brother and i have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. no matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

update 2: christmas isn't ruined! my fu actually turned into a christmas miracle. turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. a good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. they never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. this is a christmas we will never forget. and yes, we are all excited to get our test results. merry christmas everyone!

p.s. sorry my mom isn't a whore. no you're not my daddy. ",4
"by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.. the overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. i bought a replacement bulb but when i put that one in it was also barely lighting up so i realized the unit was bad.  

the fan still worked great, it literally is the best fan i've ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. the fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so i didn't really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn't get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


so since then over the years my wife and i have had to make due with no overhead light. we open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. it's never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so i keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

after 6 years of living in the dark, this winter i just decided i would replace the damn thing. but before i did, i decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it's possible both bulbs i had tried were bad. 

so i'm up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as i'm turning the light on i realize:

the goddamn thing is dimmable. 


for 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to ""dim"". 

fuck me. 

tl;dr

for 6 years i lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",4
"by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.. today was the day i realised i messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

for the last 12 months i've been commenting on peoples posts, i've created my own posts. i haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as i can remember so i just figured i wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

last month i started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, i could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

anyway, i finally mailed the help team and found out my ip was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, i'm still in my own little truman show)

if you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

tl;dr i was muted one year ago and didn't notice. since then i've spent the whole time thinking how boring i must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

edit: so i've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! wilson and i thank you xx

edit 2: this is crazy! thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things i know nothing about. i'll figure it out and pay it forwards! special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - mvps!

please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that i've been such an idiot for so long. it's ok to laugh with/at me :)

edit 3: reddit is awesome. i've missed you guys! dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real pita. its just one of those things and i thank them for putting in the hours.

i also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. most of us here use reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

i love all of you weirdos <3

edit 4: no more i promise. i'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. i'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. i created an /ama when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/egcbe6w

stop giving me gold! i appreciate it but give to charity instead! heres something different we could do <3

"i have officially branded myself as the biggest perv... and i 100% deserve it.... this is his now ex-wife.

did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same reddit app? i logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.

i've removed all of this personal story for my family's protection and changed this account's password. although it might be too late and already circulated online.

i took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

i'm only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags do not.

i came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. i saw his update saying i seemed alright, but i was keeping it in for the next morning.

reason we slept in the living-room is because i didn't want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before i finished packing. it wasn't ""fun camping"" or a ""picnic"".

this morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

i went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

i'm not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this reddit gold to the comments that i feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

oh, and if you can read this, i've deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.

"by wearing a shawl, which ruined my relationship with my gf. minor background: i am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. i'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that i was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but i also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. i'm not gay, i just am me.

so while i was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. mine makes me look like a star wars character and his looks like the outlaw josey wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. the first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. whatever. so i get a call from my gf, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so i bid these mean girls and shawlbro adieu and head home.

i'm still wearing the shawl when my gf arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until i take it off. we get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if i'm gay. and she's really serious and aggressive about it. i tell her i'm not, that if i was i'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that i own a shawl. anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. so yesterday i invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to the big city, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually i just tell her very politely to get fucked because i'm pretty insulted by this point. on the way back, now that i'm not directly in front of her, i get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because i wore a shawl.

later on, i tell shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

we are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.

tl;dr: me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.

she's a nice girl, she's just not pickin up what i'm puttin down. it's a silly thing to be mad about.

"by swiping on my girlfriend's phone nsfw. so this happened a few days ago and i'm still not sure i'm 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

i've been with my girlfriend for about a year and i already know she is the love of my life. she's perfect for me. we're perfect for eachother. we're getting ready to move in with eachother and i want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

we went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

she went to the bathroom while i had her phone, and as i was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. if you have an iphone you know what i'm talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you're back at the start of the photo album. it's annoying as hell.

but some photos caught my eye. some photos that i really shouldn't be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

there she is, the love of my life, trying to get her mouth around the biggest dick i've ever seen in my life. i've watched porn - a lot. i've never seen a dick like this. i'm talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. longer and thicker. as far as i could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

i could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

i closed the pictures and i've acted like nothing has happened, but i cannot get these images out of my mind. i've never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats i'm significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

we haven't had sex since. i can't concentrate on my work. i just wish i had never seen those damn pictures.

tl;dr accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

/r/tifu last weekend. ,4
"by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.. recently, i traveled to denver, colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  as a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing i was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  what could possibly go wrong?

so the first thing i do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  and oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""are you looking for a mellow body high?  or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""yes, yes and yes!""  i reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  in hindsight, if i learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  sure, i can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite avogadro's number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

and it was at this dispensary that i also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and i were staying at).  as a result, before leaving, i begged my wife to buy some edibles that i could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  after expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

when we finally get back to the hotel room, i tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  what the fuck, denver?  seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that i should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" i read silently as i start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  but what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  so a second later, i covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

and then i quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  we may not have legal weed back home, but i routinely devour an entire package of milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

about 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  and that's when things start to go tits-up.  my stomach growls.  loudly and angrily.  my wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""diarrhea?""  but i merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""you didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""of course not."" i respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

a few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  i don't remember how i made it to my seat, and i don't remember even looking at the menu, but i do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if i was doing alright.

""keep it together, man,""  i say to myself.  but my wife's sudden groan suggests that i may have also said that to the waiter.  things are going downhill fast.

the waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

the moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  i start to worry that the jig is up.  

""you are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  not quite knowing what to do, i reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

at this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" i reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

my wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""bathroom. now."" she hisses. ""get it together.""  i reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  after splashing several handfuls of water on my face, i approach a urinal and start to pee.  

now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  as i am peeing, i start to get the very unsettling feeling that i have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

but deep down i know that is absurd:  i've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  i've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  so given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like i am about half way done -- that means that i've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

but the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  i try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

after finally finishing, i again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

next, i try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but i am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- i figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  to my wife's horror, i stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  but he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  he also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, i should probably eat one or two so that i'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

smart man. 

however, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, i start to get worried that i need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""do you think i should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" i suggest helpfully to my wife.

""what?! we literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

and at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""how many cookies did you eat?!"" she demands.

""whoa, easy there, torquemada,"" i respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""i had a few cookies, but keep it down.  i don't want your parents to know how fucked up i am right now.""

""really?!  they are sitting two feet away from you.  they know.""

i look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

tl;dr: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


edit:  wow!  thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  i think i have officially peaked in life.

as for part ii of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  at that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before i either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  so after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a secret service agent evacuating the president.  my night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  but being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""please don't die, we have a mortgage.""",4
"by accidentally getting sexual with my dentist, again.. i'm a 32 year old woman who can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because i'm an idiot.

i had my second dentist appointment today. i actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. he had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. his face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. i was a bit concerned and also confused. like how could i have embarrassed him this time? i had hardly spoken! so he keeps working in there and then i realize what the hell is happening. my dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. i had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time.

"by having my reddit history revealed by jimmy kimmel live on tv. this happened to me yesterday and i'm still baffled.

it all started when i posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor william h. macy. i couldn't stop laughin over it but i never thought it would gain so much attention. 

however it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes i could have imagined. this alone was crazy for me because i never expected to have a submission on the front page.

when i checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links i received. i checked them and found my submission on the latest jimmy kimmel show with reddit co-founder alexis ohanian. i was mind blown over this.

they proceeded talking over reddit users and jimmy ended up checking my history. well i hardly ever post filthy stuff but i commented on a nsfw a few days ago and i think jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

i don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. on the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. however i regret nothing!

"by cumming into a coconut. edit: i got an ama thread now. help me: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu


this didn't happen today but quite a few years back. for obvious reasons i'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

anyway, around 8 years back i lived in northern mozambique, a coastal southern african country with quite a warm climate. my mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. one of these was coconuts. she would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


anyway, being a horny teenager i fapped in regular intervals. unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and i was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. one day i hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. honestly to this day i can't fathom why i thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


i end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. i decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. i fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so i blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

for the next week the coconut is my saviour. whenever i want to get off i simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. it's heaven. now before i continue i'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


about a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (i had been using it pretty much every day since then) i begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. must be the coconut right? so i decide that i'll fuck it once more before i throw it out and get a new one.


**worst mistake i have ever made.**


you see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. as i penetrate the coconut one last time i begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. puzzled, i pull my cock out to discover that it is covered in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *teeming with tiny fucking maggots*. they were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


i screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck i was doing with my life. 


**never again. never again.**


tl;dr don't fuck coconuts.

"by asking reddit which ethnic group to exterminate. today i had been looking forward to the qualifying for the formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing reddit whilst also watching some older formula 1 footage on youtube. so it got me wondering, ""some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they're just boring and far too controlled"". so i posed the question to /r/formula1 to ask their opinions also. shortly after posting, it transpired that the way i had asked the question could be perceived as...a little...'hitlerish'. check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. it somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. unfortunately for me, i am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that i must open every single one. it would actually play on my mind so badly that i wouldn't be able to sleep if i didn't open them, so i must open and read every goddamn comment. probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. i thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where i was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. but then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ usa woke up. and i've been playing catch-up ever since. took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. let's see what i go back to now...

edit: thank you for the gildings you're all giving me, it's rather overwhelming.

the original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/formula1 somehow. 

as of 19:42pm gmt, i still have over 600 responses to read through. i will be reading them all, but i won't necessarily be responding to them all.

i'm really glad that i could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn't the original intention, but it's a great positive to take away from this experience!

edit 2: update - at around 20:20pm gmt, i opened up alienblue on my ipad to read these comments faster than on the official reddit app, and when i started from there i had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, i now have 976 unread messages -.-

edit 3: update - it's now 21:09pm gmt, i did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it's back up in the 4 digits. i am seriously sleep deprived right now, i have been awake since 16:00pm yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. finally they've subsided and i'm feeling really tired now, so i shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. i honestly didn't think this post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

edit 4: finally i'm able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. back down under 1000 left to go now, and it's been a truly interesting experience. i didn't realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, i also didn't expect some of the truly deplorable messages i have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. it's 6:00am gmt here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

edit 5: final edit, i'm now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17am. it's been great to see this happen, and i'm sorry to those who thought reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

"by telling my son's new doctor we are anti-vaxx. obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

my son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. we decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. i brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which i reply, ""oh, no he can't have that, i don't want him to get autism.""

i should maybe note here that i am an aspie too, and while i think my sarcasm is on point, i must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. the silence lasted an eternity while i imagine she was deciding how to proceed. eventually i laughed and tried to assure her i was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

as my son and i were discussing whether i was offensive (he thought i was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. he started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. he just kept saying, ""okay, well i have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. 

tl;dr: jokingly told my son's new doctor that i didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.

edit: of course we took the gardasil. shout out to nurse pete for being the first nurse to ever give my kid a vaccine without him crying or fist-fighting everyone. i wish everyone could have a nurse pete. also, since i'm editing, thanks for the awards!",4
"by performing the ""major tom"" technique and now i think i'm going to be disowned. if you aren't familiar with the ""major tom"", it's because it's a thing i (hopefully) came up with. it's a form of ""auto-erotic asphyxiation"" by using gravity.

basically, you jack off normally; but before you nut, you squat down as low as you can to the ground and breathe short shallow breaths while still whacking it. this part is called ""getting in the shuttle.""

as you nut, you jump up from that squatting position as fast as you possibly fucking can and hold your breath. this is considered ""take off.""

if performed correctly, you should become very lightheaded and experience pure bliss due to the orgasm from your cock rocket. this is called ""being in space"" due to the fact you feel like you're floating.

this is a technique that should be performed only by professionals, in a controlled environment. **i, however,** am not a professional despite creating the technique. you see, by hyperventilating and jumping up, you are literally cutting your brain off from oxygen. no oxygen = no consciousness.

when i ""took off"" i fucking jumped up at mach 50 and must've ripped a fucking hole in the goddamn space-time continuum. because the next thing i know i was laying on the ground with my dick out, covered in space juices from my trip around the sun.

before i could even pick myself up off the ground, my mom rushed into my room to see if i was okay. she heard my re-entry. this part is called ""disappointing your mother.""

you can just imagine the scene she walked into.

she stared at me with a mix of disgust, anger, and again, disappointment. i stared back with what i thought was confidence like i was buzz aldrin and just got back from the moon. but thinking back on it, it was probably embarrassment while i was desperately trying to put my space plane back in the hangar while getting on my feet as quickly as possible, and due to the fact, she's never caught me before. (at least not to my knowledge.)

she ended up closing the door and stomping her way back to the living room, presumably to watch more judge judy, and to take her mind off of what she just fucking witnessed; or consider disowning me. i cleaned myself up, taking off my spacesuit and putting civilian clothing on. somehow none of the rocket fuel managed to get in the carpet, just my clothes, and i managed to not even injure myself in the crash.

i'm currently writing this in my room right now, and i don't plan on leaving it anytime soon until i can think of what to say to her. if there is anything to say at all.

**tl;dr: tried a new experimental masturbatory technique, ended up passing out, mom caught me with my pants down, and now i'm stuck in my room. planet earth is blue and there's nothing i can do.**

**edit: only do this if you have a safe place to land if you fall. it is extremely easy to hit your head and die.**

"by agreeing to an ""open relationship"". obviously a throwaway. 

to put things into perspective, i (m 20) and my gf (f 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

we decide to spice things up a bit and ""open"" up our relationship a little. it was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole ""sex is fun"" idea.

she is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she's met a guy (m 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn't working at the time. i agreed. i tell her to go for it, and she does. she texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

the week after, she mentions she's meeting up with this guy again. wasn't expecting it but i'm cool with it. again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. a decision i would live to regret. she doesn't text me the entire night. weird, but okay maybe she's just having a good time?

the next day i receive a load of messages about how she needs a ""break"" from ""everything"" right now. meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. a little more conversation and we're over. she's completely cut me out of her life. i check her snap chat story, and of course, she's with him. i've heard from her friends that they're dating now. 

tldr; agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me.",4
"by sending nudes to my employee group chat.. tldr at the bottom- 

well i recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). with that being said i'm pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. i also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

we have a groupme for the store i work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
the previous night i had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that i was with at the time. no biggie right? 
the next morning i had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. noon rolls around and i needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue i was having with a computer i was working on. 
i typed what i needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as i clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, i hit send without thinking and go on about my day. i should also probably say that by this time i was working alone and closing so no one else was around. the customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left i went to check my phone and saw i had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first i thought he was just calling me about the question i had, while the phone was ringing, i went back to look at the groupme, to my horror i clicked not just a picture from the night before, but the whole damn video. my heart dropped, instantly when i realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my ""intentions"" where with the video and that he's never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. i tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. lol on the bright side the coworker i had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 


tldr: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out i send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end!

"by giving my son permission to beat his bully's ass.. my son was born with a condition called pectus excavatum. in layman's terms, his chest is sunken in. his condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. in december, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

about three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. the kid has been through a lot. 

well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. and because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, ""dad, i'm cleared now. a kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. can i kick his ass?"" well, my son isn't really a fighter. he's fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he's always gotten his ass kicked. so i just figured he was just talking. but this is the first i had heard about the bullying and i was concerned. i could tell he was distressed about the situation so i told him to knock the fucker out. he just nodded and went to his room. 

now, his older brother is s tough sob. he had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he's in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. i talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don't get in trouble. he told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. i asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. while i kinda agree with his thinking, i instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

the next morning i took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. on the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. ""have you taken xxxxx to school yet? well, after you do, go pick up your son. he got in a fight."" i just assumed it was my oldest son. imagine my surprise when i walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! he was beaming! he pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. ""i warned him."" i was so proud. 

he had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. my older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. he said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. he got suspended for three days. 

tl;dr i gave my son permission to beat up his bully because i didn't think he would and he did it.

edit one: the kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. it wasn't malicious. just two boys clowning around. he was horrified that he had hurt my son. the bully punched my son in the head every day. once he found out my son couldn't do anything about it, he just kept on. my son wasn't the only one he bullied, either. also, the bully's brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son could fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

edit two: my son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a lot of new friends. he used to hate going to school but now he's disappointed that school is out for summer. crazy!

edit three: thanks for the precious metals! and holy shit! front page?!?!",4

"by chilling at my friend's place while she wasn't home. my friend jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and i finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  i ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

i made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  dude was intimidating and i'm a 4'11"" woman so i was immediately scared.  he looked shocked to see me.  i'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that i surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

i panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  i'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  i start screaming at him to get the fuck out and that i'm calling the police (total bluff because i didn't have my phone.)  he then yells back that he is calling the police on me.  this gives me pause.  at this point, i look around and realize the bedroom i'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  i ask him through the door if he knows jenna (last name).  he tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  well.  apparently, jenna's neighbor also keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

so, today i fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  

tl;dr today i fucked up by wasting a sandwich.",4
"by sleeping with a married woman.. so, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. nsfw or for anyone, really. and i may not be alive much longer, because i'm probably going to be murdered.

i'm at the bar the other night, watching the hall of fame game. after it's over, i go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before i uber home. this girl sitting next to me, very attractive. out of my league. like wayyy out. i'm just scrolling through memes on my phone. and she asks me 

""hey! can i trust you to watch my things and not drug me?""

 ""uhh what?""

 ""can you watch my stuff while i go pee and not drug me"" 

to which the bartender said ""oh you can trust greg, he's really nice"". annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. just random shit. showed pictures of our dogs to each other. talked about shows n stuff. typical 'meet a girl at a bar' flirting shit. she asks if i've ever seen the show years and years. i say ""no, but i've seen the band perform live"". so she goes on about how great the show is, and how i need to watch it. asks if i have hbogo. ""yes because i forgot to cancel my cable after got"". so she makes me download the app, so i could start watching it when i get home. thanks for the recommendation! i'll probably check it out never. so a few minutes later, she said

 ""hey do you live close by?"" 

""yea, like half a mile""

 ""we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. i have a bottle of whiskey in my car""

""idk, my house is kind of a mess right now""

""that's okay, i have pets too"" (or something like that. all i was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

""i mean i guess, but i have to be at work early tomorrow""

""that's okay, i can only stay 30-40 minutes and then i'll have to go home""
""that's fine"" heh, cuz that's all the time i'll need! am i right, fellas??

no. nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

it's about, 11pm at this point. i think? and mind you, i've only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

so we tab out, get in her car. which is a stick shift. and i say ""oh no shit, i like you even more now! no one drives a stick anymore! i drive one every day!"" which i'm excited about, because at this point i'm thinking to myself ""hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows i like, and imma bout to get laid""

we talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn't the first time that this subject came up). which is just a half mile away. so was a short drive. she parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

go inside, i try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. while i try to get my chromecast set up on my living room tv. ya know, to ""watch hbogo"".

she runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

it's fucking evan williams.

and this is the first time where an ""oh no"" thought crosses my mind.

kids, i've slept with some strange in my time. i don't know how or why i get myself into these situations. i honestly feel that i'm a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. sure i troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but i do genuinely care about other people. being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. but in this case, i was dead wrong.

so after some talking about random shit. we get the show playing. i couldn't even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

sex.

so after, we're just laying there. pillow talk. was a good night. i just got laid. she asked if she could stay the night. we're gonna go to sleep. everything is cool. i let her know that i have to be at work in a few hours, so i need to get some rest.

now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* right?

wrong.

i say ""that was great we should do this again sometime""

""i don't think so""

""what why?""

""i don't think my husband would appreciate that""



i am speechless. i don't think i've ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. like, how the fuck did i not see this coming. omg imma home wrecker. i'm probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

me: ""ummmmmmm what? is this an open relationship? does he know where you're at? like, why didn't you tell me that?""

her: ""idk, does it matter?""

""uh yeah, i'd be pretty pissed if i was him""


now i've been cheated on before. and that feeling sucks. i've been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. where i didn't know that i was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. i had found out a couple days later, and i found him on fb and let him know. he thanked me, and didn't get mad at me at all. cheating is the worse thing ever.

so this is where shit starts to hit the fan. i don't remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

her: ""we're getting separated soon""

me: ""well you're still fucking married to him""

""yea but that's okay""

""how is that okay?""

""he's been..... abusive""


there's a slight pause, then she starts crying. so this is where the sober me starts to kick in. this girl is struggling. she's in a bad spot. and no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. and now i'm trying to empathize with this trashy evan williams drinking bitch. like i legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

que the panic attack.

she starts going nuts. ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. knocking shit over. basically trashing my house.

she asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. which i do. she takes it. and calms down. (for the most part).

now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. i tell her that we need to go to sleep. because i have to work in the morning. she tells me ""(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy"" btw, evan williams isn't that bad when you're slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

we finally get to sleep around 4? maybe? i wake up late, she wants round 3. and who doesn't like morning sex. i'm still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. so i gave her a fuck.

anyways, i need to leave for work. but her car is blocking mine. i tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can't because she didn't know where her clothes were. and told me i couldn't move it because ""i didn't know how to drive it"" 

""uhh, this is the third time we've had this conversation. i drive a stick every day, i can move your car""

i move her car. i leave for work. and i just let her stay at my house. i let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. two, i was already running late, and fuck it she'll probably leave before i get home.

a couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. i get concerned, because i'm starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. i came to the conclusion that i should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... but, i see that she had already messaged him. from my facebook account! my computer was still logged into fb when i left, and i didn't think to log out or shut it off or anything.

i tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. he lets me go home. when i get home, i find her still naked in my bed. i get her friend to get her an uber. and i leave. oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

go back to work. thinking everything is over. that's the end of that. wrong again.

i get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. and only that shirt. like vag all out and everything. this girl is afraid to go home. which i'm worried about at this point. because i want her to go somewhere safe. she's refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

oh yea, she had me find her phone. which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. and several others from other people.

she hands me $20 to order a pizza. and after we eat the pizza, she'd uber home. fuckin bet. i ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

i kid you not. i'm sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. and she just opens her legs and says ""make it quick""

this bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and i'm just ready for her to leave.

sex.

after, we're just sitting there, and she starts crying again. asking to go home. and i'm like 

""i'll get you an uber home, but you gotta put pants on""
""no""

""what do you mean 'no'? you can't get in an uber with your pussy out""

""no""


so i gather up all of her belongings and clothes. and try to help her get dressed. to which she refused to allow me to do.

most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... that ""arch"" thing that women do when you're pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#i had the same feeling when i got her panties on.

pizza arrives. i go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. come back inside. panties are off again. god dammit.

we never even opened the pizza box. she's saying that she wants to go home. but is refusing to get dressed. i'm starting to panic myself. because i don't know how i got myself into this situation. but, am me.

she eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that's she having with her husband. and i read through the conversation, it's her sending multiple texts saying ""i'm so sorry babe"" ""idk where i'm at"" ""come get me"". and him saying ""nope sorry"" ""this is on you"" and ""call 911""

that last one though. that's what i did.

before i called 911, i offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because i knew the husband would give her a ride back there. and not to my house. because now i'm starting to worry about my safety. i don't want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. but then again she states that ""you don't know how to drive my car"" with it being a stick and all. even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

i told them that i have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. etc. i tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn't answer.

the ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. this girl is drunk crying. trying to get me to go for yet another round. where at this point, my dick hurts. also, ""girl you need to get dressed, you're gonna be going home""

finally got her panties back on, i didn't tell her that i had called the cops. i told her that the uber was coming. and was trying to get her to put her pants on.

cops show up, i go outside. explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. but i kept my calm. i told them that i was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. but they can't force her to go anywhere she didn't want to. she wanted to go home. officers ask if she was presentable. i pop my head back in the door. she's still wearing my shirt and her panties. so i'm like ""i guess?"", and then i let them in.

she yells ""are you fucking serious? you called the cops?"" 
""uh yea, you didn't wanna leave. even though you said you did. plus your husband said to call 911, so that's what i did""

the officer said to her ""you're on this man's property, and he wants you to leave""

que crying and what not.

cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. which i do. her husband calls her phone, so i accept the call, and then put it up to her face. tell her to tell him what's happening. and that she is getting an uber home. apparently her card and paypal was getting declined for the ride. so she couldn't do it herself. they live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. i live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a lyft/uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... girl finally decides to get dressed.

i had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... i could see the officer's partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. lol.

anyways, i hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she's still wearing mine) to the officer. made sure she had all of her belongings. we get her to walk out of my house to the uber. but she tried to grab the bottle of evan williams. to where i audibly laughed. ""i don't think they'll let you take that""

cops didn't let her take it. she got in the uber and she was gone. policeman handed me the bottle back. where i say ""usually this is the other way around, ha""

po-po leave, i call it a night, and it's over.

flash forward to today. i get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she's asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. i was at work at the time. so i wasn't able to check. but i'm 98% certain i handed those over to the cops. i look for them when i get home. found nothing.

oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

so that brings us to now. i haven't heard anything from her. or the husband. and i'm not sure if it's safe for me to go home. but ya. know what? fuck it. i'm glad i could share this story with y'all. there might be more to come, but you'll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

the moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

jk don't do that.

and don't stick your dick in crazy.

tldr: took a girl home who i didn't know was married. she trashed my house.

edit: i'm not gonna change ""que"" to ""cue"" because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while i deal with mine.

edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2gia

edit 3: her car is still there. can't get it towed, because it's on a public street. i'm still alive. i see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. i'll get to them when i can.

edit 4: fml. i sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. no response. bartender texted me late last night and asked if i used a condom. which many of you have asked.... and no. i didn't. the girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. so i think i may have been baby baited.

edit 5: i'm still not dead. her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor's house. i just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. so i walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it's front of their house... this woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. and she's most likely high on meth. because when i asked her ""hey do you wanna get this car that's in front of your house towed?"" she said ""no, noooo hehe"" i'm like ""yea, i'll talk to y'all tomorrow"" just wtf.

**update**

i've been texting a mutual friend of the couple. apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. i'm in the works of a tifupdate. but i'll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. i'd like to protect the privacy of those involved, but i'm just too lazy to do it right now.",4
"by thinking divorce was an april fools gag. let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

my borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. they told the family they are getting divorced. i broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying i'm no april fool.

*edit*

wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

*edit 2*

i don't think i'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. this blew up and i just got multiple texts from my wife telling me i fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... and i didn't change any names 

*edit 3.0*

ok it's been fun everyone, i may see you all again next week with tifu by making a tifu post about divorce that ultimately lead to my own divorce. 

*edit 4.0*

uhh this post is getting deleted. it's been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.

*edit 5*

final edit. fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on reddit) how big of a dumbass i am.

thanks for everyone who said i'm not the asshole. i may have autism, but i'm not an asshole. 

*edit 6*

once again was wrong, /pinnacleclub what up

give me a couple days to sleep on releasing the video. i've got it, i've just got to convince my wife to release it. ",4
"update: i fucked up by not knowing the guy i like works on the same floor as me and telling my friend loudly that, ""he could fuck me in the ass."". link to og post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/

two months ago, i fucked up. i was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. i ended up realizing, not in a way that i wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab i work at. 

basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and i were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when i said, ""i would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" he overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. i was so fucking mortified. 

i didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. that didn't happen. on my first day back, i was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""oh fuck,"" i had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that i ought to apologize for my crass comment. but instead, i frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if i do that, he can't see me right? that didn't happen again. instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""hey my name, how was your break?"" 

i looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. he told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. he didn't bring up what happened either thank god. then he said something along the lines of, ""is that all your having for lunch?"" and i was like, ""uhm yeah, i was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

then he said, ""oh i was gonna go grab something to eat at a sandwich place near us, do you wanna come with?"" 

i was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. i tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so i said sure and we went. 

well. we ended up having a great lunch. inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""so tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think i spent staring at you?"" i literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""it has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? that has to mean i like you."" (btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

even with my shock, i managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

we have not done the butt stuff. he told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. looks like i will be retaining my butt virginity and i managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

tl;dr: despite my fuck up, it all worked out. we're celebrating one month together tomorrow! also, i'm a girl (got two comments asking if i was).

edit: yes, i accidentally wrote ""guess"" instead of ""guest."" my b, my b. ",4
"by genuinely forgetting i had a joint in my pocket and trying to board a plane in amsterdam and getting caught.. so this literally just happened 30 mins ago. 

i would freely and happily admit if i tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. 

came with a couple of friends for the weekend to amsterdam for a birthday. it's a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

i'm sure most people know the dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit 'coffee shops' and buy and smoke joints. 

had a fun party night last night in town. went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

in a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, i put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...'did i ditch that joint'?

at this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

'sir, do you have anything in your pockets' says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

holy. fucking. shit. what to do? i'm still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. do i come clean? no way-too late for that. got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. 

go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. but, schiphol airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. i'm asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. i'm sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did i smoke that joint??? airport guys hands pats pocket. i feel object being pressed into hip. fuck fuck fuck. 

'sir, empty your pocket please'? says airport guy. my partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. in slow motion i see the penny drop on his face. i dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. i feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

i'm dying inside. i say to pat down guy, 'oh god. i'm really sorry, i forgot that was in th...'
'haha, sure, sure - thats what they all say'! laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

i'm placed to one side. customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, 'don't worry sir! don't look so scared! you are 20th today and you won't be last! i'm sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately i can't let you leave amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home'. 

i almost wept with relief. i was made to sign a form to say he'd taken joint off me....and that was it...

i'm in a bar in schiphol airport in amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. to all you dutch-bless your hearts. you're the best. i'm sorry i was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

tldr i was a hot mess and genuinely forgot i had a joint in my pocket. got caught with it. dutch customs were amazing about it. 

edit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)

edit 2, thanks for the shiny stuff. first awards (on a story about my drug use).  i'm from uk for those asking.. my flights just landed and i made it through uk customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. i've just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. it says under what was taken, 'joints'. 

edit 3-schiphol doesn't frisk as matter of routine, yes i get it. thanks for correction.",4
"by getting reddit banned in russia. today reddit was blocked in russia, and i am the one who posted this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/rudrugs/comments/1derq9/%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%b8_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b4_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%89%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%bf%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b1%d1%8b/) which lead to this.

in russia, there is a law which allow roskomnadzor, russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. two years ago i tested how rkn react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. on of that websites was reddit.

one thing i learned is that rkn doesn't want to block popular websites. they respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. it was on 05/21/2013(https://img.bi/#/vn0xdfz!sufwaazuq0ogfp6njqpmgqpwensqfa4kln1gdqhz). on 10st aug 2015 they posted a call to help them contact reddit administration(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official vk page. funny thing, but they called psilocybe a plant. several hours ago they reported that reddit is blocked in russia(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). seems like things changed.

how reddit is blocked? fully. as reddit switched to https, there is no way to block special page.

will i remove this post? no. i also think that reddit administration needs to do nothing. this is important issue on freedom of speech, and only rkn want to violate it.

btw, this post is a guide for indoor growing psilocybe mushrooms in russian. i'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to rkn.

"by trying to gift my bf some sweet undies and subsequently spoiling his surprise proposal plans.  about three weeks ago, i began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who i'll call ""ray,"" to celebrate 4 years of dating.

we live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. he's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. i thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt i get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. they are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

i ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. i used his email on the sign-up so that i could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

one small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. i sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which i mean i entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. i simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. i know how to do this because i'm a brilliant hacker (i googled it).

while carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: a shipping confirmation for an engagement ring. i immediately noped off his computer, and of course i didn't open the email, but the damage is done. secret's out!

my heart fell right through my butt, you guys. i actually died and now i'm a ghost writing this.

i probably should have pretended i never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but i was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. within the hour i broke down and called ray to sheepishly confess what i had done. he wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that i spoiled the surprise. 

here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

my punishment for snooping is that the suspense is killing me. i've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

a romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, i thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""why would you think that i'm going to propose to you?"" he said. ""that sounds like something you wouldn't know about because i'd keep it secret in my personal email!""

now he's started intermittently faking me out. the other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. he keeps getting down on one knee... looking up at me... and saying, ""gotta tie this shoe!"" the emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is maddening. every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

one more thing: i somehow fucked up the email settings. the shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. so that surprise got spoiled, too. turns out i'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

i guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and i do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

if we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

i shriek. not a barbarian shriek. not a viking shriek. psycho-shower-scene shriek.

"by making a girl i like laugh so hard she ended up in hospital and i almost lost my job.. so there's this girl i like at work, and we're really good friends. we're having lunch and we're making those ironic depression meme jokes as most friends do. for some reason i (in my unknowingly- stupid way to get her laugh) got the idea to say ""well hey, you know what's just one letter away from sad? dab!"" and promptly did the deed. also i have ability to cry on demand so i just stared stone-cold her and let two tears fall down.

she finds it funny. extremely funny. so funny she drops to the floor and starts laughing her ass off. after a good thirty seconds she starts grabbing her chest and coughing. i asked if she was okay when she starts wheezing and begins to convulse a bit. freaking the fuck out and thinking she's having a damn seizure, i start to reach for my phone.

and in the exact second, my manager randomly decides to come in and sees this big guy towering over this poor little girl on the floor. i only manage to cut off her impending rage by saying i think she's having a seizure and i'm calling 911. fortunately, i was able to explain to her what happened after the ambulance came.

turns out she has asthma, and my joke caused a flare-up, and was waving her arms to try to tell me to get her inhaler. whoops.

"by taking a picture of my wife's ass. this happened about a week ago.

after  a few minutes of mindless wandering, i notice her on the other side of  the store. i also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as i'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, i hear someone behind me shout ""hey creep! why are you  taking a picture of that girls ass!?"" i turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

i  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. my wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that i had to leave. she explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

&#x200b;

the employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. honestly i'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. it was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

"by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.. so, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. one of the classes i was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. while the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. for our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. i did my paper on helium-3 power generation. i worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. the papers were due last night at midnight and i held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. this is where i fucked up big time.

let me tell you a little about myself. i don't work a normal job. i tried it in my first year of school and i really didn't like it. i've worked internships when they came up but outside of that i really didn't ""work"". this and being a student really doesn't mix well though. so, i had to make money some way. for the past 3 years i've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. specifically, for furries. i would write anything. any fetish, any premise, anything. in some parts of that community i became really popular. at one point i was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts i charged  to my customers. am i proud of this? no. i have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. i told myself the minute i got a ""real"" job i was cutting and running from this work.

well, this brings us to last night. i had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. i had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. i was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. i was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. i ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. however, instead of submitting my final paper, i somehow submitted one of the commissions i was working on. this commission is not light either. it is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

so, i went to bed. submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. when i woke up this morning i checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

i want to fucking die right now. i don't know how i'm going to explain why instead of my final i submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. but yeah, i fucked up big time.

tl:dr: in my final semester at college. instead of submitting my final research paper, i submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. professor ""want's to talk"" and i want to die.

&#x200b;

obligatory update:

well, i just left his office and i still want to die. not as much though. i took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  i won't lie, when i sat down with him i was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. i guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

i ran down pretty much everything i said here. while he didn't agree with the avenue i was taking to make money he understood why i was doing it.

he had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""customer\_commission\_2nd draft.doc""). i've taken a class from him before and was an a student so he guessed i had submitted the wrong file on accident. he told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

i gave him the copy i brought and he accepted it. he told me to email him the file and he would replace the one i had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" he seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what i had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

like i said. i still want to fucking die right now. at least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . thanks i guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown.",4

enter stage left lesbian porn. here's the part where i mention how my clit is made of steel. i came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. for some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. having finished the porn (which i actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) i decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. now, whenever i'm jerking off to just my vile thoughts, i always have to go completely under the covers. unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where i live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? anyway, for some reason i can't come on my own if my head isn't under some blankets/cloaked. maybe saudi arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? since this incident i've only slept for four hours. i'm losing my mind. 

anyway, at this point i'm abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. after ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. my clit breathes a sigh of relief and i emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. my right eye is stinging a little bit, and i realise the acne treatment i'd put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. i grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

i'm sure you can see where this is going, but i certainly didn't. and now i could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. i wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. the weird angle i'm bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. for some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. i felt genuinely betrayed. like, how dare you? you did this to me. this is your fault. et tu, clite? 

once my eye starts to swell up, i call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. arguably the weirdest walk of shame i've ever done. 

i continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn't go down, an eye patch. the swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. my eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of ""what the fuck have i done"" red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

now i've got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that i'll probably have to cancel. i've been wanting to bang this guy for weeks. also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and i can't even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish i'm shit out of luck. 

tl;dr: i masturbated and now i'm
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

edit: sweet baby jesus's clit, what the fuck? this blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if i wrote it. damn my unforgettable mothman musical. anyway, i did not cancel my dick appointment. i told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (less endearing when i got to his place and wouldn't stop dirty talking using pirate puns. i've never been more grateful for the colloquialism ""booty""). also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. hallelujah.

edit #2: clearly the reddit detectives have all suffered a stroke because numerous people have been sullying my good name in the comments with accusations of heterosexuality. to clarify: i'm bi. also, thanks for all the cool shit and stuff, i guess.",4
"by letting my son take my wife's menstrual cup for show and tell. my wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. sometime over the weekend i noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. i asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it's versatility- over the next few days it helped the paw patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. it came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. i loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. 

fast forward to this morning and as we're getting ready for school alexa reminds us that it's show and tell today at school. so my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. i pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. my son looks happy so i figure he's not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he's proud of. 

our conversation:

teacher: ben's show and tell was...interesting. 

me: yea! it's cool right? we've been playing with that thing for days. 

teacher: uh, mr. scott, do you know what that is?

i start to panic- oh shit it's not a toy...

teacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. 

i get confused. 

teacher notes my confusion: it's um, used to collect menstrual blood...

i'm still confused...

teacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood

me: it just...stays in there? 

she nods. 

me: are you sure? i don't think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. 

teacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....

we're both clearly uncomfortable. 

me: alright then.....so where do i get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. 


my wife laughed hysterically when we told her. my son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.

tl:dr thought my wife's menstrual cup was a toy and my son and i played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell

edit: wow!!!! i cannot believe this got so much attention. i'm glad everyone got a good laugh. a bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn't know it was me, though. 

my wife has been reading the comments and insisted that i clarify that i know all about her cycle. we are ttc currently and, just as it was with our son, i know when she's ovulating, i track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. i grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices i was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. i was also confused by it ""fitting"" because, like i said, this device helped save a chickoletta over the weekend. i've seen a tampon- they're much slimmer than this cup is. my wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn't even feel it's presence after it's im position. 

i'd like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife's approval.",4
"by hiding my staple addiction and making my family think i was a heroin junkie. ever since i was a kid, i loved to fiddle around with staplers. playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. one of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. there are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes i'd break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. i've even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&#x200b;

this progressed from me messing around with staples in ms. grady's second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. i had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? well...

&#x200b;

fast forward to present day. i am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. i have a home, a normal car, an office job. i am by all accounts a normal human being... **i still love staples.** working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. i'd spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. it got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&#x200b;

so i had to stop doing that...i turned to amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. it wasn't enough. i went to 20, then 40. my wife got curious then and asked ""why are you buying all of these boxes of staples"". but i brushed it off as a work issue that i'd get reimbursed for and knew i had to change my methods.

&#x200b;

over the course of a few months i enabled myself...i started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. i would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. i began to stay out late and tell my wife i would be home soon, so i could go buy more staples from different stores. i opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn't know but she caught it in the mail. she got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&#x200b;

this past thursday after one of my ""late nights"" i get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. i walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. because it is.

&#x200b;

my wife asked if there was anything i wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. i sat down and kept saying ""what are you talking about"" until my mom said ""honey, we saw the pictures"". then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. this man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me ""do something"" with what i had in the bag from multiple stores. it basically looked like i was a drug runner for office depot who was using some of the product for myself. at this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. i had to come clean and all i could muster was

&#x200b;

""i...i like staples.""

&#x200b;

the wtf looks i got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when i showed them my car....i came clean. i backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. right now my only concern is my dad. he didn't laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&#x200b;

believe it or not, i think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. i may or may not do that, but the good news is i now can have a ""staple hour"" once i get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&#x200b;

tldr: i have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought i was on drugs when it became a problem.

edit: 

thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! i am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. if you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, i just ask that you dm me/name the throwaway so i can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people's perspectives on my problem.

1. i went to see a therapist today with my wife. i was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, i do need help. i am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. just tailored to my specific issue.

2. apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. that included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. so after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. my wife initially thought i was having an affair. she didn't think i was doing drugs until she got the pictures. the pi just told her what he saw, and she deduced that i had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. she admitted that she didn't think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. i do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. i am just an addict, and an idiot. i know how stupid the addiction is and so i tried to hide it. it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things i guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control.",4
"tifu by sending my wife a random dick pic. so this afternoon my wife was out at the pharmacy that's less than three minutes from our house.  she called because our insurance card wasn't working and asked for the numbers on the new cards we had just been issued. i started to read the numbers to her but she interrupted saying it would just be easier if i took a picture. to be funny i included my man parts in the photograph.  when she got home, i asked her how she liked the picture i had sent. she seemed genuinely clueless and didnt know what i was talking about.  apparently she just handed the phone with the picture open to the pharmacist to grab the numbers off himself. 

tl;dr: sent my wife a dick pic with insurance info that she  subsequently showed to the pharmacist at our local grocery store.  ",4
"by destroying the entirety of my family for only $99. throwaway account.

we've all been seeing the recent craze of dna testing and whatnot, so my dad and i decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. we got our results back a few days ago and i went into the dna relatives section to check out my matches. at the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% dna with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. this didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. my cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. we're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

i couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what i was seeing and i had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. the only realistic explanation for what i was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. all the dots lined up and i felt a sense of *loss*. i sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then i had a feeling of anger come over me. i needed some fucking answers. 

without even thinking, i rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. my mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. she had no idea my dad and i had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. my mother and i never had a 'traditional' relationship. she was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

my irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. i asked her if she cheated on dad with uncle david (name changed for obv reasons). i have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. she looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""what kind of question is this? of course not."" i told her everything; the test, percentages, dna matches, all of it!! shit hit the fan. my mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

i left her there and went back into my room. i called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. she ended the call screaming. dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. i told him everything too. he didn't say anything after calming down. he left the room and i locked the door. 

for the next few hours, i heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. my parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. my aunt in law and david showed up shortly later and i'm pretty sure i heard my dad and david get into some physical fight. utter chaos. 

i feel like fucking shit. ik it's not my fault but i can't help feeling that this is all because of me. if i had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. i'm too scared to go outside. i don't even know what the outcome was. the only noise i hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and i sure my dad is out of the house. fuck my life

tldr; mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. i take a dna test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. i've locked myself in my room and i'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

"by leaving thc chocolate out and sending my mom into orbit on edibles. my cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of thc chocolate for christmas, because he'd mentioned that maaaaaybe he'd want to get high. my parents are 75-year old republicans. that was a big maybe.

&#x200b;

well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. you put half a candy bar down and yoink, gone when you come back.

&#x200b;

you can guess what happened. my mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. her last words, high as a kite, were ""i think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&#x200b;

they took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. at which point i assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the redbull orbit jumper.

&#x200b;

anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. so now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.

obligatory gold edit: thanks all for your well wishes! ! a few things to clear up - mom went into the hospital on saturday. as of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in manhattan where she awaits surgery details. i'm in canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but i'm planning to head back down to ny this weekend to be with her. also....op is not a dude. :)

second update from my dad: mom's surgery may be thursday, with the holidays and all. i decided not to mention that i put the story on the internet.

fp edit - thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. i'm headed back to the states on thursday, the tentative surgery date. will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

update - mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. all of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

check out my adorable mom

"by saying i was tired to my wife.. came home from the gym. its leg day. had full day at work too. work isn't bad. came home to happy kids. wife does a great job at keeping them alive. the best. had to take a shower before bed. wife says hurry because shes tired. i empathize by saying i will hurry because i am also tired. bad idea. wife proceeds to tell me how she is the most tired because of kids. i do not dispute this since i am not a total moron. kids are exhausting but totally worth it. i tell her as much. she is most tired. i am only kind of tired. not good enough. she is more tired. i agree with this in order to ease the tension. unsuccessful. she is fully triggered by the fact that i had the audacity to say that i was tired. there is no escape. am screwed. 


tldr: am not allowed to be tired. ever.

edit: wow. that's a lot of comments and stuff. thanks, reddit. this weekend i will celebrate with a nap! cheers! what makes this cool is that i wrote it while pooping before bed. cant wait to tell my wife!

edit 2: my wife is the best. seriously the best. i'm not taking her back to the dealership. this was one of those events where you laugh about it 5 minutes later.  tonight we are going on a date so it's all good.


that a lot of you guys would not survive married life or kids. lol.

"by being too horny to notice something had gone horribly wrong. nsfw. well, this didn't happen today. but it's a funny story that i couldn't share with reddit at the time.

rewind back to me at 14 years old. awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. 

as such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing ""boobs"" and ""butts in thongs"" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. 

one night, to avoid watching tv with my dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, i claimed that i had ""homework"" to do. of course, this was a lie. i just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. 

so i fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.

now this is where things went wrong. i got horny and forgot the layout of my house.

you see, my bedroom was upstairs and i had no door. a sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my dad, his wife, and her two kids were watching tv. 

the desktop was right next to the staircase, but i figured that the tv was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. i was right.

but what i didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. 

i also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. 

i eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.

and that's when i turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that i was casting a giant shadow puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. a perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. and i had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.

so i did what anyone would do in that situation. i put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until i heard the tv come back on. then i went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. 

no one ever brought it up. and i'm thankful. but i know what they saw. and i'm still cringing.

tl;dr: got horny. got stupid. projected a masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. still embarrassed.

edit: well shit. glad yall are enjoying this funny little moment. 14 year old me would me mortified.

edit: holy fuck lmao. i'm proud and ashamed of how much yall liked this.",4
"by explaining my synesthesia to my boyfriend. i have grapheme-color synesthesia. basically i see letters and numbers in colors. the letter 'e' being green for example. a couple months ago i was explaining it to my boyfriend who's a bit of a skeptic. he asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. since then he'll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what i said a few months ago. always being the sameish as course. he still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe i just memeroized them really really well.

tonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. i tried explaining to him i just see the colors automatically when i visualize the letters in my head. i asked him what colour are the letters in his head. he looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in ""my head, that's not a thing"" 

my boyfriend didnt understand what i meant by visualizing the letters. he didn't believe me that i can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. 

turns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. when he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. he can't picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. he thought it was just an expression to say ""picture this"" or etc... its crazy to him the fact that i can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.

now i have a boyfriend that is really upset. he feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. he's been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing i wasnt pulling his chain. hes pretty upset and i feel really bad. 

tldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (cant visualize anything at all)

edit; oh wow this blew up. i just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn't being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. he never thought i was lying. i think it's one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it's way harder when you have aphantasia.",4
"by ruining a joke my wife has been saving for years.. tomorrow i'll be turning 32.  as we were waking up this morning she asked me if i was excited for the plans we'd made for my birthday. i responded that it was going to be tough to do everything in half a minute, but i was looking forward to it nonetheless.

she looked at me, blank-faced for a couple seconds. i thought she was just trying to make sense of what i had said. instead she suddenly smacks my chest and yells at me that i ruined a joke she's been holding onto for years. i didn't believe her until she showed me an email from 2016 that she had sent to herself to remind her to set a calendar event so she wouldn't forget. 

it took her ten minutes before she was calm enough to talk to me again. unfortunately for her i've known and used the 30-second birthday joke for years.

"by falling asleep in the back of my boyfriend's car. last summer. we're on a road trip from new mexico to mexico. we have a honda element converted for living in, so i crawl in the back to nap while he's driving. he stops at a gas station in the desert of arizona and while he's pumping, i get out to use the bathroom. come back out, don't see him, and walk around the parking lot to have a look. i jokingly think to myself that maybe he drove off not knowing that i got out to use the restroom, but brush that off. i sit on a bench outside twiddling my thumbs, realizing this may now actually be the case. i reach for my phone to call him, but of course my phone is in the car.

i go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don't have one. obviously they do, but whatever. so i start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we're in the middle of nowhere and they think i'll steal it i guess. i go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. i realize i don't know my boyfriends number by heart so i just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he'll answer. he doesn't. i use one person's phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend's number, but alas, his phone is dead when i call.

i resort to explaining to everyone whose phone i ask to use my situation. some don't believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and i was just being modest. it's been about 2 hours now. the store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, i'm still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.

a cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. i explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. she tells me i can't stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. i ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. we're driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he's at the gas station and there's a guy there looking for his girlfriend. i just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. and there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn't believe he'd actually done that. 

he said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized i wasn't in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he's ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. and that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. he thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. 

edit: i understand ifu by not relaying my need to pee.
also that it all sounds really stupid objectively and in retrospect, but it makes sense how things happened at the time. also have never heard of this last man on earth episode until now, so that's pretty funny. i have many a text message/facebook post to prove this happened irl.

tldr: went to use the bathroom while my boyfriend was pumping gas, he didn't know, drove off, and i was stranded, asking people to use their phones for hours until police were called to come get me.",4
"by not washing under my foreskin for the first 15 years of my life. this is long so tldr at the bottom.

this happened around 6 years ago when i was in 9th grade. i grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. my parents never taught me anything about genitals and i apparently never asked, all i knew was that's where the pee came out.

so one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. i was pretty shocked because that's certainly not how mine worked. by that time i was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

so armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work i went home and a few google searches led me to discover that i had a severe case of phimosis. so being the pragmatic young buck that i am i also google how to fix it. there were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel i opted for the latter option. i got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom's bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

after about 4 hours of stretching i finally started making some progress! i could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell i've ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. it dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. i kept stretching over the course of a few days and i started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as i stretched. some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as dick cheese. 

i cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. that was about to change real fucking fast.

so this was about 10 days into my stretching and i'd gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. i was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so i got very impatient and i decided i'd try to force it all the way back that day i lubed and got to work, i pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. i pulled it till i couldn't bear the pain anymore. i did this over and over again for around 3 hours until i somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. i got way too excited and despite the pain i gave it one big yank and i felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. it hurt like hell but i was just so relieved that i didn't care. i opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. the entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. that was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where i tore the top part of my foreskin when i yanked it over the glans. i freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. it eventually stopped and then i had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. i eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. i was still hurting but i was finally done. i got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. i thought that was it. i tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn't budge so i just left it.i completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. you know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? that's how my penis looked. i went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

when i got home i was still in major pain so i decided i'd check on it. i undressed in the shower and looked down at it. the first thing i saw were the blisters. two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. the next thing i noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. i'm a black guy.

i realized that if i didn't find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. i lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. this was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. i kept trying to force it back over and i put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  my penis was on fire at this point and i was holding back tears but i kept pushing until i felt it pop back over the glans. judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain i felt i guess the second blister popped too. once again i left it and fucking went to bed. 

i checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. i rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks i was pretty much ok. my foreskin was still tight and i do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. even if they aren't as stupid as i was don't take that risk lol

tl;dr; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because i got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn't get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. 

edit: so i didn't expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! 

so while i'm happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, i'd like to clear up something. this post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  rather, i'd like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. 

for those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. don't be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. they have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. for those of you who aren't old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. believe me it's not as awkward that you think. don't risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like.

"by c*mming so hard i fainted. so this happened a couple of days ago..

had a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. after changing back to my old wash and my rash didn't showing any indication of subsiding, i went to visit a dermatologist. anyways, turns out i have a skin condition called pityriasis rosea, which isn't actually serious and should go away on its own. so she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. after showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and i sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. i noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scratching my back reaalllyyy good. so naturally i took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. naturaly i decided to take it to the next logical level: flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (yes i know this sounds mildy retarded). what ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. i busted a nut so hard i started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and i fucking fainted. my parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a reaaal worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. so yeah, my mother hasn't looked me in the eye for like 2 days. fml

tl;dr: found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided i wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. came so hard i went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.

i'm legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol

edit: wow i had no idea this would blow up like this! thanks for the golds, silvers and platinum kind strangers!

ps: am looking into becoming hair dryer sales guy now",4
"by tipping my pizza delivery driver $1100. so today i sold my bitcoin i bought 2 years ago i spent like $100 on the investment or something, i cashed it out at a bitcoin atm and brought it home the first thing i did to celebrate was buy some edibles. i buy some edibles eat a whole brownie and am out of it, i order some pizza and take some money from my wad and put it in a pile on the table next to me total was like 20 so i put 23.

since i'm high af the pizza delivery girl knocks i grab the wad of all the money not the $23 stack. i give it to her and she starts crying she keeps saying are you sure you dont know how much this is going to help me. freaked out and high i say okay and just rush inside.

right now after waking up being passed out i realize what i've done, gave away my bill money for this month lol.

tl;dr - i tipped my pizza delivery driver $1100 while high on brownie edibles by accident and have no money to pay for my bills now

edit: thanks for all the nice comments and the reddit gold kind stranger. i just woke up and this post just blew up. i could never call the pizza place and ask for the money back, with how happy it made the women and the fact it was my own dumb mistake it just wouldn't feel right in my head, i would rather be late on my bills and figure anything else out then do that.

i just want to say thank you to u/misterchief117 who helped me out in a insane way, i really don't deserve how nice some people in this world are.",4
"i hooked up with a guy in my airport hotel room this morning before checking out. turns out he is on the same flight as me and guess what, he's traveling with his wife and kids.. i know reddit is going to give me a lot of hate for this. this morning i was super horny and really wanted hook up with a local guy to give him bj. so i got to talking with a guy and even though he was a lot older (like late 30s-mid 40s), he had a great bod and a great dick. so i said what the hell and invited him to my hotel room. after 45min to an hour of fun, i thought i'd never see this dude again because i'm flying home this afternoon (right now).

wrong. i went to the gate when they started boarding. guess who was pre-boarding with his wife and children? you guessed it. to make matters worse, they are just a couple rows from me and i can hear all their conversations. i'm in the plane right now and he keeps texting. i am saving screen shots in case i need them in the future. i'm sitting here wondering how he was able to get away from his family that long...he was staying at the same hotel, which now just dawned on me because he made it to my room super fast. 

this is so uncomfortable.

tl;dr: hooked up with a guy at my airport hotel this am. turns out he's married, and he and his family are on my flight home.

edit: i gave him my phone number for trading texts and pics early this am. he texted me just now telling me he found me on ig and fb so he must have searched with my phone number somehow. now i definitely need leverage with the screen shots to tell him to stop contacting me.

edit 2: a) i'm male. b) the wife does not know. he texted me in the plane asking me to keep quiet. and then also wanted to stay in touch and text me later because he now knows we live in the same city (and yes you bet i saved the screen shot - saved it on the phone, on the cloud, on emails to myself) c) i knew what his dick looked like because of dick picks and bathroom mirror selfies

just wanted to respond to popular questions.

edit 3: hope you saw the screen shot, you know who you guys are. :-)",4
"by not taking off my apple watch or disabling the 911 feature and accidentally called police while i was handcuffed and being spanked by my husband and the police heard me screaming.. to begin, i'm a female bdsm practitioner. i enjoy it, and i won't apologize. (edit: that came out harsh. i'm sorry)

my husband often cuffs and whips me, and on wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. he put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my apple watch. i didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. 

so we get into it, and he's spanking me and i'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly i hear from my watch ""ma'am, i hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. we are sending someone to you. hold tight."" 

""did you call 911???"" my husband asked, ""tell them it was an accident!!""

so i tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name she said my name here? and i say yes... and she says ""we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

i said okay thank you, and i hung up.

""the police are coming.""

shit. i'm literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. within a few minutes there's a stern knock at the door. we put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.

i calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. i didn't mention the spanking.

apparently my husband did. another police officer comes in and asks about our bdsm contract. ""he told you about our contract?""

""he felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show state of mind.""

i go get our contract and showed it to the officers. after a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the apple watch if we're going to do that again.

tl;dr by accidentally calling 911 during a heavy bdsm session and they heard me screaming and sent the police.

edit: iwatch doesn't exist. <3

edit: this post is not deja vu. yes. i posted it 2 days ago, and mods took it down, asking me to repost it today. the literally hundreds of people asking about if they saw this before need to read this edit. they took it down because this happened on wednesday, and according to the rules of the subreddit, sexual content is not allowed except for on weekend, so they asked me to repost it today.

edit: holy shit. thanks for the gold!! and the front page. i'm freaking out a little because contrary to the trolls, yes this happened.",4
"by texting my pregnant wife that ""this isn't working"". my wife posted earlier today on la about this. not using my main because my fil knows it and i'm not quite ready to tell him about this.

i went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. i had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when i turned it on. most of them were asking how i could do this. i had no clue what she was talking about. she didn't answer any of my calls back.

i got home and she was packing up to leave. i'll admit it, i cried. a lot. had no clue what was happening or what i did. finally, it comes out that i texted her that i wanted a divorce. she showed me the text and i immediately realize what happened.

this morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. i texted her ""the new mirror came in! i'm going to try to put it together but i may need your help later"". i had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. i texted her, ""this isn't working, and at this point i think i need to just give up"". apparently, the first text didn't go through, just the second one. so my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while i was off thinking everything was great. she even called a divorce lawyer.

things are fine now but she's still crying off and on. she told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.

tl;dr accidentally told my wife that things weren't working, she almost left me.

edit: wow, this blew up. to address a few things that came up in the comments:

\-i usually work from home unless i need to meet with clients. i don't always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she's usually at work anyway. that's why she didn't know i was at work yesterday. i'm not allowed to have my phone on at work until my wife is 30 weeks. if my phone goes off, i could lose my job, and our health insurance.

\-my wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. that's why she had the reaction she did.

\-my comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. neither of us is mad at the other. this was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. we're fine. i posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. no need to psychoanalyze my wife or pm me about divorce. we are fine.

\-and no, we haven't put the mirror together yet. we weren't really in a ""home improvement"" mood last night.",4

"reddit not covering the sri lanka bombings the same way it covered the new zealand shootings is dirty politics.. the 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few muslims. they carried out the terrorist attacks and should be condemned as much as the white mass-shooter.

evil is evil. stop blocking breaking news.






edit: i would like to clarify. 
i am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-christian, or anti/pro islam.

i am simply stating that this act of violence as well as all other tragedies should get equal coverage, i had to go deep into reddit to find any news and its appalling. 200+ people lost their lives, and it didn't get the same attention as notre dame or new zealand massacres. 

i don't think they get the same coverage because of a fear of triggering a particular group, in this case muslims. it could have been extremist christians and i would say the same thing about them. 

humans really are the greatest risk to humanity. stop the violence and protect the planet. why is it so hard for some people to not be shitty?",6

amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. in this link(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8urhxqrq2_4&feature=youtu.be&t=480), amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. the host says ""so you raped a guy"" at 11:12(https://youtu.be/8urhxqrq2_4?t=670) and amy replies ""yeah i know. when i tell this story i say i let a cab driver finger me but really i took his hand...\sic\"". if the genders were reversed and a male comedian had confessed to stuff like this twice, he'd be in jail after public outrage. why the double standards. amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist.",6
"pedophiles who are trying to get help are brave.. it takes a lot of balls to admit that you're attracted to children. if they are trying to get help, they shouldn't be attacked by people for being a bad person. a pedophile is not a bad person until they actually commit an offence.",6
"if the father of your child is still active in their life and paying child support, you're not a single mother, you're a single woman.. i think people make a big deal about how hard it is to be a single parent when they have joint custody, their ex wants to be in their child's life, and they receive  child support and/or alimony, even though the only thing that's different between them and me is that someone sleeps in my bed at night.

eta: i didn't think this would get so much response. but since everyone is in my inbox making assumptions, let me clarify and say that a really quick internet search would have shown you i'm a 30 year old white married woman with kids 🤷🏻‍♀️ not a bitter dude who pays child support. calm down.

eta: the ""single"" in ""single parent"" refers to the number of parents in the child's life. not the marital or dating status of the individual.",6
"being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but i don't have a rally cry of support behind me. my ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. i have none of that. its not that my friends don't think i'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. what about single dads?  we do the same shit. i work and take care of my kids the same way but i don't get celebrated like i'm doing something amazing. i just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. i hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because i sounded like i wanted a cookie for being a dad. it may have sounded like i wanted credit for some shit i'm supposed to do. 

that's not the case. i've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and i'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then i play with my kid so i'm not just there on my phone. its not the same for us. we don't have the same resources. although some of you have suggested some that i hadn't heard of. 

anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and i think that may be how it came across. thanks for all your support and for making me feel like i'm doing good as a parent. 


edit 2 - well this blew up. i'd like to say that i really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. to those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why i put this in unpopular opinions. not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

as has been repeatedly pointed out, i know i'm not a full time single parent. i'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. sometimes its hard. just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. i can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props.

"i'm all for being kinky but certain 'kinks' are just a mental illness masquerading as being sexually adventurous. like if you like to be called ""daddy"" in bed it's a bit freudian, weird maybe, but i don't mind, you know? if you wanna be tied up, be tied up. have hot wax poured on your titties or snort coke of a dude's dong, i don't mind at all. 

but if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness.

"in a lot of children's shows like peppa pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids. like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. the girls save the day. i don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. like there's barbie movies too in which barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. a lot of kids shows are like this. the father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

in peppa pig, specifically, the father of peppa is an engineer. he has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. it's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. meanwhile ""mommy pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. the whole thing is pretty insidious.

social media has like minded individuals the opportunity to find each other and create a larger voice. we act like we're living in a world where the average person is this upset by everything snowflake when it reality the average person is as sick of it as everyone else. i mean how many of you have actually met one of these people? because i only hear about people getting upset with things like ""baby it's cold outside"" ",6
"parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl. i've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. my parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

these girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

i'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but i feel they still need to be taught that. 

and same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

edit; if a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. he definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. if that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

this post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. that way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",6

that is the work of a predator. maybe it isn't as bad as bill cosby, but as they both drugged people, the two can be compared. cardi b should not be a celebrated public figure.

"young men opting out of society to play video games and focus on their hobbies are ... acting completely reasonable.. there are a lot of whiny articles recently about how men don't go to university at the same rate as young women, don't work as many hours as they used to, and in general participate less in society and rather play video games or something. this naturally comes at the expense of traditional life attainments such as working yourself to death, having an insanely expensive wedding, and being the sole provider for a family that will eventually kick you out.

if you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. it's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, i think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. there just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and i can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. young men don't owe society anything. we should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

"""ok boomer"" is a completely reasonable and well-deserved response from millennials and younger generations due to the mess that the previous generations left us to deal with and their refusal to take responsibility for their actions.. facts:

•	millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did—despite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

•	cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

•	there is not one single state in the united states where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

•	student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in america, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

•	cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


for example, the bureau of census reports that the average price of a new home in june 1998 was $175,900.

according to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. the same report places the average sale price for june 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

a gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in june 2014, when adjusted for inflation. the actual national average price, as of july 2018, is $2.88 – 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

the median household income in 1998 was $38,885. the most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. the bureau of census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 – higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

this did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. ceo salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

millennials truly have it harder than our parents did.

•	we cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

•	we cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

•	we cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

and yet, boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. that we're lazy and entitled. 

no, we're not. the data shows that millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

for years now, when boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

we learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. so now we just say, ""ok boomer"".

i feel like telling people (politely) when they've used them incorrectly is the right thing to do, and saying ""language is fluid"" isn't appropriate for such a serious mistake. i think it's fine to ignore minor mistakes with punctuation and spelling, but using the wrong ""there"" actually changes the meaning of a sentence (often to nonsense), since the *wrong word* is being used.

"can marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least?. they're over-saturating the market to the extent that they're really going to go the way of the western at some point. talk about franchise fatigue. yeah, *marvel isn't immune*. they're going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

and, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren't honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest marvel releases. 

from a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren't good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. the stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

they're almost identical to the transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

no, i'm not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up rt with fresh scores for every marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it ""4 stars"" or ""fresh"" because ""it's fun, i guess"" or ""it'll work for the audience it's meant for"". these films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it's in the zeitgeist to. 

of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, marvel is the one that earned that success the least. it just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them ""new"" and ""creative"" because they change up the setting a bit. no. no, i'm sorry, that's not the picture of creative dexterity. they're safe, bland, blow em up action films.",6
"thanking god for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.. i'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but i've seen enough posts and comments online. i've had enough.

i have nothing against religion. you can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. however, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

i've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""god is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

no. i don't care how real you think he is, god had nothing to do with that. those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not god - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. god did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. god did not come down from the heavens. god did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. god did not do that surgery. *they did*. and saying that god did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. it completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *especially* if that person is not religious.

sure. you can call it a miracle or god's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. god didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. it doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

but to say that god did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. it's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. you're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. it's just wrong.

**small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: i recognize that starting this off with ""i have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. but i don't have anything against religion as a whole; i have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. it's a simple matter of a lack of respect. additionally, i don't mean the common ""thank god!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. what i mean is the active, continuous thanking of god versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking god and not those involved, or simply making god the main focus of the gratitude). also, i gotta be that person as i don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ♪siiilver and gooold♪!!",6
"i'm a guy and i wish i could be pregnant. i think pregnancy is wonderful. i know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. i supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and i helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. i know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. i wish i could do it, though.


my wife and i agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (i really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


she loved being pregnant. every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. i kissed her belly hundreds of times. and i fell in love with her all over again every time i looked at her. her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. the bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


the hardest part about it is that i'll never be able to realize this wish and i never had a choice in the matter. women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. and i don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. i know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant i'd consider it. i would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant i could get pregnant.


every guy i've ever told has either looked at me like i'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. women i've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. she knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. any guys out there agree with me?


edit: some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. i do not disagree. however, i disagree that i have an idealized view of pregnancy. just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. as i stated above, i am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

"preheating the oven is a scam ran by the government to take your money. every fucking time i buy a frozen pizza, i put that sassy bitch in right when i start the oven. why? because i've figured it out. that's right uncle sam, i'm onto you. 

the directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425f and cook for 15 minutes. my oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. so, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? no way. not chance in hell, buckaroo. when i shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, i add 3-4 minutes to compensate. this means i wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. and guess what? it tastes fucking delicious. ask any of my friends. i cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can't get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. the pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. source: i've been doing this for 12 years.

"i like being bitten by mosquitoes. it's very interesting to sit there and watch them draw out the blood. i can sometimes see them getting bigger as they go. it's a like a nature documentary right on my leg or arm. i feel nice letting that mosquito have a meal. it probably gets shoed away all the time, left to starve or worse live in fear of being killed every time it needs to eat. that poor mosquito didn't chose to eat blood, it's just hungry.",6
"the show ""friends"" is painfully unfunny and is the most overrated thing ever. every time this damn show comes on i change the channel immediately... it's just so horribly unfunny and the laugh tracks after every single line is just the worst thing ever. i cant put it into words how much i hate this show.",6
"defaming a historical figure for their ""blatant racism"" is stupid. if you were around during the 19th century, you'd be just as racist as anyone else.. so much stuff on the web these days about how so-and-so should deserve to have all of their accolades taken back because they were racist. no shit they were racist -- when slavery was common, racism was casual. it's just how things were. despite how morally superior you think you are now, you would have been raised in a household where racist comments were normal, and you would have grown up with those same views.

it's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. we would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

note: this post inspired by a twitter rant about hp lovecraft's overt racism... who the fuck cares. dude was a good writer; his views were a product of his time. get over it.

&#x200b;

edit: my inbox hurts. thanks for helping me pass the time at work today, this is fun. also, i get it, lovecraft was *particularly* racist. still a good writer though, and his views shouldn't have any bearing on whether or not we can look at him that way. separate the art from the artist.

edit 2.0: this *really* blew up... thanks to everyone who came here to actually discuss this in an intellectual capacity rather than hurling accusations of being a white supremacist at me. i've barely had time to address any comments, but i've enjoyed reading them. if you're seeing this as a ""justification of racism,"" you're exactly part of the group of problematic people i'm talking about who want to pressure wash history with a broad stroke. it's important that we take into consideration the norms of the time when discussing the merits of our forefathers. as several people have mentioned here, it's really best to grade everyone on a curve based on what was normal at the time.

"plastic bottled water in first world countries should be banned. someone made me realise today that in the west we legitimately flush our toilets with water cleaner than 90% of the world and yet we totally avoid drinking our tap water.

so many people go out and buy like bulk packages of water bottles. single use water bottles should be banned,  people should all have reusable bottles.

i mean in capital cities of australia our tap water is perfectly safe, everywhere,  even public bathrooms,  so why wouldn't you just drink it?

avoiding tap water is a first world issue,  i mean places like bali have tap water that is riddled with giardia and bulk ecoli and here we are absolutely avoiding ours when its perfectly safe (mostly,  sorry flint and parts of the usa)

"subreddits that ban users for being apart of another subreddit should be removed of reddit. lately i have been seeing posts where someone is banned for being apart of another subreddit. for example i saw someone who was subbed to the_donald was banned from offmychest and the reason the mod listed the ban for was he was apart of the_donald and they immediately thought he was a troll. i personally don't think people should be banned and stereotyped because of their political veiws from non political communities.

"we spend too much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty.. i get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and i am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  i agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  there are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  why is that?  is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  is it that no one in hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

disclaimer - i know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  i don't debate that and i have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. not only respect, but gratitude.  the world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices. but still...

&#x200b;

edit - added sources for the statistics i used, as people seem to be going down that tangent. maybe not the best sources, but the first that popped up and seemed legit. i appreciate the debate around what's defined as poverty, i think it's a good debate. but even if you only count people who are literally starving, it's still twice as many people and that doesn't invalidate my initial statement. have a nice day!

edit2 - this post was inspired by my personal perception that this issue (which generally has no relevance to me) seems to be in front of me where ever i go (on the net/media/movies) and honestly it seems completely disproportionate to the number of people actually affected. so i stated my /r/unpopularopinion(https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion). there was some good debate and the usual amount of insanity, but this post by  u/shadovvvvalker(https://www.reddit.com/user/shadovvvvalker) makes a great point that i wanted to highlight.

"telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.. there's a youtuber named nikki lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. she looks like this(https://i.imgur.com/hqmuqng.jpg).

if you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. there are rarely any other kind of comments as far as i can tell.

now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. by no societal standards in the world that i can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. she has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. she doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. but i think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. i think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. people flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

i see this as extremely strange behavior. it's almost as if nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. people know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. that's why they leave these comments.

this is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while i'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, i don't think this is a good kind of attention. i think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. it leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

it wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. all caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. it's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. it's actually kind of disgusting. i don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

really, i just feel sorry for this girl. i wonder if she understands what's going on.

edit: there are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. in case it's unclear, i'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a basis in science(https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). i understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what i'm talking about. remember that nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

edit 2: this post is really blowing up, so i wanted to share this video( https://youtu.be/8k9gg164bsw) posted by /u/thefarrquad which i think applies to this situation.",6

"reddit has become the place where the childhood bullied become the bullies. let me explain. the reddit community is the most condescending trash i have ever seen. they constantly put others down to bolster their own insecurities, subs like r/trashy serve this exact purpose of 'we're better than them.'

now for my title, in highschools of old (maybe 5-10 years ago) nerds, geeks, and just non popular people would be bullied, most of these people now make their way onto reddit.

the majority of people here are extremely critical of intelligence to the point where it could be considered bullying. you get one thing wrong they will pounce onto you and just shut everything you have to say with 'you're not smart, remember when you said this.' one of the biggest targets is the general populace, who are heavily subject to the 'superior' redditors. this is just used to treat their insecurities in saying 'we're special and different right? we're smart' no you're not, you're literally a clone of every neckbeard redditor on the site so stfu",6

"the phrase ""drugs and alcohol"" is harmful as it promotes the idea that alcohol is not a drug. alcohol is a mind altering drug that does not deserve any kind of special treatment or differentiation from other mind altering drugs. it isn't safer or otherwise more innocuous when compared to many other mind altering substances which are always discussed as being ""drugs"". by saying things like ""drugs and alcohol"", we give rise to the notion that alcohol is somehow in a different category, which i believe is harmful in a society where alcohol consumption leads to so many deaths. alcohol is a drug and should be discussed and treated as such without any special treatment.",6

i'm sure our dna is not that amazing that we need to preserve and pass on from generation to generation. it's not like if you don't pass on your genetics, world will loose something valuable. (grammar)

not reproducing but adopting can bring a huge change in this world! 

edit1: well this went out of proportion. rip my inbox. 

some clarification about my opinion. no i am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. and now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. so stop saying, hey i'm from norway and i don't want to adopt an african child. your country have zero orphanage?
it's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries.

no i'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
i'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
but if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

and someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man! 

edit 2: getting a tons messages from the  people who were adopted. 
you guys are amazing, yes some of the replies on this post are harsh. but a lot of them are positive as well. we can always look on the brighter side. love and respect to your parents who loved you and raised you like their own.

"traveling only appeals to boring people or people who haven't traveled. i've traveled everywhere. the uk, germany, france, india, bangladesh, about half of the us (including california, las vegas, new york, minneapolis, tennessee, hawaii, you get the idea) 

not once have i ever felt ""yeah, i'm experiencing something i couldn't back at home""

when you travel you have to leave most of your belongings behind, so if you have a hobby that requires any sort of specialized equipment too bad. 

i've hiked on mountains, i've swam in oceans, ive been on the london eye, i've run through every single tourist attraction there is and not once have i felt ""yeah that was worth giving 1 week of my life away""

and i'm not some anti social weirdo, i go out of my way to interact with other people. nobody is different, at the core of it people still act like people nothing more and nothing less. yeah sure there are differences, but they aren't interesting. a quick google search or a reddit post will tell you the major """"""""""""""""""culture shocks"""""""""""""""""""""" anyway. 

you wanna know my favorite part of traveling? the fucking trip. the plane ride, the train to the hotel, the taxi caught in traffic for 4 hours. unironically this is my favorite part because i get to fucking sleep

whenever someone says they love traveling i immediately think they either haven't traveled much or they are just so god damn boring they find entertainment by fucking moving the ground under their feet",6
"people are brainwashed into thinking a 40 hour, 5 day work week is an appropriate amount of time to spend working.. the government and society want to keep us working and spending as much as possible, so obviously they can tax us all along the way.  the amount people work to spend their money on the useless shit they don't need is in my opinion unbearable.  especially to anyone doing hard labor work.  people wake up and prepare for work, work all day often until the sun goes down, and by the time they are done washing up and feeding themselves, you literally have 1 or 2 hours of time each day to spend by yourselves. for anyone who plays a musical instrument or does any other practice time consuming art, your entire life consists of work and practice; leaving you a overworked, unhappy husk.

 it bugs me the fuck out that just because americans are seen as ""good"" people in todays society, we dont treat native american killing at the same level as holocaust, when it should be. 

seriously, you see media whine about asylum for immagrants, what about killing and kicking off native americans and confining them in ""reserves"" because americans were fucking shitting themselves for more land? 

people say japanese are adamant about not apologizing for what happened in wwii; what about americans to native americans?

people say there arent many female millonaires/leaders. what about native americans?

people say there are lack of black lead movies. what about native americans?

people say slavery was bad. they admit it because black people have voice in todays society. what about massive genocide native americans went through? you didnt even have a chance to work, you just fucking died.

"being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are.. people should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. my first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven't done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

edit: a couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn't be proud of your family. that doesn't apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. this extends to your community. what i am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

another point i'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. current mongols don't need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan. i don't think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler. that also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

"to girls who friendzone guys: they're not obligated to keep being your friend. i say this as a gay man who sees this with many of my female friends. 

if you have a guy friend who makes a move and you put him in the friend zone, he has every right to not stay in your life. some guys want to date you plain and simple. these guys probably had a crush on you from the start and pursued you in the hopes of a romantic relationship. these guys listened to your problems, took interest in your day, and cared about your needs to show you they can be a good partner. but it's not the same as a platonic friendship. if you friendzone a guy like this, he will do one of two things: 

1) stick around with either the hopes you'll change your mind (super common) or because he feels he can quickly move on and be genuine friends (rare)

2) not talk to you again because he doesn't want to hear about you seeing other guys or hear about your boy problems.
