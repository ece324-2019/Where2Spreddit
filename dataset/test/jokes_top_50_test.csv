"a new navy recruit has his first day on the submarine.... he speaks with the officer, who assigns him his post.

""go stand at the periscope entry-way, and make sure no unauthorized personnel touch the periscope.""

the recruit follows orders, and stands by the periscope. after 15 minutes, the officer stops by.

""son i'm changing your post to the mess hall. go in there and start washing some dishes.""

the recruit obeys, and heads to the mess hall. he's cleaned about 3 dishes when the officer walks up again.

""listen here recruit, your new post is in the supply room. i need you to make sure everything is strapped down tight, in case of rough waters.""

the recruit again follows orders, and heads off to the supply room. there, he sees a crewman, moving some boxes.

""hey there,"" says the recruit. ""is it normal to keep getting reassigned to new posts all day? i haven't kept one position for more than 15 minutes!""

the crewman says ""oh yeah- this sub is full of reposts."" ",0

"this is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory. a male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  the male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. he said to the female whale, ""lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" they tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. the male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" at this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""look,"" she said, ""i went along with the blow job, but i absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

"still my favorite joke i ever made up. :). a monocle walks into a bar. after a few drinks he starts to feel pretty good (and a little uncoordinated). he reaches for a cigarette, but the bartender stops him. ""sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. you'll have to step outside to smoke.""

so the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. they bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. they try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.

the bartender looks down on this travesty and shakes his head. ""hey you two!"" he shouts. ""stop making spectacles of yourselves!""",0

"a lost dog strays into a jungle. a lion sees this from a distance and says with caution ""this guy looks edible, never seen his kind before"".. so the lion starts rushing towards the dog with menace. the dog notices and starts to panic but as he's about to run he sees some bones next to him and gets an idea and says loudly ""mmm...that was some good lion meat!"". 

the lion abruptly stops and says "" woah! this guy seems tougher then he looks, i better leave while i can"". 

over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. so the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily ""get on my back, we'll get him together"". 

so they start rushing back to the dog. the dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. he then gets another idea and shouts ""where the hell is that monkey! i told him to bring me another lion an hour ago...""

his wife is puzzled and asks if hes been to this club before.

""oh no,"" says dave. ""hes on my bowling team.""

when they are seated, a waitress asks dave if hed like his usual and brings over a budweiser.

his wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and says,""how did she know that you drink budweiser?""

""shes in the ladies bowling league, honey. we share lanes with them.""

a stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around dave, and says ""hi davey. want your usual table dance, big boy?""

daves wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club.

dave follows and spots her getting into a cab. before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her.

he tries desperately to explain how the stripper must have mistaken him for someone else, but his wife is having none of it.

she is screaming at him at the top of her lungs, calling him every name in the book.

so jim asks, ""well, what does that have to do with me? how can i help?""

"serious just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive.. a few days ago i was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

i decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until i decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

here's the joke i told:

""what do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

throw your washing (laundry if you're american) in.""

one of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. when i asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

obviously i felt mortified as i didn't know about it, and said ""i'm so sorry to hear that. did he drown?""

""no,"" replied the guy. ""he choked on a sock.""",0
