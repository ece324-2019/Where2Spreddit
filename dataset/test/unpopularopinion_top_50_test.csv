"eating cereal with water is better than with milk. i am a true believer that cereal with water is better. the taste of milk conflicts with the taste of the cereal, whereas water does not. while still getting the same texture, water does not ruin the taste of cereal. my friends crucified me when i told them this...so for this reason i am coming here in search of others who share my beliefs of water being better than milk. 

edit: i pour the cereal before the water, for those asking

"reddit not covering the sri lanka bombings the same way it covered the new zealand shootings is dirty politics.. the 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few muslims. they carried out the terrorist attacks and should be condemned as much as the white mass-shooter.

evil is evil. stop blocking breaking news.






edit: i would like to clarify. 
i am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-christian, or anti/pro islam.

i am simply stating that this act of violence as well as all other tragedies should get equal coverage, i had to go deep into reddit to find any news and its appalling. 200+ people lost their lives, and it didn't get the same attention as notre dame or new zealand massacres. 

i don't think they get the same coverage because of a fear of triggering a particular group, in this case muslims. it could have been extremist christians and i would say the same thing about them. 

humans really are the greatest risk to humanity. stop the violence and protect the planet. why is it so hard for some people to not be shitty?",6
"amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist and thus deserves to be in jail see below. edit: thanks for the awards. i hope this post can raise some awareness.

in a speech schumer gave(https://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) at the  ms. foundation for women's gloria awards and gala, she confessed to having sex with a college friend that was so drunk, he couldn't even get an erection let alone consent to having sex. ""and then came the sex, and i use that word very loosely. his penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand"". sex without consent is the very definition of -rape-.

amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. in this link(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8urhxqrq2_4&feature=youtu.be&t=480), amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. the host says ""so you raped a guy"" at 11:12(https://youtu.be/8urhxqrq2_4?t=670) and amy replies ""yeah i know. when i tell this story i say i let a cab driver finger me but really i took his hand...\sic\"". if the genders were reversed and a male comedian had confessed to stuff like this twice, he'd be in jail after public outrage. why the double standards. amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist.",6
"pedophiles who are trying to get help are brave.. it takes a lot of balls to admit that you're attracted to children. if they are trying to get help, they shouldn't be attacked by people for being a bad person. a pedophile is not a bad person until they actually commit an offence.",6
"if the father of your child is still active in their life and paying child support, you're not a single mother, you're a single woman.. i think people make a big deal about how hard it is to be a single parent when they have joint custody, their ex wants to be in their child's life, and they receive  child support and/or alimony, even though the only thing that's different between them and me is that someone sleeps in my bed at night.

eta: i didn't think this would get so much response. but since everyone is in my inbox making assumptions, let me clarify and say that a really quick internet search would have shown you i'm a 30 year old white married woman with kids ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not a bitter dude who pays child support. calm down.

"being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but i don't have a rally cry of support behind me. my ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. i have none of that. its not that my friends don't think i'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. what about single dads?  we do the same shit. i work and take care of my kids the same way but i don't get celebrated like i'm doing something amazing. i just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. i hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because i sounded like i wanted a cookie for being a dad. it may have sounded like i wanted credit for some shit i'm supposed to do. 

that's not the case. i've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and i'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then i play with my kid so i'm not just there on my phone. its not the same for us. we don't have the same resources. although some of you have suggested some that i hadn't heard of. 

anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and i think that may be how it came across. thanks for all your support and for making me feel like i'm doing good as a parent. 


edit 2 - well this blew up. i'd like to say that i really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. to those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why i put this in unpopular opinions. not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

as has been repeatedly pointed out, i know i'm not a full time single parent. i'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. sometimes its hard. just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. i can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props.

"i'm all for being kinky but certain 'kinks' are just a mental illness masquerading as being sexually adventurous. like if you like to be called ""daddy"" in bed it's a bit freudian, weird maybe, but i don't mind, you know? if you wanna be tied up, be tied up. have hot wax poured on your titties or snort coke of a dude's dong, i don't mind at all. 

but if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness. 

calling someone out for basically being into pedophilia or bestiality and hiding it as a fetish or kink that should be understood and respected isn't 'kinkshaming', it's just being a concerned citizen and perfectly fine.",6

"in a lot of children's shows like peppa pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids. like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. the girls save the day. i don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. like there's barbie movies too in which barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. a lot of kids shows are like this. the father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

in peppa pig, specifically, the father of peppa is an engineer. he has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. it's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. meanwhile ""mommy pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. the whole thing is pretty insidious.

social media has like minded individuals the opportunity to find each other and create a larger voice. we act like we're living in a world where the average person is this upset by everything snowflake when it reality the average person is as sick of it as everyone else. i mean how many of you have actually met one of these people? because i only hear about people getting upset with things like ""baby it's cold outside"" ",6
"parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl. i've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. my parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

these girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

i'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but i feel they still need to be taught that. 

and same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

edit; if a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. he definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. if that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

this post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. that way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",6

that is the work of a predator. maybe it isn't as bad as bill cosby, but as they both drugged people, the two can be compared. cardi b should not be a celebrated public figure.

as a stripper, you are already making way more than minimum wage. if you can't survive off of a stripper's salary, you should go ahead and crawl back into your mother's womb because most people survive off less.

"young men opting out of society to play video games and focus on their hobbies are ... acting completely reasonable.. there are a lot of whiny articles recently about how men don't go to university at the same rate as young women, don't work as many hours as they used to, and in general participate less in society and rather play video games or something. this naturally comes at the expense of traditional life attainments such as working yourself to death, having an insanely expensive wedding, and being the sole provider for a family that will eventually kick you out.

if you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. it's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, i think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. there just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and i can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. young men don't owe society anything. we should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

"""ok boomer"" is a completely reasonable and well-deserved response from millennials and younger generations due to the mess that the previous generations left us to deal with and their refusal to take responsibility for their actions.. facts:

‚Ä¢	millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did‚Äîdespite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

‚Ä¢	cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

‚Ä¢	there is not one single state in the united states where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

‚Ä¢	student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in america, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

‚Ä¢	cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


for example, the bureau of census reports that the average price of a new home in june 1998 was $175,900.

according to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. the same report places the average sale price for june 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

a gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in june 2014, when adjusted for inflation. the actual national average price, as of july 2018, is $2.88 ‚Äì 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

the median household income in 1998 was $38,885. the most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. the bureau of census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 ‚Äì higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

this did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. ceo salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

millennials truly have it harder than our parents did.

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

and yet, boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. that we're lazy and entitled. 

no, we're not. the data shows that millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

for years now, when boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

we learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. so now we just say, ""ok boomer"".

"can marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least?. they're over-saturating the market to the extent that they're really going to go the way of the western at some point. talk about franchise fatigue. yeah, *marvel isn't immune*. they're going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

and, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren't honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest marvel releases. 

from a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren't good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. the stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

they're almost identical to the transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

no, i'm not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up rt with fresh scores for every marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it ""4 stars"" or ""fresh"" because ""it's fun, i guess"" or ""it'll work for the audience it's meant for"". these films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it's in the zeitgeist to. 

of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, marvel is the one that earned that success the least. it just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them ""new"" and ""creative"" because they change up the setting a bit. no. no, i'm sorry, that's not the picture of creative dexterity. they're safe, bland, blow em up action films.",6
"thanking god for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.. i'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but i've seen enough posts and comments online. i've had enough.

i have nothing against religion. you can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. however, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

i've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""god is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

no. i don't care how real you think he is, god had nothing to do with that. those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not god - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. god did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. god did not come down from the heavens. god did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. god did not do that surgery. *they did*. and saying that god did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. it completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *especially* if that person is not religious.

sure. you can call it a miracle or god's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. god didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. it doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

but to say that god did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. it's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. you're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. it's just wrong.

**small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: i recognize that starting this off with ""i have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. but i don't have anything against religion as a whole; i have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. it's a simple matter of a lack of respect. additionally, i don't mean the common ""thank god!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. what i mean is the active, continuous thanking of god versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking god and not those involved, or simply making god the main focus of the gratitude). also, i gotta be that person as i don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ‚ô™siiilver and gooold‚ô™!!",6
"i'm a guy and i wish i could be pregnant. i think pregnancy is wonderful. i know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. i supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and¬†i helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. i know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. i wish i could do it, though.


my wife and i agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (i really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


she loved being pregnant.¬†every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. i kissed her belly hundreds of times. and i fell in love with her all over again every time i looked at her. her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. the bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


the hardest part about it is that i'll never be able to realize this wish and i never had a choice in the matter. women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. and i don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. i know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant i'd consider it. i would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant i could get pregnant.


every guy i've ever told has either looked at me like i'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. women i've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. she knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. any guys out there agree with me?


edit: some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. i do not disagree. however, i disagree that i have an idealized view of pregnancy. just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. as i stated above, i am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

the directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425f and cook for 15 minutes. my oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. so, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? no way. not chance in hell, buckaroo. when i shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, i add 3-4 minutes to compensate. this means i wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. and guess what? it tastes fucking delicious. ask any of my friends. i cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can't get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. the pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. source: i've been doing this for 12 years.

so nice try, mr. president. i know you want all of us to cook our pizzas for that extra 10 minutes to make us use a little extra electricity. maybe it isn't significant if one person cooks their frozen italian love pie for 10 extra minutes, but you're a thinker. you're looking at the grand  scheme of things. millions of people cooking their pizza for 10 minutes extra? that's straight theft, my man. and i ain't giving in to that scheme .",6
"america should forget their tipping culture and just set a minimum wage for servers.. as someone outside the us, this is something i couldn't understand with your country (aside from your healthcare and guns). yes, i know that servers aren't getting paid properly, that's why the tips. but why don't you guys standardise the wages of your servers so even if the servers have lots of karens (who don't tip well) during the day, they're still paid by the hours of their service.

"reddit culture is cringey and fucking annoying.. the ""thank you kind stranger"" shit, the comment threads that build on some reference or pun where everyone adds some kind of variation, the replies that are just a subreddit name like r/rareinsults and r/whoosh, all of it is fucking annoying. it's like watching poorly socialized people attempt to make some kind of ""cool kids club"".

i'd like to add a point that u/jarrodnb brought up. reddit's attachments to memes and sayings lasts for far too long, which ends up making them unfunny, namely ""oof"", ""yikes"", and ""le"" (""doggo"" and ""pupper"" fall in there too, but they weren't funny to begin with). expanding on what i said in my reply to their comment, it's a weird communal flocking to what's trending in an attempt to be a cool, trendy person; but it's usually after the place the meme came from has moved on. it's wanting to be hip without actually expending the effort to find and participate in the source.",6

"defaming a historical figure for their ""blatant racism"" is stupid. if you were around during the 19th century, you'd be just as racist as anyone else.. so much stuff on the web these days about how so-and-so should deserve to have all of their accolades taken back because they were racist. no shit they were racist -- when slavery was common, racism was casual. it's just how things were. despite how morally superior you think you are now, you would have been raised in a household where racist comments were normal, and you would have grown up with those same views.

it's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. we would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

note: this post inspired by a twitter rant about hp lovecraft's overt racism... who the fuck cares. dude was a good writer; his views were a product of his time. get over it.

edit: my inbox hurts. thanks for helping me pass the time at work today, this is fun. also, i get it, lovecraft was *particularly* racist. still a good writer though, and his views shouldn't have any bearing on whether or not we can look at him that way. separate the art from the artist.

edit 2.0: this *really* blew up... thanks to everyone who came here to actually discuss this in an intellectual capacity rather than hurling accusations of being a white supremacist at me. i've barely had time to address any comments, but i've enjoyed reading them. if you're seeing this as a ""justification of racism,"" you're exactly part of the group of problematic people i'm talking about who want to pressure wash history with a broad stroke. it's important that we take into consideration the norms of the time when discussing the merits of our forefathers. as several people have mentioned here, it's really best to grade everyone on a curve based on what was normal at the time.

"we spend too much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty.. i get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and i am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  i agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  there are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  why is that?  is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  is it that no one in hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

disclaimer - i know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  i don't debate that and i have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. not only respect, but gratitude.  the world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices. but still...

edit - added sources for the statistics i used, as people seem to be going down that tangent. maybe not the best sources, but the first that popped up and seemed legit. i appreciate the debate around what's defined as poverty, i think it's a good debate. but even if you only count people who are literally starving, it's still twice as many people and that doesn't invalidate my initial statement. have a nice day!

"telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.. there's a youtuber named nikki lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. she looks like this(https://i.imgur.com/hqmuqng.jpg).

if you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. there are rarely any other kind of comments as far as i can tell.

now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. by no societal standards in the world that i can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. she has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. she doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. but i think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. i think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. people flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

i see this as extremely strange behavior. it's almost as if nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. people know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. that's why they leave these comments.

this is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while i'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, i don't think this is a good kind of attention. i think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. it leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

it wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. all caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. it's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. it's actually kind of disgusting. i don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

really, i just feel sorry for this girl. i wonder if she understands what's going on.

edit: there are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. in case it's unclear, i'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a basis in science(https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). i understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what i'm talking about. remember that nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

the majority of people here are extremely critical of intelligence to the point where it could be considered bullying. you get one thing wrong they will pounce onto you and just shut everything you have to say with 'you're not smart, remember when you said this.' one of the biggest targets is the general populace, who are heavily subject to the 'superior' redditors. this is just used to treat their insecurities in saying 'we're special and different right? we're smart' no you're not, you're literally a clone of every neckbeard redditor on the site so stfu",6

edit1: well this went out of proportion. rip my inbox. 

some clarification about my opinion. no i am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. and now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. so stop saying, hey i'm from norway and i don't want to adopt an african child. your country have zero orphanage?
it's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries.

no i'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
i'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
but if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

and someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

you guys are amazing, yes some of the replies on this post are harsh. but a lot of them are positive as well. we can always look on the brighter side. love and respect to your parents who loved you and raised you like their own.

"traveling only appeals to boring people or people who haven't traveled. i've traveled everywhere. the uk, germany, france, india, bangladesh, about half of the us (including california, las vegas, new york, minneapolis, tennessee, hawaii, you get the idea) 

not once have i ever felt ""yeah, i'm experiencing something i couldn't back at home""

when you travel you have to leave most of your belongings behind, so if you have a hobby that requires any sort of specialized equipment too bad. 

i've hiked on mountains, i've swam in oceans, ive been on the london eye, i've run through every single tourist attraction there is and not once have i felt ""yeah that was worth giving 1 week of my life away""

and i'm not some anti social weirdo, i go out of my way to interact with other people. nobody is different, at the core of it people still act like people nothing more and nothing less. yeah sure there are differences, but they aren't interesting. a quick google search or a reddit post will tell you the major """"""""""""""""""culture shocks"""""""""""""""""""""" anyway. 

you wanna know my favorite part of traveling? the fucking trip. the plane ride, the train to the hotel, the taxi caught in traffic for 4 hours. unironically this is my favorite part because i get to fucking sleep

"being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are.. people should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. my first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven't done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

edit: a couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn't be proud of your family. that doesn't apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. this extends to your community. what i am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

another point i'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. current mongols don't need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan. i don't think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler. that also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.
