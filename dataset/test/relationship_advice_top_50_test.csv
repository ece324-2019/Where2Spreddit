"update: my (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before i get married.. first of all thank you so much for all the replies, i didnt think this would get so big. i have read pretty much all of them (special shout out goes to the person who says this was fake solely on the fact that i write like a man, whatever that means xd)

also thanks for all the gold and silver, it's appreciated although if you wanna spend money give it to charity or something.

&#x200b;

i went and talked to him this morning i told him that his father is not going to look at me and he needs to respect that. he was adamant that it needs to happen and accused me about lying about my virginity. i was trying to be calm and rational but he was not having it and just became more and more angry. i told him if he really loved me he would stand by me on this and tell his father no to which he slapped me and said he didnt need to prove anything.

so i ended it and left him. i am currently back at my friends house being miserable and eating pizza which is pretty fun. 

so yup. thanks everyone :)",8
"update my 32m best friend 30 f asked if i would be her sperm donor for her surrogate, i am in love with her but sje has no idea.. i appreciate all the feedback, most of you were nice. there was a few idiots telling me i needed to be alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. 

anyway the consensus with my rl friends was i needed to tell her. we do brunch on saturdays because she does yoga sundays so we met up this morning. 

i could barely eat and she could tell something was up. she got worried thinking i was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

i sat her down and told her everything how i realized i was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. i told her that i never said anything because i did not want to jeopardize our friendship. her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

i honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and i honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. she half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

we hugged and i told her that there is no one on this earth i would want to have a child with but her. we talked for hours ,in fact i just got home. we have decided that we want to focus on us for now. i want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

i know that this isn't a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

however i am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

thank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her

"i (m28) broke up with my ex-fiancee (f27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. i am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.. hey guys,

i need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

a little background: 

me and my ex-fiancee had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. i was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. she was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

back in april of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. i once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

it all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in june because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. that was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. i didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. i fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. it made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

everything was kinda ok until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. the picture was of my ex-fiancee at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. i fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. she was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

when i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

she cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. i was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

i told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. she begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

i did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancee had comitted suicide. her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

i am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancee friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

i am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",8
"mom had an affair 18 years ago, i 18m am the product of it. my dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.. update 3:

hey guys, and update has already been posted here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccpwcu/update_mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am/). please don't message me so angrily any more.

update 2:

sorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.

nothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. regardless, i think i will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.

my sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and i have her support.

i promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now i need to support my grandma.

thank you again to everyone.

\-

update:

sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but i chickened out half way through what i had to say :(

the good news is that i am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

thank you for all your support, everyone, i will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

my grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

i will let you know how i manage.

thank you again.

\-

pretty much the title. i have no idea how to process all this, and i am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

both my older brother and sister went to the same college. my brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. both had their college paid by our dad. dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

my brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

my sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

i got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. i always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

instead i was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how i am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. he said it was never is place to say anything since i am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

apparently my grandparents know i am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

my siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as i am because there was never a hint of anything being off. i might be naive, but i always thought i had a great relationship with my dad. we go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when i had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. i never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. i mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. it's a story he tells from time to time. he likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

my mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

i feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. i am not even sure i will be able to go to college any more, i always assumed my parents will pay for it. i never had a job, and i am not sure what job i can even get to support me through college, i have no idea how to apply for loans.

all my mom has done is cry and apologize. but nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

i don't even know if i am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, i feel shame leaving my room, and if i will be asked to move out i don't know where to go. i don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

i am angry at my mom, i am confused about where i stand with my dad. there's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. i feel rejected and i have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

anyone have any idea what to do here?

do i apologize to my dad? what do i say to him?

idk, i've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. i have no idea what to do.

\-

edit: comments are coming in faster than i can reply, but i am making a list with all the advice about financial aid, health insurance, getting my own phone plan, etc, things i didn't even think about before. thank you everyone.

i will try to answer as much as i can, but there's more comments than i can handle.",8
"happy update: it has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34f) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. i (35m) am seriously considering a divorce.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b1982e/it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we\_learned\_that\_my/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1982e/it_has_been_7_months_since_we_learned_that_my/)

hi all. first off, i want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or pm. i am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support i received and i spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as i read your messages and well wishes.

the night after i wrote my original post, i wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/witchy_woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

""dear \wife's name\,

i love you more than you can imagine and the most i want in this world is for you to be happy. i understand that as a man i probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. i'm doing my best to help you but the fact that you won't help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. i honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don't make an effort to get better. however, i want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. i'm ready to talk whenever you are.

with all my love,

\my name\""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

i put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. the next morning (march 16th), i woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed oj. when i walked into the bedroom with her food, i saw her reading my letter. when she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. full on, niagara falls level crying. i hugged her tighter, told her ""i love you so, so, much"", and started crying too. i honestly don't know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. it could've been 10 minutes, it could've been an hour, i didn't care. when she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. reddit, you guys don't know how thrilled and proud i was when i heard those words. she then asked me if we could go on a trip to japan because in her words ""i really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.""

i was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. she's always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels i saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. we just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. we have a 5am uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

we're not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

edit: i'm going to bed. thank you to everyone who followed my story and offered their well wishes.",8
"update i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i talked to her.. i would like to preface this post with an apology. i know it has been nearly three weeks since i last posted. to be honest, in no world did i ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. i've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original it, i have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. for that, i am sorry.

for the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. it is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

for the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a greek tragedy, i apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

now to start where things left off.

after making my original post, i combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a plan b box and thrown it into the garbage. a lot of them made sense. my greatest hope was that it might have just been old. maybe it was before we even met. clinging to that, i hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. i'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what i would say in response, and what i would do. i memorized them all.

on the evening after i made my original post, i called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. as i had practiced, i asked her the following question:

>hey, i'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up plan b box in the garbage? 

the second the words ""plan b"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. she was completely lost for words. i already knew at that point. i retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>why was there a torn up plan b box in the garbage? you know i had a vasectomy. 

she just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. then she looked to the floor. then she started weakly sobbing. 

this was not on the flowchart. i had no idea how to respond. i thought if i let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. finally i prompted her with another question:

>are you crying because you did something you regret?

she shook her head violently. i was so concerned because i thought something horrendous might have happened.

she abruptly shrieked ""i'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" i have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

so i prompted her again. 

>just tell me why it was there. you don't have to hide anything from me.

she yelled at me again. repeatedly. ""if you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""fuck you for not trusting me.""

this line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. i refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, i wasn't budging an inch. she then informed me that either i had to leave or she would leave. since i doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), i agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. i went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

the following night, i texted her asking if she was ready to talk. she was not. instead, she gave me an ultimatum: i had to 1 apologize, 2 promise to never bring it up again, and 3 learn to trust her completely. only then would she allow me back home. if i couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

i have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. i am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. i currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. the lawyer will probably tell me i'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

there is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. i am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. none of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. i'm holding off on saying anything until i'm calm and rational and won't do something i'll regret in the future.

**tl;dr** yes, she cheated, yes, the marriage is over, and yes, i feel awful about it. ",8
"update my grandparents don't approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don't want me (f24) to marry him (26). i don't know what to do, since i don't want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).. hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my previous post. (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

it was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that i come clean to sam. i did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. i asked him how he's taking it so well and he told me he's experienced something similar before. 

his cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. he told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. they wouldn't allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he ""got his head straight"". 

he then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. he told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

sam joked that he wouldn't give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they'd be in love with him. 

well i think it's working. sam and i have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night i notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. sam and my grandpa are both ww2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with sam. 

i decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. i got there before sam, and i could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought i had come alone_. they asked where sam was, when he was coming etc. then they said we wouldn't start eating until he arrived. 

i'm just so incredibly happy that i get to keep both relationships.",8
"update : wife (38f) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. it's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks i am going to abandon her and ""our twins"". it has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.

^((original post)(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

i called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . he seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  he said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. i sat her down and we talked. all she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . i tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. i asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. she said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . so i did. she kept changing subjects or saying that "" a mother just feels it. you wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". she got very agitated and was crying telling me that if i wanted to leave her i should simply leave but i shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200b;

somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

after she did i went on her computer. i do **never** snoop on her. but i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . oh boy. she was in 2 facebook groups. one was a normal mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. in the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. they were feeding in each others delusions. a woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. my wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. so many women were making her fear that i would leave. saying things like men can not stick to a woman . many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

i was really fucking scared. i researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of schizophrenia(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3361851/). so to say the least i could not sleep. i was and am still very afraid of losing her. she woke up and i tried to act like nothing was wrong . we were going to the doctor. and it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. she was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. he was really tactful when talking to my wife. he tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. we tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. she got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . she began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . we could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . she could not breathe. the doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . she had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. did an ekg to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

at that point i really had no other option than to inquire about involuntary commit. so i could not do it myself . i needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . after that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". so far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . my wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. when i last her she was furious with me. she said i was taking away her freedom which i am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. she is so mad at me. i feel like i am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. i love her with all my heart. i am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . i feel like i failed to protect her. at this point i am just rambeling . sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . i feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : i will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! when i gave my vows i meant trough illness and bad times. i am not only on the ride for the good times. if you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? i am here to stay. i will not divorce her. she is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. i hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

sorry for the rant. but if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. i understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it beginns to mess with their mental health  and i respect that but i won't do that.

edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. she was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

i don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as i was so distraught. but i was not a sedative. i think it was something along the lines of valium or baldrian. over the counter stuff mostly.

she has family. she is estranged from most of them. her sister is now at our place to help.

also refrain from such stupid comments like ""i'll bet she will leave bro. she is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. just seems like you want me to divorce. get a life.",8
"my (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before i get married.. my fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. we decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. everything was going great. he seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

i am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and i wasn't fussed so i agreed to saving it. he has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. i laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. no turns out he was dead serious. he wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know i am still 'pure'.

i told him fat chance i am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. he said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much i love him and that i have nothing to hide anyway as i am still a virgin. i left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

i want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. but at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and i dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

"i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.. throwaway, because reasons.

i don't even know where to start with this. i'm dumbfounded. she just stormed out the house and i'm sitting on the bed asking myself a lot of questions.

i live a pretty normal life, and i thought so did my girlfriend. we've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. we started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. she would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. i'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. i always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, i wouldn't stop her.

this is where it takes a turn for the weird. i keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. i also go to the gym frequently, so i always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. i never kept count, but i know by just a visual glance i several pairs. this morning when i went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, i noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. i went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so i checked the washing machine and dryer. both were empty. i couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. so, i did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. after all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. she went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. when i went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. i told her i wasn't mad, i was just looking for my socks. she kinda mumbled ""i'll don't know."" i still wasn't mad, of course, but i was super confused. socks just don't disappear. so i asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""i'll buy you new ones!""

the first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. i thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so i joked with her about ruining my socks. wrong. thing. to. say. she started immediately crying. like, full on sobbing. at this point i don't care about the socks anymore, i want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. i sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. she just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. i tried assuring her again it was okay. even went so far as to say i would buy new socks and she didn't have to. i sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. i told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

on my way out i grabbed the garbage to take outside. when i got outside i lifted the lid off the garbage can and i noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. i could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. since i was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, i wanted to see for myself. i opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. there, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. as soon as the smell hit me i knew it was poop.

1. we don't own any pets.
2. we don't have any kids.
3. whose poop was on my socks?

work could wait. i couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. i grabbed the bag and walked back inside. as soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. she said i shouldn't be going through the garbage and that i was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. i asked her to calm down and that i just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. i wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. that's when it clicked. i don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. i asked her ""is this your poop?"" she started sobbing again and ran out of the house. i didn't go after her this time.

so, now i am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. the only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. i sent her text asking her to come back. she hasn't responded yet. i don't even know what i'm going to say when (if) she gets back.

update:

i had to leave for work and am now at work. yes, i threw away the bag of poopy socks. she texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. she said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to not bring it up in person. i'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as i can. her responses are super short, but i'm getting the idea.

i flat out asked her if it was a fetish. it is not a fetish. she confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. i found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. i had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? she thought i would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. she admitted she has done this for a long time. her reasoning, as best as i can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in any way. she uses socks because it covers her entire hand. after she's done with them, she throws them away. she used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

so, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. it could be worse, i guess. i hope we can laugh about this later. i'm trying to find the humor in it now, but i'm still weirded out.

"me 52m just found out at least 4 of my 5 children 33f30f28m24f14f are not mine. wife 51f wont say anything.. ***note: please do not use ancestry kits as a paternity test. if you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local medlab (medical lab). ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. in my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.***

--------------

i apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. i posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested i ask on r/parenting. but i also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so i want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

first of all, i'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, i am not really in the best state of mind. my world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. i just want to write as much context as possible so i can get the best advice needed. for obvious reasons, i am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

background: i met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. we have 5 beautiful children together - really, i consider them a total blessing regardless of what i'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago i thought that we had the perfect marriage. we were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, i feel like i've done everything a loving husband should do. i am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant i work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but i want to stress that i've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. and never in a million years would i ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. and the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested i was not her father. she confided this to me privately, showing me the results and i could tell she was visibly upset by this. of course, the first thing i did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and i'll always love her unconditionally. but secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. it comes back and i am indeed not her biological father.

this news really broke me. i'm ashamed to say i broke down in tears in front of my daughter. the combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset i was making my daughter by how i was reacting. i really wish i had kept it in for her sake, but i didn't.

following this i asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. i wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, i could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. however i didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really i didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

we tell the other three what has happened, i reassure them that i love them unconditionally and that i'll always be there dad, but that i need to know how long this has been going on. god, i can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. they didn't care i wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken i was. i feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

so we have paternity tests for each of the three done. not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. which somehow made it worse. it's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? i can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

so i confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. she doesn't confess. she doesn't even take it seriously. she says the tests must be flawed. all four? how the hell am i supposed to take that seriously?

i keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. when i bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""we've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. but how am i supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

now that i have rambled and explained what has happened. i guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. how can i reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? i feel like the way i have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times i reassure them.

2. how do i handle my youngest daughter? i feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and i will need to tell my daughter something. i don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but i also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. is there anyway, anyway at all, you think i could or should save my marriage? i've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. i know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. if there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, i want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. wife refuses to confess her infidelity. unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

edit: thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. i have not replied to as many comments as i should have, but i've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. i'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. again, i can't begin to thank you for all your support. if this is resolved i might post an update, but if she continues to lie then i don't think i'll bother, as there's not much more i can add. from the advice in this and the r/parenting thread i've decided to:

1. get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. tell my youngest of the situation. ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. it will be entirely her decision.

4. i'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. my mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and i owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), i have not ruled out some form of counselling. but at the moment i think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

once again i'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

edit2: i guess i should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **how did the ancestry results suggests i wasn't her father?** my family is entirely irish. no relatives outside of ireland other than my immediate family, and i even have the stereotypical red hair. my daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the british isles/western europe/northern europe. that's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **which two children share the same father?** my two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **how did your wife conceive your children?** our eldest daughter was not planned. all the others were planned. each time we conceived several months after we started trying. our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. she was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually i agreed. she was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **are you infertile?** i don't know. i've never had a fertility test done. but the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that i might be. i will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

"31m husband cheated on 27f me with his fit and skinny gym friend. i came home from work early (i'm an ob nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. at that point, i sort of already knew what i'd be walking into. my husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. she's beautiful and thin and everything i am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. so, i talked to him about it. he encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

i walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. they were having sex. in our bed. with a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. i silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and i've returned to the hospital. he called me asking why i wasn't home and i told him my shift is extended but in reality, i'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as i type this.

i feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. i don't even know how to proceed. on one hand i want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, i'm an ugly woman....its not like i can do better. i just want to die. i feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. advice please.

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all for the kind comments and support. please stop commenting, however. i think i've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). i don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. i still have no idea what i am going to do and i know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. he was a great husband and i can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. i don't know if i will stay, but that's all i really know right now.

&#x200b;

edit: i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while i'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how i should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. it is incredibly upsetting and i am already going through a lot. i feel i need to clarify since everyone seems to care that i had food after i found out. i had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which i had been all over the place. i had lunch at 11am and nothing else until i left. i was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. please stop harassing me about that.",8
"update: my sister (f22) ripped up my(f19) stan lee autograph and i haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (f46) is pressuring me to. thanks for the great advice. so a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

my grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

i explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who stan lee was. surprisingly she understood just perfectly. i was relieved. for a moment i thought that my dad and i would get shit from everyone.
my sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". i told her that she asked me and i just told the truth.

but what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. she again ridiculed my hobby and so on. one of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. the dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. she is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

my mom and sister came back in the morning. they didn't talk much to us . my mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. we had a short dry conversation till she asked me why i was making such a big deal about it. and i shut her up like you guys told me to. i started by explain who stan lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. it's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. you said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because i didn't lend her my jacket ""

ya'll my mom cried. she apologized profusely. she said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as i was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

my mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.",8
"update mom had an affair 18 years ago, i 18m am the product of it. my dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.. the reaction to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

i am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and i am still processing it.

i did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and i know where i now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

i am not sure i would have had the courage to say what i had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

i think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. it makes me uncomfortable knowing i am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. a lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

i have so far went through 40% (i estimate) of the comments, but i have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

the conclusion is that i am definitely going to college, it will be the college i have always wanted to go to, and i will have the same experience as my siblings. the money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

what started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then i showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

my parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when i came back pregnant"", or something like that, i was not there, this is what she told me. i guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision i ever made"" or something like that. and their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

yeah, it went downhill from there fast. shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here i am.

dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

i did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. my brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

my grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, i guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

reading the comments was a mind opening experience. i felt unprepared for the world out there. many have asked how i had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. of course i knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

i went from ""i am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and i will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. for me it was a sudden change in reality.

going through the comments i managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. really good stuff that i think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

my parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and i haven't even read all comments. i can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. i understand his reaction, but i still feel hurt by it. i understand he was not in the best place of mind, but i can't control my feelings either. we will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

mom hasn't handled everything that well. but she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

when mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. he kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. so my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (i am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

the man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. he was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, i guess he had more important things to do. but it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

and i don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. i thought about the matter the last two weeks, since i've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if i have other siblings out there.

i was suggested to go and buy a dna kit from 23andme, maybe i can find him that way, but i think i will avoid doing this specifically so i don't find him or he finds me. as far as i care, i have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

moving forward i do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like i would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

my mom admits i've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

i did learn where i stand with my family, and it's safe to say that i am loved, and i have options. i thought i am isolated, but my world is wider than i thought. grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

i think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, i think i will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

thank you.

edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.",8
"update: wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**tl;dr:** wife and i tried having a baby. my balls are blocked, surgery is in july. wife got pregnant anyways. it seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but i was told i shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. wife is celebrating, i can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. seeing doctor on monday to see if it could be mine.

update **tl;dr** at bottom

first i just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  i can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

i took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  i had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  it wasn't until i got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that i was able to try and move on.  my wife and i actually met in a soccer league we were in together. we've had so much trust for so long that i thought those fears had gone away.  it wasn't until now that i really started to feel shaken like that again.

but i didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  a few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

it's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. i didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  i got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. i couldn't wait any longer.  i made our favorite omelets, and told her i needed to talk about something.

""you know i'm not ashley, right?""

she knows me well.  ashley's my ex who cheated.

so first i apologized.  i apologized because i let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  what should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

we talked for a while.  i told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. i told her how much i loved the relationship that we've built together, and i felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  she had never given me a reason not to trust her and that i still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  she thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  she volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

but something still felt off.  i honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  normally she would have been upset that i didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling i couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

it seemed like she was saying all the right things, but i couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  maybe i'm just being paranoid.  maybe there's a gut feeling that i need to listen to.  but i ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if i still needed the surgery.

turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  i've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. so i brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. the urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that i wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. he mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

being there didn't really help.  i feel like i just got more uncertainty.  

she had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  we talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. she seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. she promised to do it in the morning.  i asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

there's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  i really couldn't put my finger on it.  we were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and i couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had sunday.

i've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but i haven't been able to focus.  we have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  this morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. we don't do that, she's never needed to before.  and i checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time thursday that i mentioned i was busy working on-site. we were supposed to go together.

i'm starting to go crazy. how do i bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  i'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  but i need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if i'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**tl;dr had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  urologist said i had obstructive azoospermia, implied i should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think i could be fertile.  wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when i can't go.  getting a second urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

update:  i've been trying to center myself.  we talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  she claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  i didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  i'm just trying to not overreact right now. i don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and im a father! or...not.  thankfully she's not working late today.  

thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

update:  i went for a long run to clear my mind.  gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  i'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why i've still been struggling personally with some of them.  regardless of what happens i'm done with any confusion left between us.

  thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

"yesterday, my(33m) wife's (34f) best friend (female) contacted me and told me that her husband and my wife were having an affair and my 3yo daughter is actually his daughter.. wife and i have been together since high school. married for 10 years. i'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. 

my wife's best friend megan and i work for the same company( different departments ). so yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. so i met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. i tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. 

according to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. she confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. 

and when i confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when i told her that megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. 

i really don't know what to do. i mean, everything was a lie right? my little girl taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. what do i live for now? i just don't know what to do. just here for some advice. i'm sorry if this felt like a rant.",8
"update: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but i'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. do i say anything?. original post is here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

so i got lots of feedback on what to do here. a good majority of the commenters told me to say something. to clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but i was never planning on doing nothing. of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. i just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which i ended up getting from alison, the third party friend. some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me i was a bad friend. some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. well all of you were somewhat right. here's how it went down: 

i messaged alison early on in the day, shortly after i made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. i said to alison that i needed to tell aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. this was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that alison came over too. we all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about mary. alison showed him the text screenshots of mary talking to her ex, and also told aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

what was the most surprising was his reaction. he took it very well. he first got very quiet, and just nodded. aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. he was not aware of the hookups, but he and mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. he told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. there were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. he knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

we started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. he cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. then he got angry. at her, and even more so at the guy. some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. we told him a million times how much better he deserved. he's definitely not going to marry her. 

thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. we saved a good man from heartbreak!

edit: jesus christ this exploded fast. thanks for all the kind words people 😅",8
"happy update: wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

i'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  i definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what i posted.  but hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes i guess.

anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  i told her everything that was going on.  the urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  i told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

she agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  she didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  she knew i was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. we talked about it sunday, but i can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  and so while she had thought we were communicating, i wasn't.  we decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

the money was the real problem for me. she agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  she offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if i really wanted we could move the money back.  she does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

we read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  it seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (cbavd) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. we're going to go back to the original specialist i was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  it turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  i told her i took off work to go with, and she was relieved i could join.

once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  after going through each thing i was just wishing i believed her a little more before. she's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. she even offered an open phone policy if i needed.  we did look at the text i had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  i declined though right now, since i don't want to be that husband.

this has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  that level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  i think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. i was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  this has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but i'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

she thought that an nipp asap was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  i'm not big on therapy, but i can probably agree that it will most likely help.

i'm feeling a little better about everything.  thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (every other comment here i read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   it's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**tl;dr  use your words. - wife and i objectively went through everything.  we both apologized, getting a nipp soon and hopefully a therapist.**

update 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/boai5u/update2_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

tldr: mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.


i just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. this will be my final update.

a few days ago, the abortion was carried out. during the weeks beforehand, my gf went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. she was also tested for any stis (she's clear!).

she went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. a few days ago it was successfully carried out.

they went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. gf said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

when she came home, she cried and cried and cried. she says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

we took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). while in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

she's amazing, man. seriously.


update on the mum! so my gf received a call from her mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

my gf and i have an agreement that if mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. in this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

i told the mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. i then said ""how jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

my gf didn't find it funny...

anyway, that's it.


good luck to everyone in their lives.

also, if you're going to message and insult me via pm, just be warned: i've killed ^a ^baby before.",8
"update i (28m) is about to propose to my gf (28f) of 7 years, but then i discovered something. need advice.. hello guys. im providing an update to my earlier post

i dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. so here's what happened. 

-she texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 pm (she's closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-i tried to facetime her 11:51 pm just to say goodnight, she didn't pick up. i tried messaging her but no response. 

remember that spare phone that's with me where her google account is logged in? i browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there's a ""google assistant"" command recorded at 11:48 pm.

i played and listened. there's her voice and a voice of another guy. they were goofing around at the google home device. so yeah. 

i confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 am.  she kept on denying she's cheating.

then i laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

she finally admitted. 

i am single.

"can't wait until thursday....my(48m) wife(44f) is going to be shocked. **\*\*\*update\*\*\***(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

so, wife and i have been together 17 years.  we are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  about two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  so off we got to the gp, who gives us a consult to a rheumatologist.  come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  fast forward to a month ago, when our north texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  she woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were huge, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  and even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  so, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  so, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from ireland and custom designed, and have words in gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  she was absolutely gutted.  i assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but i could tell, to her, it was.

begin sherlock holmes mode.  i googled until i couldn't google anymore.  i was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  i searched some more.  i finally found his personal facebook page, and i message him, and wait......and wait......

i finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  i express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  i go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  she tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

fast forward a couple of weeks.  i get a message on facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  she explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and molds in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  she sent pictures, and i confirmed that yes - those are our rings!  she said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

i open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  of our rings.  she went ahead and had her brother, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  i asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and i was allowed to keep my old one.  she told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  i asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

our ""new"" wedding bands will be here thursday.

trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has no idea any of this took place.

\*edit - i rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her i was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  the absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to not tell her as we tell each other everything.  so now i not only need to figure out how to do this, but not to spill the beans until then.  (our friends nicknamed us mickey and mallory as well as marshall and lilly from ""how i met your mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*edit 2 - i thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where i actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (va nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so always goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when i originally proposed, i waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*edit 3 - and to those of you saying ""i"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  she is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  she is the reason i breathe, and supported all of us when i went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  she is my hero.  i wake up every day to earn her all over again.  this was one small thing i was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why i have a heartbeat.  and i don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if i seem sappy.  if a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

tl;dr wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, i went hardy boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

"update: my childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while i was sleeping. she told everyone and now he's being ostracized from our friends. except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place nsfw. link to original(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cxr0sp/my_childhood_friend_went_through_my_boyfriends/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

#that ""half blurred nude"" everyone's talking about is rick astley. please, go ahead and ""depixelize"" it or whatever. 

#the other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. please read the post before commenting.

so a couple things have happened in the last few days, and i figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

first, i'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. he is just as much a victim of a crime as i am, if not more. this has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. he is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

it's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

i spoke to a lawyer...and my dad. the lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **if** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

anyways. monday, i got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. the first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". she would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

in my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. it also matters that there are two victims.

the police spoke to the people whose names i provided, most of which confirmed that sarah had shared the photos. they'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

that all made both me and john happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(all of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

so i turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. i spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. then i paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""under construction"". then i registered john and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""content pending copyrights"".

then. i posted on facebook.

""recently, someone i consider a friend broke into john's phone and stole images. she then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

not only am i disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed john in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. this person did not come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

had i actually been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. how horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

in actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

most of you know me as an entrepreneur; i own a small business, i pick up freelance jobs, i dabble in several money making ventures. none of this is a consistent income, so john and i have been brainstorming on how i could possibly generate a passive income. 

so we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. we had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and john's name was dragged through the dirt.

shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

because of this person and all who participated, i have had to out john and myself as sex workers. i've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn dad. shame on all of you.

from this point on, any person sharing these copyrighted images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

if anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

thank you.""

since then, i've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on facebook.

sarah tried to call but i hit ignore and texted her, ""you may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. she hasn't responded.

all in all, i'd say that things are looking up. sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. john's name is clear legally. important people in my life know that i'm not being abused. 

people are reaching out to john to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

so that's good, i guess.

i want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

edit: to everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

i submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. i wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

i was, an still am, angry. so i got shit done.

*edit edit*: **i am not releasing the videos.**

**another edit**: since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, this is where i got my information(https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#final edit:

this is getting out of hand so i'll be logging off. people asked for an update, so they got it.

copied from a comment i posted:

nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting sarah arrested.

my lawyer told me that, no, john could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, i could go ahead and post on facebook to try to control the narrative. 

he *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. as of now, i've achieved everything i wished to do. the police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

i don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",8
"update: my (21) little sister (12) was given 1-3 weeks to live. what can i do to make her enjoy her last days?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5idc1/my_21_little_sister_12_was_just_given_13_weeks_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

final update:

i first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. i got a lot more responses than i had thought i would, so i apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

my sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on september 1st. it's been a very hard couple of days and i've been grieving, as has my family. 

we were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. i was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. she was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

i wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. she normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. we will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

my family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. she will always be in our hearts and i know she's in a better place and not in pain. 

thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice i was given.",8
"my (20f) boyfriend (21m) wouldn't pay for my meal when i forgot my wallet. basically the title. 

usually on dates, we split the bill. i don't really care like in the past, i've paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. like we'd go back and forth. 

my current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. from the first date, he said that's how he likes to do things. i was fine with it, i didn't  really care if he wouldn't pay for me. paying on a date is sweet to me and i like it but i have my own job so it's whatever. i figured maybe he doesn't have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

anyway i didn't really have any problem with it. but we went out to some random spot. like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. so he went down the line and he got his own meal. i ordered mine and then when i went into my bag, i realized i forgot my wallet at my house. i told him that i forgot it by accident and i thought he'd offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like ""oh that sucks..."" and sat down to eat. 

i was just like what the fuck..? this guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and i paid him back through cashapp. after we ate, i lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city. 

how messed up is that? like why is he so cheap. a random stranger paid for me and he wouldn't",8
"update: i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone.. it's been a long night. thank you all for staying patient. also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

first off i just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. i'm still trying to work through all of your pm's because i'd like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. i have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. i never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it's my hope that if i can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice i used from reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon cp and find this thread (at least in canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

i also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, i understand. this is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as i wish i had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary karma, i don't. to provide proof i have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what i have written.

yesterday i was picked up by my best friend alex around 2:30. we drove around and talked for a while. i went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. we drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. david was home, in my room, and immediately i noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. he said he had to admit something to me. i prepared for him to admit to possessing cp but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn't know how to bring it up. i feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. he  said no. i asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. i don't know why i was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the cp but i really thought he'd admit to it then and there. instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn't think he would act on it. he asked me if that changed my perception of him and i said no. he grew quiet again and i left to go shower. when i came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. it was about 1030 at this point. when he left, i finally lost it and broke down. i grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. i was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

i grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency rcmp line for my city. shaking and crying i explained to the lady on the phone that i had discovered cp on my boyfriend's phone. she put me through to the report line and i spoke to another constable who told me i would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. i waited for around 10 minutes. the officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. i asked if i could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, crown counsel has clear evidence that i was not coerced into stating what i witnessed. i don't have my full licence yet and because of the late time i wasn't able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if david was there and if i could safely leave without arousing suspicion. luckily david knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so i made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. david didn't seem to question it and i waited for the officer to arrive. 

he called me from a blocked number and i walked outside and down the block to his suv. the constable and another officer greeted me,  i got into the front seat and we drove to the station. during the ride i asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. he explained that i had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying david. he said if i had taken david's phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. it was about 11:15 at this point. they placed me in an interview room and i sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. the officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. he said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 he started off by asking me details about my life, where i grew up, past employment etc. after that portion he asked me about david, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else i knew about him. i told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we'd been together but i did express that things had been moving very quickly. he agreed. he then got me to explain how i came upon the photos in question, so i did. then came the worst part. he asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos i explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. it was intense but by some grace of god i was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and i was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. he asked me if i would testify in court and i said i would. the officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. the full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

after i had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. they explained how the process would go and whether i wanted a no contact agreement.  i said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. that made sense to me so i chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

we got in the constable's car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. i told them i was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (i didn't want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. i've never felt so anxious in my life. i asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. about 15 minutes later i saw them bringing david out in handcuffs. my heart which had been dissolving in my stomach's acid all day felt completely gone. i curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told i could go back inside. after another eternity (my phone had died by this point but i know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. i was told by the officer i could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. the officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that i did a brave thing and to be well. 

i went back into my house, put planet earth on for background noise and called my other best friend paige who had been keeping up with me about this since i sent her my reddit post. we were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. it was david. he was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. my jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and i was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. paige asked me if everything was okay and i told her david had walked through the door, i would call her back. immediately david came to the bed where i was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. he said he didn't know i would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. he asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. i lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. he sobbed more and loudly said ""that isn't me, that isn't me, this isn't who i am"" and cried more and more. his body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. it was immensely difficult to witness and i wish i could have told him to get the fuck out but i just sat there immobilized, in shock. it was well close to 5 in the morning and i hadn't slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

david began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. i asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. he said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. i asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. he said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. i nodded. i asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. he admitted they were very explicit photos and i asked how he even found them; i don't recall we ever got to that. he promised me he didn't use my internet to access it but i don't really believe that. he apologized to me more times than i could count and asked if i hated him. i told him i wasn't sure that i felt hatred for him but i was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; i told him how terribly i felt betrayed and hurt and violated. i expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

then i heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. three officers were outside, two of whom i recognized from earlier and they asked me if david was here. i said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because paige had called in. i realized i had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know i was okay, bless her heart. the officers took david outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. i told them i was okay; that i would finish my discussion with him and if i had any issues i had them on speed dial. they nodded and left. 

david sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and i just sat and well, endured it. tears just ran and ran and ran from him. he said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure i expected to hear this great big apology. he said if i thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he'd done, but what i had to go through. i just nodded. there was silence for a long time, i think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. i don't know how long i stared at my tv screen that said ""are you still watching: planet earth?"" but it could have been a lifetime. i had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. i think david was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. i didn't know or care, i was just numb. i would have probably sat like that until i died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. i got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. my brain wasn't capable of thought so i stared at my tv screen until i passed out sometime around 9. 

i didn't sleep for long because when i woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. david was awake and crying still. when he realized i was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. i just stared at him. he started apologizing and apologizing more. he expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that i was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. he expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. i shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. at this point i finally asked him to leave. i told him i needed space to sort out my emotions, and i needed to get some sleep.  i asked him if he would be okay. he nodded and grabbed his things. he said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that's what i wanted him to do. i said nothing. he expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. he said i love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

i've been laying in bed since then and writing this. i just want this to be over. i just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. also i think i forgot to add that his court date is set for june. as far as sentencing, if he's found guilty of possession of child pornography i believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  i will post updates again if i feel  they are important; otherwise i will update again in june when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. i have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and i would have been so lost without some of your advice. i'll continue working on replying to your pm's, but in the meantime i think i'm going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

tldr: filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested david and seized his phone. he signed a promise to appear in court in june. he awaits sentencing.

"wife told me she wanted to experiment, i obliged, then she attempted to eat my feces.. throwaway account because my wife follows my regular account here. my (28m) wife (26f) and i have admittedly had very vanilla sex throughout our 3 year marriage. we had our first kid a year ago and it seriously slowed down our sex life. however, a little under a month ago she approached me about ""trying new things"". she has been hanging out with a group of moms in our neighborhood and one of them told her that she and her husband tried pegging and it completely transformed their marriage. my wife told me that she wanted to try pegging as well to ""spice things up"". at first i thought it was a joke, but soon realized she actually wanted to peg me. i had never done assplay before and had always lived by the philosophy that the anus is solely an exit, but my wife made it clear that this was important to her so after a few days i obliged.

that next weekend, she pegged me and everything was surprisingly enjoyable. additionally, the week following the pegging was one of the best weeks we've had together since the birth of our child. we were back to our old sex life, doing things like having sex before work and even waking each other up with head. however, that next weekend she told me she wanted to peg me again. i was slightly confused as to why this last week of sex wasn't cutting it for her, but i agreed.

this is when things took an extreme turn. during this second pegging while my wife was inside of me, she grabbed my hair, craned my neck to the right, and pressed our foreheads together. i had never seen her take control like this and thought it was very hot until she looked me in the eye and whispered ""i want your shit"". i pulled my face away and asked her to repeat and she said ""i want you to shit on me"". i pushed her off of me and asked her if she was joking and she started crying. i felt like a fucking dick because she thought i was kinkshaming her. in a way, i was because i thought the request was far too extreme. i ended up leaving for the night and stayed with one of my close friends, but didn't tell him what happened.

after that incident, my wife and i hardly talked all week unless it related to our son. at the end of the week, i asked my wife to talk about what happened. she told me again that she wanted me to shit on her and that it meant a lot to her. i thought it was sickening, but she claimed this was her deepest, darkest kink. i couldn't understand how and why my shit excited her, but she insisted that she has always wanted this.

we fought about this for about a week and after watching some scat porn and reading articles by people who also shared this kink, i tried to put myself in my wife's shoes. i told her that i will shit on her if that is what will turn her on. she was so happy and even though i was still completely nauseated by this desire, i wanted to satisfy her.

that brings us to tonight. we were having sex for the first time this week when i (regrettably) confessed to her that i had to take a shit. she perked up with a smile, sensed my discomfort, and began stroking my hair and whispering encouraging things to me. i still really didn't want to go through with it, but since i had promised her i pulled out and we ran to the bathroom.

she got into the bathtub and i hung my ass over the side of the tub. i started pushing, but unsurprisingly found it very difficult to successfully shit on my wife. i turned my head around to see my wife staring up and smiling at me waiting for me to finish. with enough time, i was finally able to get a turd to start coming out. i could hear my wife breathing heavier beneath me as my asshole started opening. however, before the turd was able to drop on her chest, i felt a sensation around my asshole.

i turned around and saw my wife - the love of my life, the mother of my son - attempting to catch my turd in her mouth as it fell out of my asshole. i was horrified that she would try to do this, and tried to pull the shit back into my body so she couldn't receive it in her mouth. seeing what looked like an attempt by her to eat my shit brought me close to throwing up.

as i clenched my buttcheeks together to try to stop the shit from reaching my wife, the clenching cut off a very small piece of my shit and i heard it land somewhere beneath me. i was too scared and disgusted to look at my wife to see what she had done with it, so i ran to the other bathroom to clean myself. as i was sitting in the other bathroom thinking about how i will ever be able to look my wife in the eye again, i heard footsteps approaching. my wife lightly knocked on the door. i didn't respond and was on the verge of throwing up the more i thought about what just happened. she walked away and then i got a text from her thanking me for fulfilling her wish and asking me to come to bed.

i've been sitting in the living room typing this for the last half hour scared to face my wife. we have plans to take our son to the zoo with another family tomorrow, but i don't think i can look at her after what she did to me. i feel deceived and violated by the woman i love and trust. during our initial conversations about this, there was never a question that my shit would go anywhere other than her chest. she knew how uncomfortable i was with this in the first place, yet she still tried to push the boundary that we had established.

i would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a similar violation of trust from a loved one. i'm turning to this sub for advice because for obvious reasons, i cannot tell anyone that knows my wife and i. i know that some of you may find this humorous, but please serious comments only - this is something that could lead to the end of our marriage.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: i didn't expect this to go to the front page, but my wife has seen the post. i have been unable to face her and there is no way to get out of going to the zoo with the other family today.  i appreciate all the serious feedback and i will update tonight.",8
"i think i got reverse catfished last night. i matched with this girl on tinder. she was significantly bigger than girls i normally date. but we have literally everything thing in common so i figured i'd give it a shot. so after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

i get there and pick a table. after waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. that's very strange so i assume she must be after something. free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, i don't know.

so i explain to her that i'm actually waiting for someone and i don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

that's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one i'm waiting for. she told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

and she was also testing me to see if i would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. so here's the thing, i don't know how i feel about being ""tested"". i don't want to live my life questioning every decision i make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

but she's also really attractive and very cool otherwise. i'm not sure how i should proceed.

edit: i didn't expect this to be downvoted so much. i guess people just prefer the standard ""i just walked in on my fiance and my father, brother, and best friend all had their penis' inside her at the same time. should i still go through with the wedding?""",8

&#x200b;

super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

i wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love i received from people in this sub i feel like the least i can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. before i begin i just want to thank everyone who gave advice, i didn't respond to everyone but i read almost every response. i stopped reading my pm's because a lot of the messages i was getting were graphic and negative but i appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and i'm sorry if i didn't respond to you. now on to the update: 

it's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. my bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time i decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. i felt like everything i needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. his sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

we spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. he told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while i was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when i first suggested it. he said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (i don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when i brought up his tattoo. obviously i knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but i must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because i never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

i was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. he regrets the tattoo and discovering i wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. he apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. he completely understood where i was coming from when i brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

i apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what i meant and was very forgiving. he apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

we then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

up until now i was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. apparently she felt like i was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

if that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. we're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

my bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. she was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. we've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

in the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. in the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. i'm a fan of this idea as well. 

as for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. i don't think he should, i feel like he's lost enough family but i'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

i think that just about wraps everything up. a huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

i mean this in the nicest way possible when i say i hope i never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - we both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. we're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",8
"my wife (30f) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. i (30m) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. our relationship is not sustainable and i need help.. hi, everyone. this will probably be lengthy as i have nobody in my life to talk to about this. this is as much an advice thread as it is a place for me vent and it feels good to air this out.

my wife suffers from intense germophobia and anxiety. we have been together for 11 years and married for 8. she has not always been like this, she was relatively normal while we dated but it started to get worse after we got married. she previously worked at a hotel as a receptionist and was occasionally required to handle and wash guest towels. well, she ended up contracting a staph infection and had to be hospitalized to have the infection drained. following this, she had to be on antibiotics for 30 days. ever since that experience, her anxiety and fear of infection has steadily grown over the years up until this point. we also have two children - 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl - and her tendencies affect them, also.

the following list is my attempt at a comprehensive germ-prevention ""standard operating procedures"" of our household:

&#x200b;

* if i touch a light switch i need to wash my hands
* if i touch a door knob i need to wash my hands
* if i go to the garage i need to take a shower before i      can sit down or do anything
* if i touch her pajamas or i touch towels then i need to      take a shower
* if i *even enter* the guest bathroom then i have      to take a shower
* if my kids enter the guest bathroom they have to have a      bath
* i am not allowed to use her toilet in the master      bathroom
* she stops up her toilet everyday and requires me to      plunge and clean it (she uses 3x as much tp as a regular person would).      the cleaning process is 3 chlorox wipes - one for the seat, one for under,      and one to use to flush it with. i have to immediately shower after this.
* if she spills excess *water* on the floor then i      have to mop it and anywhere i walked to include the **entire** house if      that is where i walked after stepping in the water.
* she goes through entire loads of her pajamas daily just      trying to change her clothes. every time she uses the toilet, she has to      change her clothes. she washes her hands and arms up to her elbows and      then her face. if she gets water on her shirt, she will change it. if,      when putting on her shirt she touches it to her body, she will change it.      if her pants touch the floor when she is putting them on, she will change      them. she discards the top shirts in her drawer every time she gets      dressed. she uses 6-7 towels after a shower, discarding half of them      because ""they touched my chest."" as you can see, this adds up      and i end up folding laundry for 60-90 minutes everyday. this doesnt      include the time it takes to actually change it out and take showers.
* if i change out laundry and **i graze the doorframe** when i enter the bedroom with clothes, i have to discard all of them.
* if an article of clothing touches the edge of the bed, discard it.
* if i even *touch* the dishwasher i have to wash my      hands.
* if she takes a shower and gets in the bed, she will not      leave the bedroom or she considers herself dirty and would have to shower      again. this means if she is hungry or thirsty i will bring it to her.
* her showers last around 40 minutes. she bathes 3-4      times and washes her hair 2 times. our water bill is ridiculous.
* if my son (2 yo) takes one step outside of his playpen      then he has to have a bath before he can go in his bed. this includes      naps. if i take him outside (even just for *1 minutes*), he would      need a bath before he can get in his bed. not even changing his clothes      would suffice.
* when i clean the house (which i dont mind, btw.      cleaning your house is necessary), everything has to be done in a **very      specific order**. no deviations from this order or it has to be re done.

&#x200b;

1. change out laundry and leave washer free
2. wash hands, face, and arms and change clothes
3. sanitize all toys on floor and put away
4. pick up all clothes and put in baskets
5. sanitize all counters
6. clean kids bathroom
7. take out master bathroom trash, wash hands, replace bag
8. take out kids trash, wash hands, replace bag
9. take out kitchen trash, wash hands, replace bag
10. clean guest bathroom, wash hands, take out trash, wash      hands, replace bag
11. take shower
12. put bathroom rugs in washer
13. take shower
14. sweep entire house in a very specific order
15. mop house in very specific order
16. take shower

i want to make this clear - i have no problem with cleaning but i often do something in the wrong order or forget to wash my hands and i get berated. my wife has little patience for mistakes that involve germs. often, i have to clean the house late at night after the kids go to bed so i will be doing it after midnight. of course i will make mistakes when i am mentally exhausted.

&#x200b;

* if i bring her water, i have to wash my hands and then *hold      the cup over my head* as it clears the kitchen counter. she thinks that      if i hold her cup around my chest that it will touch the counter and be      dirty. i do the same thing with plates and utensils.
* if i have to discard a piece of clothing on the floor      in her vicinity, she will change her clothes and get pissed. she thinks      that the **air created when the clothing hits the floor will blow      bacteria all over her**. this is perhaps the one that triggers me the      most.
* if my dog gets out, he has to have a bath before he can      come back. he gets out often because she wont close the door.
* my wife **will not touch doorknobs**. she uses her      foot to close the door and she will just fucking leave it open over      actually closing it - even when she leaves the house.
* if i leave the house with my phone, i cannot bring it      back into the house until i sanitize it. that includes washing the phone      case with soap and water and then using alcohol on the phone.
* no shoes on the in house, ever. i had contractors over      a month ago and they wore shoes. i had to sanitize every object they      touched, and mop twice where they walked.
* her depth perception is abysmal. we get in so many      fights because she thinks that i touched her with a dirty object when i      was *halfway across the room.* when she gets dressed, i half to watch      her and verify that she doesnt touch her body with the outside of the      shirt. same with pants.
* we never have people over because of her fear of      infection. plus, i am the one who has to clean and sanitize so i am      reluctant to even mention hosting an event or having a party at the house.

there is more things i have to deal with but i cannot remember every situation right now. the worst of it for me is the constant laundry (3-4 loads a day - sometimes more) and showers (4-5 showers a day). i have taken as many as **9** showers in one day and as many as **35** showers in one week. i wash my hands over 50 times a day. i have gotten to the point where i just pretend to take a shower or wash my hands if she isnt in the room. i fantasize about just being able to get through my day not feeling like a puppet on a string. i get no sleep (maybe 4-5 hours on average) and have almost no free time. and this is not because of my kids.

you may be thinking, ""dude, go to marriage counseling."" we did that about two months ago. my dad may be the only person who really knows what i am going through he told me to be completely honest - hold nothing back. that is exactly what i did. i told the counselor everything that i just revealed to all of you. i have had this talk with my wife already but she says, ""you can leave at anytime, if you cant handle it you dont have to be here."" the counselor was speechless for a second but then began to address my wife and asking her if it was all true. my wife just shutdown and barely refused to acknowledge it. after the session, my wife got upset at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" and canceled all future sessions.

i want to say one last thing. before she went deep into this fear of infection, we had a great relationship. we loved each other and felt we were meant to be. i still love her and want it to work. i have been dealing with the worst of this for nearly 3 years now. i am physically and mentally exhausted. i have thought of leaving multiple times but i am afraid of how it will affect my kids. we also bought a huge house and invested sums of money into it that we would lose. my wife refuses to take medication for her anxiety (i dont blame her, most of it hasnt worked in the past).

has anyone ever been in situation similar to this? thank you for taking the time to read and i appreciate any and all advice.

**tl;dr** \- my wife suffers from extreme germophobia and it severely complicates my life and my childrens' lives.

&#x200b;

edit:  i want to make something clear.  my children take 1 bath a day (sometimes two).  they dont do what i do - that is the one thing i absolutely fucking put my foot down on.  but yeah, they need out of this situation asap.  i talked to my wife a few minutes ago and let her know exactly how i feel - again.  she broke down, as expected, and ended our conversation.  when i get home we will continue to address this.

"i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.. update here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d68r0f/update_im_out_600_after_my29m_best_friend31m_and/)

&#x200b;

groom and i had been friends since middle school and best friends since high school. i'm one of the only people he talks to about his emotions, which is particularly important because i've been his go-to for advice, especially in relationships. in fact, since knowing him, i've talked him through each of his break ups. we've mutually called each other brothers, he helped me move, i helped him plan and throw his mom's birthday party. i'm close with his family, his mom actively asks about me. i've also been close to each of his significant others, save for his now wife.

a month after his engagement, groomsman invitational boxes went out. we have a very tight knit group of friends that have been together since high school, supplemented by college and work friends. of the original high school group, i was the only one not asked to be a groomsman. this obviously stung, but i maintained a jovial demeanor towards everyone while acid flowed in my veins. it triggered my depression for a solid month where i questioned so much (do any of my friends even care about me? am i not groomsman material? is it because they thought i was too fat?) until the groom and i had a talk.

he said it was a very hard decision choosing groomsmen, which i'm sure it was. he told me that i was in the original roster of groomsmen (only 6 out of 7 had received invitations) but that the bride would not sign off on my involvement. apparently, i had said something off-color about their relationship as it was beginning and she held it against me ever since. she'd apparently never brought it up until now, years later, and never gave me any indication of being uncomfortable with me (her family even loves me). i'm generally a very positive, well-received person, so this was news to me. he said it was tearing him up inside, and i believed him at the time, and he asked me to try and talk to her, see if we could make amends. he said that he'd let her know that i knew about how she felt towards me and that i'd be reaching out to talk about it. so i messaged the bride through text and dm, saying (paraphrased), ""hey! i'm so sorry if anything i've said has upset you. can we meet sometime and talk? i'd love to clear it up, or hear your side at least."" the bride leaves me on read, and a month later, the final groomsmen invitation box goes out to another friend.

fast forward to a few weeks ago, the bride, groom, and i are hanging out. groom and i are talking, and i'd since been able to process the reality of not being involved in my best friends wedding, so i ask how he's doing, and how all the prep is going. the conversation leads us here...

groom: hey man, i wanted to know if you could help me out with something?

me: sure. what's up?

groom: i was wondering if you would want to usher for me? it's no big deal if you can't, but i want you to be there for me if you can, you know? like, be a part of the wedding.""

me (very touched): yeah! of course i can, dude. anything for you two.

groom: thank you so much. you know, we also have the rehearsal dinner next week. i know it's late notice, but if you can make it...

me: i'll have to see if i can leave work early, but i'm already there, man. thanks for thinking of me!

a week goes by with no updates or details on ushering or the rehearsal dinner, so i shoot him a text saying, ""hey man! big day's this weekend. just wanted to reach out and see if you still needed help with ushering, or if you'd still like me at the dinner. i got the time off with my boss, so i can definitely make it. just let me know."" he returns my text a few hours later with a call saying (paraphrased), ""yeah man, we would still like you to usher. i'll text you details later today, but we actually don't need any help at the rehearsal dinner, we kind of want it to just be the bridal party and stuff, but yeah. thanks for helping us out!"" i'm a little put out, but i persevere. at least he asked me to be an usher. that's something, right?

morning of the wedding comes around and i'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time i should show up to the reception to start helping. then bride messages me asking for a favor. these messages were juxtaposed perfectly against the unanswered messages i had previously sent the bride to olive-branch our relationship. bride says they forgot about the appetizers & need someone to pick them up. can i do this for a bride, on her wedding day? sure. oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. **sure.**

at this point i should have stopped and asked myself, ""why am i helping so much? why didn't i ask for their money up front? should being a good friend really cost you so much emotionally, physically, or monetarily?"" hindsight. 20/20. with the ceremony ended, my group of friends who weren't in the wedding party spend the hour and a half before the reception pre-gaming while i go pick up the appetizers. thank god i played as much tetris as i have, because fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. i text the bride to let her know we've got everything together and i'd see them at the reception. once again, left on read.

i get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in. i find no leadership at the venue, no planners, no family who weren't already seated at their tables and otherwise willing to help the newlyweds get things ready. the venue does have staff, but they are all preoccupied with in-venue needs. so i have to carry all the appetizers inside by myself.

since guests were already seating themselves, i immediately moved from placing the last appetizer box in the back to working usher duties at the front. it was a fucking mess. at one point, i was so down about the situation that i literally googled, ""is it an insult if someone asks you to usher their wedding?"" to start, the place cards were in no discernible order. they were also written in intricate cursive that was sometimes unclear. i should mention, too, that because of the cultural heritages of our newlyweds, we had some very interesting, hard to spell, and sure as shit hard-to-read-in-cursive names. we weren't given a table map, or a master list, or any direction at all. the best part is, i say ""we"" because at this point i met my ushering-peers; they were the grooms youngest adult cousins, aged 18 and 19 (i'm 29), and they were really good at finding names and seating people. when i asked why they were so good, they said, ""they always make us do this because no one else wants to. we did this at the wedding last year.""

after finding out that, to the groom, i was about as equal as the lowest-rung of his family, my group of not-in-the-wedding-party friends shows up. they ask me to stay for a drink, but i can't because i'm still ushering. as i step back behind the name card table, i take a look out the door to my left and see the groomsmen laughing and taking a selfie. to my right, i see all of my other friends at a table without me, taking a shot. i look down at the random, nonsensically ordered name cards and i wonder, how did i get here?

wedding kicks off & in the rare instance i can speak to bride & groom they don't say thank you or bring up the money. i also don't talk money because it's their fucking wedding reception, but what should i do, pluck $500 from her wedding dress during the money dance?  i'm sure it's true of other weddings, but it seems like the bride and groom don't really engage or reply when i walk up to them with my hugs and congratulations. i can understand this. maybe they're burned out. maybe they're trying to hold back things from boiling to the surface.

now the last song is playing, and the lights are on, and everyone's getting ready to go home and the groom approaches me.

groom: hey, thanks again for your help. i was wondering if i could borrow you again?

me: what's up?

groom: did you drive here? we have stuff we need to get back to the hotel... it could really help us out.

me: ... how far is the hotel?

groom: 10 minutes away.

me (for a groom, my best friend, on his wedding day: .... sure.

get to hotel, unpack everything, it's 12:30am, i'm hungry. groom says to stick around, we'll hang out, drink more. he goes to get changed, i say i'm gonna grab food & come back. groom asks for food for he & bride. i say sure. bride's cousin overhears & asks me to buy her food too. sure. then she asks the room at large who'd like food. now i'm buying food for almost the whole after party. cousin says she'll venmo me when i get back, & she'll pay for everyone elses stuff. **sure.**

come back, cousin is passed out. drunken guests grab whatever food they see. groom walks up to me, burger in hand, & says he's actually really tired so he's gonna go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. i grab my food, take the elevator to the first floor hotel cafeteria, & eat alone, upset, in silence. at this point, i'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late night food run, and am pretty sure that i never really had a best friend to begin with. i feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous. i went from, ""being a groomsmen,"" to being a guest, to being an usher, to being an unpaid wedding coordinator. this was the first wedding in my close knit friends circle and it turned out nothing like how i thought it would. i've never worked so hard for such little gratitude and i'm left wondering how i could have been such a chump, and how many other times i'd been taken advantage of for being helpful.

the advice i'm hoping for is, how can i go about expressing how terrible a time i had at his wedding without insulting him, if i should do that at all, how can i develop myself to not be put in situations like this, and when would it be appropriate to ask for the appetizer money back? also, i feel like the missing puzzle piece is the bride's side of the story, but she still hasn't given me any indication of what i did to her. i know she read my texts about wanting to clear the air, she had to have when she asked me to get the appetizers. how can i start a dialogue with her and sort this out if she won't even acknowledge it? should i just step away from this relationship all together (after getting back my money)?

&#x200b;

tl;dr ""best friend"" couldn't make me groomsmen cause of now-wife, who had no problem asking huge favors of me on the day of the wedding, little to no thanks, out $$$, ended up doing the most out of whole friend group (groomsmen / bridesmaids included), ended the night feeling defeated and losing even more money.

&#x200b;

update: wow. thank you for your overwhelming response to this. i want to thank everyone who took the time to share with me, be it positive or negative. i really feel like i need to hear it all before i make a next move, and i'm especially grateful for those of you who have extended friendship to me and those of you have been very critical of me. i'll take it all. i just want to become better than i am now. i'm legitimately reading through everything and, after work, i'll post a fleshed out update.",8
"should i (48m) tell my wife (44f) that i received a sex tape of her in the mail?. throwaway.

this is an odd thing. wife and i have been married 20 years. i've never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

first of the year, i receive a package in the mail. it's a dvd addressed to me, and a typed note that says ""your eyes only"". it's my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. she was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

first i've no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the dvd - none of which i know. i'm assuming it's one of my wife's ex. second i've know idea why they sent it. are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? the tape isn't time stamped so i don't have a frame of reference. she kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

and also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? i know my wife had other partners. hell i had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago i think we're past that. but apparently this person or persons isn't.

the whole thing is strange. i'm not sure what's going on. i haven't told my wife, i'm not sure how she would take it. she's very sexual and adventurous but i don't think she'd like the idea of her past catching up to her. but i don't think i'll get to the bottom of this unless i tell her.

edit - update. i'm overwhelmed by the responses. thank you for your interest.

i did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. some mentioned letting her watch it in private and i gave her that option. she did and we talked at length. some of it is a bit clearer now.

the two ""amateur"" looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. that's why the camera doesn't move and that's why the room is the same.  i asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

the other is a boyfriend she dated when her and i met, before we actually started dating. she knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it's him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

why?

she admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on facebook. when she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. she thinks he sent the dvd to cause an issue with us.

for the first time i now have doubts. her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. and honestly i may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - i know it was 20 years ago but that's still hard to take call me shallow if you want. also she didn't seem shaken by the dvd or the fact i had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. i had the idea she'd rather i didn't have it but now that i did, oh well. 

it still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the dvd was made in 2013 but i'm just getting it now? that many be minor but it may be everything. plus how does this gentleman know where i live - facebook doesn't give you that information. being in contact with someone does so now you see why i have doubts.

thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. i love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it's slapping us in the face right now. i will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

edit ii - i want to clarify something. i've been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that i'm upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. none of my business, it was 20 years ago i should man up, that sort of thing.

look, i said it was hard to take. most men understand their partner was with different people before them. but seeing their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. i didn't say i was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. it's just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. i'll get past it , but it's not an easy thing. and for everyone who says ""it was 20 years ago lighten up"" i challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. frustrated at best. you won't love her less but you'll not feel great afterwards trust me. so thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position i'll ignore you thank you very much .

final edit - this will be my final edit. thank you all for your support but all i will say is, it's time for me to make some decisions. i hacked into my wife's facebook account - childish and immature i'll admit but i did it nonetheless. and i found things disturbing enough that i need to think long and hard about what i do next. i've given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and i'm questioning her more than ever before. heartbroken is putting it mildly. it's time for me to work on my life and my self. thanks to everyone and their interest .",8
"update i (28m) think my girlfriend (26f) of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love.. link to previous post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aejrnr/i_28m_think_my_girlfriend_26f_of_four_years_is/?st=jqrwkq4d&sh=e1753ed8)

i finally talked to my girlfriend about it and unfortunately, she is now my ex-girlfriend. a lot of things that i never expected to happen did happen in a span of hours. 

as soon as she opened the door to our apartment, i could tell that she was already starting to cry. seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because i didn't want to put her in that position. 

i had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. 

we sat down, there were lots of tears. i thought i would be bitter, angry and that i would be screaming at her the whole time but i felt disappointed instead. 

i told her that i saw the messages and explained how i ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. 

she kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn't know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.

then i told her that we go more way back than they ever did. i was there through her lowest point, i helped her get up.

she admitted that they had sex more than three times. 

i saw it coming, i had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. at that point, i was full on crying. i can't remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. it still is now. 

i remember telling her that i was done, that whatever we had was over. she kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, i don't think i ever will. i can't tolerate people who cheat.

by that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. 

obviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. 

when i posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. his place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. he'll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that i can't bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.

we both agreed that i don't mention him in this post. i'm glad that i really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. 

it's almost 3am, i'm heartbroken as ever but i'm trying my best. i'm sending my resignation letter to work this morning. every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. i'll be flying home as soon as possible. 

to all my aussie mates,  if you live near/around chapel hill, let me know! 

america, you were great but now it's time to come home. thanks for the help everyone.

edit: i'm crying again, not because i got cheated on but because i realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. i almost can't believe i looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. i am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.

anthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. 

i may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but i gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. 

other than that, i am feeling better. it still feels surreal that she's gone but what can a bloke do? she made her choice so i made mine. 

i woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that i shouldn't rush things and that she's stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. 

it sucks that i may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. i thanked them and said that although i believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. 

ex also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so i junked it straight away. 

i miss her like crazy. i know it will take a lot of time to heal me but i guess i can wait. 

ps. i'll message my newfound aussie friends when i go through all the comments. exact date of my flight hasn't been sorted out yet, but i'm hoping i'll be home by next month.

"my (19f) boyfriend (20m) broke up with me because i'm too good at sex. we've been dating for a year and he's a year older than me and we met in college. we took things slow bc we're both virgins and it's special to both of us so we agreed we'd wait until we're really in love and sure about each other. and after a year, we could see ourselves married in the future so we decided to have sex. 

even after our first time, he asked me if i really was a virgin or if i lied because i was too good. no i didn't lie. i just watched some educational videos and practiced on my own. since then, he'd get weird during sex. like if i did something good, he'd say it felt good and then his face would change like he was thinking. now i know he was questioning if i really was a virgin. 

anyway. he broke up with me yesterday after we had sex. tmi i was riding him and he said i act like a porn star and he's obviously not the only guy i've been with and he thinks i lied to him. i told him i watched a ton of porn and copy from the videos but he doesn't believe me. 

great. never thought i'd be dumped for being too good at sex. it just really sucks bc we had sex bc we thought we'd be long term and we broke up already. i want him back. i know he's just being paranoid. how do i tell him that i wasn't lying?

okay quick update: he texted me and said sorry so we're back together :)",8
"overheard my 26m fiance 24f tell her friend on the phone that she ""settled for being with me,"" and that marrying me was her ""last resort."". 

update 2: just did one of the hardest things i've ever had to do. today after breakfast i told her we should ""sit down and talk."" she was hesitant, but i said it was important. we went to the living room and she said to me ""i already know what this is about."" my post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under ""popular."" of course the water works started happening right away. i told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. through her tears, she said ""i was just joking, i wasn't serious."" she then went on saying stuff like ""i love you, i love you."" i told her i can't be in a marriage where my s/o doesn't love me the same way i love them. she tried to tell me that she loved me and that i meant something to her. but it was all bullshit. she said she ""didn't want to lose me."" i told her i don't think this marriage was the right decision. and from there i basically told her it was over. i told her i knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. for all those wondering, we have no kids, and i pay fully for the apartment we live in, and i own almost everything we have other then her clothes. i even pay for her car. so after all of this she'll have little to nothing left. before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, i've never been so happy with a decision i've made in my life. after that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me ""fuck you."" she started screaming at me, telling me ""you just can't end things like that."" i told her i could do whatever i wanted, and that's when she became very hostile. she screamed at me saying, ""you're the fucking worst relationship i've ever been in. you think i can't find someone again?"" ""do you think you'll ever from someone as good as me? you're a fucking idiot my name."" she grabbed her bag and phone, and said ""i'm leaving!"" before slamming the door behind her. at that moment i felt like i was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you'd find of tv. i sat down on the couch and cried, and i'm still crying as i type this up. it's both happy and sad tears, and i knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. she never loved me, it was obvious. our relationship only went one way, and i feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier i live in california, and i'm gonna start the process to annul our marriage. tomorrow, i'm gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that's essentially where they belong. (i'm not throwing out her stuff. just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. all of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and i know my life will certainly improve as a result.

edit/update: thanks everyone for the kind words! really has made me feel a lot better! going to be talking to her soon. also, i noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, i understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn't. i've been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. not really used to calling her my ""wife"" yet. also i used an old alt since she uses reddit. anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the internet can care so much about a person they don't even know. i'm going to talk to her today. i will be updating you all soon after.

edit: meant to put wife in the title but now i can't change it.

basically the title. i overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while i was passing the bedroom. this friend is in a serious relationship. my wife then said to her, ""sweetie, remember it's your choice. don't settle for just anyone. that's the mistake i made. who knows who else i could of had. my name was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up."" hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. does she even love me? why am i being treated as a second base? 

am i being dramatic and overreacting? i haven't said anything about it since. i honestly don't know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.",8
"update to: i found out i have a daughter who thinks i was her mother's rapist. it wasn't rape. what next?. ten days ago i requested advice and the post got removed after a day because i didn't use a throwra.  i'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. i alerted the moderators i would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

original

i received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a dna match and she is my biological daughter. it was a long and emotionally charged letter. she said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish i had caused her and her mother and grandparents. the letter was gut wrenching.

i was shocked but also skeptical. i have been married 25 years and i have three great kids. i have never raped or abused a woman ever! i thought this had to be a prank or scam. i had done home dna ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child i wasn't aware of. but when i logged into my account, there she was.

i did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, terry (fake name), i had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  we broke it off mutually and remained friendly. the very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. it was a casual hookup and i remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. also unprotected. afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. we both went home the next morning for summer break. terry didn't come back to college the next year, which i gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

one of the reasons terry and i were incompatible was religion. she was catholic and i'm jewish. i was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. my supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a jewish ex-boyfriend. but who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

it kills me that i have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. i can't imagine growing up thinking i was a product of rape. that has to be so hard psychologically. i am in pain for a child i didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

i have been debating what to do. i have not written back to my daughter. i badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). my wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. my best friend says i should hire a lawyer. i don't know what to do and it's eating me up. advice, please!

update

i hired a lawyer. he recommended that i respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. i wrote her a short message and described how and when terry and i met. i was careful not to attack terry and to offer sympathy. i explained that our sex was consensual. a week went by with no response.

two days ago my daughter wrote me and said terry now claims she was raped a month after she and i had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. she's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. i find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not i guess it gives terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

yesterday i spoke to my daughter for the first time. she was crying and so was i, so it wasn't easy to say much. before we hung up, i told her that i loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and i hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. she sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

my wife and i told our kids about a week ago. they are teenagers and took it really well. all three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. my wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. she has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. my daughter is going to call me again tonight and i'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. we have a lifetime of catching up to do.

meantime as for terry, i feel like my daughter and i were robbed, but i really don't want to dwell on it. she hasn't reached out to me and i don't plan to either, though i'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.


edit:  i'm overwhelmed by all the love coming at me from reddit. thank you all for your support, compliments and helpful opinions. really, really.
i promise i will post an update!

"update: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.. original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

i'll post the update first, since there has been some change since i last posted. then i'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of pms i received.

yesterday, i received a call from my gf. she was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. i told her that i still care for her, and that i'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

she told me that a few days after i told her we were done, she called up her mother to talk about this. apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that i was actually manipulating her to do so. her mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

after i left her, my gf called her mum up to talk about what went on. my gf said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. my gf said she broke down on the phone, and her mother kept asking her what she will do. the conversation then ended when my gf said she didn't know.

then she started texting. after a few hours of thinking, my gf sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. she was then blocked.

my gf then called me, and told me everything.

she will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

i discussed this with my gf, and we both completely agreed that i had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that i put my foot down, because had i not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (her words, not mine)

she further went on to say that i am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a mum, if she had me, she could get through this. i broke down at this point.

i love her so much. in truth, i probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though i knew i'd resent it. i made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if i had made the right decision.

i'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

also, screw any mother who places religion over their own child. friggin lunatics.


now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: no. my gf did not cheat on me. i am almost certain about this. not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. moreover, her roommate took photos of my gf after she came home assaulted. it's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: i don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my gfs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: my gf was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the mum).

4: thanks for all the people telling me i did the right thing. it was really difficult. i'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: to the people who pm'd me telling me i'm a monstrous baby killer - i fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

thanks reddit.",8
"my(39m) wife(40f) slapped our daughter (16f) after she came out as gay. i need help dealing with my wife and my daughter.. i'm actually an immigrant from mexico, so my english is average at best. 

i must admit that i was really homophobic and racist growing up. that was how i was raised. but when i moved to america, i met my wife and she helped me a lot. she helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. i owe that to my wife.

yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. so we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. it took some time to sink in, but i understood. when i asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. she asked me if i was fine with it and i told her that i had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. i must admit that i felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

after that, i asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. she told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. i'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. so i started to get ready to prepare it. 

at this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. and when i came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. my daughter was crying and i was really shocked. i asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. she told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

i asked my wife to leave, because i was really angry. after my wife left i told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and i'll stand by her. my daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

now, my wife refuses to talk to me. she told me that she will be back only if i agree to help my daughter become straight. idk what to make out of this. i'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. i love both of them very much and i'd like to help diffuse this situation. can i get some advice here?",8
"update: my (21m) girlfriend (21f) went on an anti semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. i'm jewish.... op: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc0gp4/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti_semitic/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app


i figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. this all happened a few days ago. 

the day i made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. well, that didn't turn out well. 

before i told her about my background, i asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards jews. she pretty much sounded like hans landa the whole time. at one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for ""teaming up"" with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible ""prank"" on a jewish student. 

afterwards i bluntly told her that i'm jewish. she didn't believe me at all and thought i was joking. i told her that i was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. this went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

when it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. things went 0-100 very fast. she got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. she said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. when she insulted me i reminded her that she really liked me despite my ""dirtiness"" which just pushed her over the edge. she cried hysterically and i left. 

the next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that she dumped me and not the other way around.  she warned me not tell people that i dumped her since that would make her look bad. i didn't say anything and closed the door. i heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare i close the door in her face and that ""you people are all the same"". after a while she left and started writing me on snapchat. i blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. i've never seen her act so crazy. 

long story short, i blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. i knew things wouldn't go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but i didn't know it would be this bad. some of her stuff is still at my place. oh well 


**tl;dr told her, broke up with her.**",8
"my (18f) best friend (18f) cheated on her boyfriend (21m), got pregnant and is lying that he's the dad. should i tell him?. ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. also i know this is pretty fucked up but natalie is a nice girl, she's my best friend. 

we graduated high school this summer so our friends and i all went on a small vacation to italy. we found a groupon thing online so it wasn't too expensive. natalie is dating eric but he didn't come on the trip with us. it was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. it's pretty well known among us friends that dylan who is in our high school, likes natalie. he's like really into her. well when we all went to europe, since eric wasn't there, natalie was all over dylan. acting like a couple, being all flirty. they'd sleep in the same bed but she'd insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. well, i shared a room with natalie and i walked in on them having sex. afterwards i asked her what she was doing since she was dating eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. it was not. we were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. dylan's dreams came true that week. but only i knew about it since it was our room. everyone else had their suspicions but i was the only one who really knew the truth. 

when we got back home, she promised me that she was just ""crazy"" since she was on vacation and she'd never cheat on eric again. she kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. so i promised to keep her little fling a secret. fucked up i know but i have more loyalty to natalie than eric. 

she continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she's now pregnant and i asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if i slapped her across the face. she said it's obviously eric and i reminded her about dylan and she insisted that eric is the father and to never mention dylan in front of her again. she's terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told eric and he told her not to worry and he'll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they'll be ok. she told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he's gonna be a good dad. he wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she's busy planning a quick wedding too. 

y'all. dylan is obviously the father. like 100%. they were fucking like rabbits in italy and i don't think she knew how to say ""where can i buy condoms"" in italian. i feel bad for eric since he's like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

i love natalie she's my best friend but this is so fucked up like i feel really bad for eric. i know she's scared and eric would obviously be the better dad but c'mon that's not his baby. dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. eric is older and he's graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. but it's not fair for him. i know she's trying to save her own ass but it's her fault for cheating on him.

i don't know like if i tell eric, natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby's life.",8
"my 33m fiancee 27f chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. how can i ever repay her?. two nights ago, my fiancee accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. the fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. i wasn't home, so i wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. if i was, i would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. it's just stuff. 

she chose differently. first, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. then she went back in. at this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. she knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

both of us have lost parents. i lost my dad 3 years ago. he was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before i actually met her. i have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom i have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. she lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

i don't even know how to begin to say thank you. i'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and i can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. i don't know how to repay her. or where to begin. can anybody think of a nice gesture i can make it up to her? she must be devastated. i can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad. 

tl;dr: my fiancee had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. how do i repay her?",8

short update because i'm supposed to be working. and i don't expect this to get attention because my original post didn't but i don't know who else to tell. 

the day after i posted originally, i told her i'm in love with her, and asked her on a ""real date"". it went well. really well, so easily and just good. and she slept next to me again that night.. i got to kiss her in public! she said it felt like our little family was right, and it really does, it feels like everything just sort of snapped into focus.

i am going to take everyone's advice and not just spring a marriage proposal on her out of nowhere, but i want to marry this girl and have more babies with her. because everything just makes sense now. 

and yes, she said she loves me too!!!!!!

"caught my girlfriend cheating and i cannot cope please help. so long story short i found texts on my(18m) gf(19) phone tonight texting her friend things like ""he pounded my shit"" ""i got some of the best dick last night"" and ""omg it was so good, i couldn't walk last night""

i'm disgusted.  it was her ex, whom i've always felt inferior too like she just hadn't gotten over him even after over a year.

i'm distraught.  i don't even have anyone else in my life rn.  my two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into uni and i have only really ""clicked"" with one guy friend.  my family and i don't even get along nor communicate much.  i lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

she's really sorry.  i saw her crying when she didn't know i could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  i feel bad but like the lying and deception isn't new.  i had to do it.  i told her we're over, but she's welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

but fuck this sucks.  i have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and i just don't know how to cope with this.  i can't eat.  i can't sleep and i have class in the morning.  i keep picturing the texts and visualizing him ""pounding"" her and i'm just disgusted.  i'm just obsessing over it and it's 4 am in the fucking morning.

part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  i know in a while i'll be ok but i just don't know how to get from part a to part b.

please help




edit:  wow.  i don't even know what to say.  guys thank you so much for the overwhelming support.  i get a new notification telling me to be strong literally every three seconds.

i finally fell asleep at 7 am and there were like 40 comments on this.  i woke up and there are over 800 beautiful people telling me to be strong.  thank you so much.  reddit is such a beautiful place.  in the strangest way, i feel really capable of surmounting this today as opposed to yesterday.  you guys definitely played a part in that.

this is the kind of stuff that makes me remember not everyone sucks lmao.  keep up being great in life guys :)

thank you from the bottom of my heart!


edit2:  jesus guys!  you're all a blessing!  i just finished class and i've been getting notifications every three seconds!  going to do my best to get back to everyone.

i am doing much, much better.  i'm feeling freed rather than sorry for myself now.  thank you all.

by far the most frequent advice was to hit the gym.  i'm going to dinner rn but i'm hitting the iron directly after!

on top of this awesome wave of support from all of you, i've had a few good things happen today that are just making this so much better:

-  my job app for a 20$ an hour job teaching sat prep was praised for ""outstanding qualifications""

-  i got invited to participate in drug research here at my school

- and my fucking package arrived that i've been waiting on for a week!

-also one of my friends who cut me off reached out to me

i'm doing well, thank you all, you're all a gift, much love from my corner of the internet, you're all worth a platinum in my eyes!

cheers!

i did it guys :)

"update: i (21m) got my fwb (33f) pregnant and she's keeping it, i want to talk to her about other options.. this is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bhfi57/_/

well some time has passed.. and a lot has happened. my first post had a lot of comments and i got some pm's from people asking me what went down so that's why i'm updating.

so i didn't end up talking about abortion or anything like that because i realized it was pointless and rather insensitive. i didn't talk to her for 3 days, which she got a little upset about and i shouldn't have done that. but i needed some time to figure things out and think, because whatever i was going to decide would change my life so i needed some space, though i could have communicated a bit more (which i'm working on now).

anyways, i realized that i'm just straight up ridiculously in love with her and have been for a while. i was stuck on the age gap, i kinda blocked the word relationship in my mind when i thought of her. some comments really stuck with me and i decided to just trust my feelings. i ended up confessing my love for her when we finally met up and well lots of (happy) tears were shed. she was too scared to talk about her feelings because she knew how i felt about the age gap and she didn't want to make me uncomfortable or possibly mess up what we had. i'm very glad to say that she feels the same way. she completely lit up when i told her, i saw the joy and happiness in her eyes. she was ecstatic, i won't ever forget that. 

every minute we've spent with each other since has been amazing. i really do love this woman, there's just no way around it. we talked so much with each other the past couple of weeks and i don't understand how it has all been so amazing. i know we're probably still sort of in a honeymoon phase right now, but damn if she isn't the one.. i moved in with her almost 2 weeks ago, i had to do some adjusting at first but we worked through it. she has met my parents, that went surprisingly well actually. they got along really well, and they both told me that they could see why we were together and that we are a great fit. on top of that they both told me in private how much they like her, that has never happened with any girl i've introduced them to. the pregnancy came as a big shock however, and they needed some time to process it because well, they're going to be grandparents. i'm an only child so it's a pretty big deal, i'm really close with my parents. they are handling it right now, they asked a lot of questions and we answered them together. they fully support us now which does mean a lot to me.

she's in the last week of the first trimester now, and she's doing really well so far. i've been trying to help her and support her any way i can, and did a ton of reading online to understand what's going on. i offered to pause school for one year, but she insists we can make it work and that i can keep going. we need to work out the details but we got some time left for that.

so yeah... i'm going to a dad. she's gonna give birth to our kid.. still feels surreal to me, but i'm low-key kinda excited. it'll probably be very exhausting and hard at first but that's life. i'm happy that i'm doing this together with her. 

(any tips on how to support her during her pregnancy are welcome btw..)

edit: i don't need any pm's full of criticism, don't bother. just comment somewhere if you want to spit some nonsense",8
"wife (38f) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. it's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks i am going to abandon her and ""our twins"". this is all over the place. i really need help.

my wife and i (m42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

all this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. after some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

we were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. ofcourse i was super happy . 

a week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. the test came back negative and ofcourse i was devastated but she wasn't. she claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. we took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. my wife is in complete denial. now she claims we are having twins. she is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

i am at a loss and don't know what to do. my inaction is making her believe that i want to leave them and that i am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

what the f is even happening. i love her but i don't know what to do.

edit : forgott to add. i have tried talking her into therapy but she accuses me of gaslighting her

**little update/edit:** thank you guys you really helped me out. yesterday was a bad day and you helped me get clarity. i've had a chat with our doctor who will now be handling this with us. i would like to thank most of you with useful advice and hopefully i will be able to update good news someday. but a fuck you to those that said i should divorce her because she is ""crazy"" and an extra fuck you to the guy that used this post to push his anti abortion agenda.",8
"my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby. really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my gf was raped. it was done in a park. she didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. i couldn't force her, so i just stayed with her.

she was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and i've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. we went to therapy, and she knows i'm there for her. she has a history of depression, and i've been really worried.

last week, we found out she was pregnant. i was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. so the baby definitely isn't mine. she is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

so we had a discussion. she is a devout catholic. we initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

i flat out told her that i would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. she cried and begged me not to leave. i told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and i leave, or she aborts the baby and i stay. i would not let this go.

she didn't want either of those things to happen, so i told her we were done...

i feel shit. was i wrong?",8
"i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i don't know what to say to her.. hey everyone. i don't know what to do in this situation because i never expected i'd face something like this. i'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but i'm coming up seriously short here.

i met my wife on tinder at the end of 2015. we talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. by the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. we were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. more than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

i know, heavy topics for a first date. we were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

at the very least i held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. she immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

we dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. after getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

four nights ago was the first time i ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. my wife was out with a friend, and i was doing some house cleaning. i was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so i took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. at the bottom i saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case b were visible. i immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

i had known that my wife was on her period because when i tried to initiate sex, she told me so. i found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and i made comment about the timing being odd. she told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. i figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

i haven't told her that i found the box. when she got home that night everything was so normal. i tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

the more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. what if she was assaulted? what if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? what if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? or, what if she just cheated? i only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of plan b and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

i don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. we have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. i've done nothing to displease her, at least that i know of. maybe i'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than i'm giving it credit for. but i feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because i don't know how.

**tl;dr** i found a torn up plan b box in my trash. the only person who could have possibly thrown it away there is my wife. how do i bring this up?",8
"update 2: i 31m found out my fiance cheated during her 30f bachelorette party, planning on leaving. i am making this as i feel i owe it to all of you. the amount of pm's and responses have been incredible. many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. both the negative and positive comments have helped me and i would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

yesterday i was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. the only person i responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. i didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

during the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as i need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). my plans have changed a bit, i am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend i was supposed to go to. i called him up and let him know i want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but i know i will be leaving for somewhere. he said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. we will see how that turns out...

later in the day i responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since i sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
i picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. i could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. she kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. she i have misunderstood the entire situation... i could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). anyway i told her to explain it to me right then and there. she said because i only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that i should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. during the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
after she told me its all a misunderstanding i told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
after i hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). it didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. she said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. i was just quiet during most of it. the more i didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

she started telling me i can fuck other women if i want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
i told her fucking other woman was not something i needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
the sister was telling her stuff in the background but i couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

she kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. after that she started saying something but i just hung up. 

for like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. he told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that i always will be welcome to him and that i am a good guy. his wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. she tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. i politely tell her i appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

my ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. she then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
she kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and i didnt say much.

after some time i just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. she starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that i said i would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. i told the sister i only said i think about it, and now that i have i realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. she then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
the only thing i said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". after this i just hung up.

my phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. i dont plan on responding. i honestly feel alot better right now, like i can move on. i will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. if someting more happens i will update this post.

maybe i will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

i dont know when i feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, i am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

thanks!

edit 1: thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold i appreciate the support alot. i however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

i would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. i am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

also i dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity i dont mind answering them.

i also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). in a month? when i am back from vacation?

once again thanks for all the support

edit 2: my friend went over to get the ring from her but she refused to give it to him and told me she would not give it to anyone and that i have to pick it up by myself. i dont know why she is still acting like this. i am thinking of just letting the ring go and be able to have a clear mind.",8
"update from the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on christmas. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  my girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

i posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. it got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and i was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and i fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the big talk.

little did i know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. i didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. so thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, i got a dreaded ""we need to talk"" text. yep, all caps. and i was like ""welp, i'm dead.""

she was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). still, she said i had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and i agreed/apologized. she knows i'm writing this update and she's going to read it before i post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

we talked for a long time thursday night. she said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. it's partially a cultural thing, according to her. gf was born and raised in the u.s. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. she said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. she grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

on top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. she said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. she also got very little affection from her parents growing up. it seems like that was all replaced with material things. so, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

all that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. she was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. she was really hurt that i said i thought i was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and i said i was sorry, and i am. i was still raging a little when i wrote that. i asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. it wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

we've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. i'm totally fine this. we've been together for almost 3 years and i think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. she's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. we spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. it's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. i'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. no one can change their habits overnight.

we're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. the plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. she also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. it's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. we're going to give it until my lease is up in march (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. she isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before march.

tl:dr: thanks, reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. i did and i think things are going to get better.

edit

to everyone who's wondering, her parents are from mexico.

gf has a job and her own income. she is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. you're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. in that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. that's now just out there for the whole world to read. you can't say that wouldn't be alarming. she said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. all things considered, i think she was pretty reasonable about it. ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure i thanked reddit for the perspective. no, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. she's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",8
"i 26m upset a woman 20sf and my friends are acting like i'm in the wrong.. hey guys.

i went out clubbing last night with my friends. there were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. my girlfriend hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. i offered to stay in with her but she insisted i go out and have a good time. 

at the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. they were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

one of them, lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. she was pretty but i was not interested as i have a girlfriend. i told her this but she then started asking for pics of hannah. i showed her and she said that i ''could do better than that''. i was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

later me and my friends were dancing, and lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. i gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. a while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. she smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. i was absolutely fuming and in response i poured my beer on her head. she started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. i understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like i was wrong to pour my drink on her. they all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

the ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when i pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

nobody said goodbye to me last night and i made my own way home. i told hannah what happened and she agrees that i didn't do anything wrong. i tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

how do i sort this out in a mature way?

tl;dr: my friends are acting like i was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.",8
"update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met. this is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

as a quick summary: i thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend ""maggie"" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker ""joe"" and his wife ""kate."" after just a couple weeks, she was trusting joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to maggie's family thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. i thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or maggie had attachment issues.

i figured out what was going on and i feel like a huge idiot. i went to see maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if i didn't like what i heard i'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue i couldn't handle.

i had the opportunity when i saw the gifts maggie had gotten for joe and kate's kids. it seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

i asked maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to joe and kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for christmas.

i wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then maggie said that she used to exchange christmas gifts with joe and kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

i realized i was missing something important. if maggie had other christmases with joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like i thought. i had thought that maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but i didn't think maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. i didn't want to ask, so i acted normally until i left.

when i got home, i went through maggie's facebook. she wasn't lying and she's not crazy. i found a ton of photos with joe and kate going back a decade. from what i can figure out, they all went to college together, joe and maggie were big brother and little sister in a coed frat/sorority, and maggie and kate were roommates. i also found pictures of maggie as a bridesmaid in joe and kate wedding and pictures of maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. all of maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that i know all this.

i think this whole thing is my fault. i have adhd and i don't handle it well. i've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where i start zoning them out. i've been called out for this before. i think it's pretty likely that maggie did tell me about joe and kate and i just wasn't listening. maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so i think it's more likely that i wasn't listening when maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

this was a pretty big wakeup call for me. i've been ignoring my problem because i didn't want to face facts that it was serious but i know i need to do something before i make anymore mistakes. i'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.",8
