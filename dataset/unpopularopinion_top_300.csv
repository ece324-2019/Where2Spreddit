"eating cereal with water is better than with milk i am a true believer that cereal with water is better. the taste of milk conflicts with the taste of the cereal, whereas water does not. while still getting the same texture, water does not ruin the taste of cereal. my friends crucified me when i told them this...so for this reason i am coming here in search of others who share my beliefs of water being better than milk. 

edit: i pour the cereal before the water, for those asking

"reddit not covering the sri lanka bombings the same way it covered the new zealand shootings is dirty politics. the 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few muslims. they carried out the terrorist attacks and should be condemned as much as the white mass-shooter.

evil is evil. stop blocking breaking news.






edit: i would like to clarify. 
i am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-christian, or anti/pro islam.

i am simply stating that this act of violence as well as all other tragedies should get equal coverage, i had to go deep into reddit to find any news and its appalling. 200+ people lost their lives, and it didn't get the same attention as notre dame or new zealand massacres. 

i don't think they get the same coverage because of a fear of triggering a particular group, in this case muslims. it could have been extremist christians and i would say the same thing about them. 

humans really are the greatest risk to humanity. stop the violence and protect the planet. why is it so hard for some people to not be shitty?",6
"amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist and thus deserves to be in jail see below edit: thanks for the awards. i hope this post can raise some awareness.

in a speech schumer gave(https://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) at the  ms. foundation for women's gloria awards and gala, she confessed to having sex with a college friend that was so drunk, he couldn't even get an erection let alone consent to having sex. ""and then came the sex, and i use that word very loosely. his penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand"". sex without consent is the very definition of -rape-.

amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. in this link(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8urhxqrq2_4&feature=youtu.be&t=480), amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. the host says ""so you raped a guy"" at 11:12(https://youtu.be/8urhxqrq2_4?t=670) and amy replies ""yeah i know. when i tell this story i say i let a cab driver finger me but really i took his hand...\sic\"". if the genders were reversed and a male comedian had confessed to stuff like this twice, he'd be in jail after public outrage. why the double standards. amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist.",6
"pedophiles who are trying to get help are brave. it takes a lot of balls to admit that you're attracted to children. if they are trying to get help, they shouldn't be attacked by people for being a bad person. a pedophile is not a bad person until they actually commit an offence.",6
"if the father of your child is still active in their life and paying child support, you're not a single mother, you're a single woman. i think people make a big deal about how hard it is to be a single parent when they have joint custody, their ex wants to be in their child's life, and they receive  child support and/or alimony, even though the only thing that's different between them and me is that someone sleeps in my bed at night.

eta: i didn't think this would get so much response. but since everyone is in my inbox making assumptions, let me clarify and say that a really quick internet search would have shown you i'm a 30 year old white married woman with kids ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not a bitter dude who pays child support. calm down.

"being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but i don't have a rally cry of support behind me my ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. i have none of that. its not that my friends don't think i'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. what about single dads?  we do the same shit. i work and take care of my kids the same way but i don't get celebrated like i'm doing something amazing. i just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. i hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because i sounded like i wanted a cookie for being a dad. it may have sounded like i wanted credit for some shit i'm supposed to do. 

that's not the case. i've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and i'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then i play with my kid so i'm not just there on my phone. its not the same for us. we don't have the same resources. although some of you have suggested some that i hadn't heard of. 

anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and i think that may be how it came across. thanks for all your support and for making me feel like i'm doing good as a parent. 


edit 2 - well this blew up. i'd like to say that i really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. to those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why i put this in unpopular opinions. not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

as has been repeatedly pointed out, i know i'm not a full time single parent. i'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. sometimes its hard. just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. i can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props.

"i'm all for being kinky but certain 'kinks' are just a mental illness masquerading as being sexually adventurous like if you like to be called ""daddy"" in bed it's a bit freudian, weird maybe, but i don't mind, you know? if you wanna be tied up, be tied up. have hot wax poured on your titties or snort coke of a dude's dong, i don't mind at all. 

but if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness.

"in a lot of children's shows like peppa pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. the girls save the day. i don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. like there's barbie movies too in which barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. a lot of kids shows are like this. the father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

in peppa pig, specifically, the father of peppa is an engineer. he has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. it's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. meanwhile ""mommy pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. the whole thing is pretty insidious.

from an early age it sends a message of girls being empowered, but how about the little boys? like sure there's still superhero movies but those are aimed at a little older audience, plus all those superheroes are usually genetically mutated in some way and unrealistically handsome, so few kids would identify with them.",6

social media has like minded individuals the opportunity to find each other and create a larger voice. we act like we're living in a world where the average person is this upset by everything snowflake when it reality the average person is as sick of it as everyone else. i mean how many of you have actually met one of these people? because i only hear about people getting upset with things like ""baby it's cold outside"" ",6

you shouldn't be allowed to drive a motorcycle unless you have killed a man for his crystal methamphetamine i am tired of all these pussies thinking they are tough because they ride a motorcycle and die an early death and blame it on car drivers instead of their poor life decisions. a real motorcyclist has killed at least one man for his crystal methamphetamine and will instead die from other poor life decisions.,6
"parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl i've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. my parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

these girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

i'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but i feel they still need to be taught that. 

and same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

edit; if a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. he definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. if that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

this post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. that way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",6

"""ok boomer"" is a completely reasonable and well-deserved response from millennials and younger generations due to the mess that the previous generations left us to deal with and their refusal to take responsibility for their actions. facts:

‚Ä¢	millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did‚Äîdespite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

‚Ä¢	cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

‚Ä¢	there is not one single state in the united states where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

‚Ä¢	student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in america, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

‚Ä¢	cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


for example, the bureau of census reports that the average price of a new home in june 1998 was $175,900.

according to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. the same report places the average sale price for june 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

a gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in june 2014, when adjusted for inflation. the actual national average price, as of july 2018, is $2.88 ‚Äì 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

the median household income in 1998 was $38,885. the most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. the bureau of census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 ‚Äì higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

this did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. ceo salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

millennials truly have it harder than our parents did.

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

and yet, boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. that we're lazy and entitled. 

no, we're not. the data shows that millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

for years now, when boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

we learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. so now we just say, ""ok boomer"".

"if your first language is english, you have no excuse for not being able to distinguish between ""there"", ""their"", and ""they're"". the same goes for ""your"" vs. ""you're"" (and also ""two"", ""too"", and ""to""). these words are so commonplace that getting them wrong is just lazy. 

i feel like telling people (politely) when they've used them incorrectly is the right thing to do, and saying ""language is fluid"" isn't appropriate for such a serious mistake. i think it's fine to ignore minor mistakes with punctuation and spelling, but using the wrong ""there"" actually changes the meaning of a sentence (often to nonsense), since the *wrong word* is being used.

"thanking god for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person. i'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but i've seen enough posts and comments online. i've had enough.

i have nothing against religion. you can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. however, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

i've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""god is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

no. i don't care how real you think he is, god had nothing to do with that. those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not god - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. god did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. god did not come down from the heavens. god did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. god did not do that surgery. *they did*. and saying that god did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. it completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *especially* if that person is not religious.

sure. you can call it a miracle or god's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. god didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. it doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

but to say that god did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. it's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. you're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. it's just wrong.

**small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: i recognize that starting this off with ""i have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. but i don't have anything against religion as a whole; i have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. it's a simple matter of a lack of respect. additionally, i don't mean the common ""thank god!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. what i mean is the active, continuous thanking of god versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking god and not those involved, or simply making god the main focus of the gratitude). also, i gotta be that person as i don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ‚ô™siiilver and gooold‚ô™!!",6
"can marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least? they're over-saturating the market to the extent that they're really going to go the way of the western at some point. talk about franchise fatigue. yeah, *marvel isn't immune*. they're going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

and, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren't honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest marvel releases. 

from a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren't good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. the stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

they're almost identical to the transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

no, i'm not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up rt with fresh scores for every marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it ""4 stars"" or ""fresh"" because ""it's fun, i guess"" or ""it'll work for the audience it's meant for"". these films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it's in the zeitgeist to. 

of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, marvel is the one that earned that success the least. it just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them ""new"" and ""creative"" because they change up the setting a bit. no. no, i'm sorry, that's not the picture of creative dexterity. they're safe, bland, blow em up action films.",6
"i'm a guy and i wish i could be pregnant i think pregnancy is wonderful. i know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. i supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and¬†i helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. i know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. i wish i could do it, though.


my wife and i agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (i really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


she loved being pregnant.¬†every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. i kissed her belly hundreds of times. and i fell in love with her all over again every time i looked at her. her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. the bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


the hardest part about it is that i'll never be able to realize this wish and i never had a choice in the matter. women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. and i don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. i know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant i'd consider it. i would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant i could get pregnant.


every guy i've ever told has either looked at me like i'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. women i've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. she knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. any guys out there agree with me?


edit: some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. i do not disagree. however, i disagree that i have an idealized view of pregnancy. just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. as i stated above, i am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

it's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. we would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

"plastic bottled water in first world countries should be banned someone made me realise today that in the west we legitimately flush our toilets with water cleaner than 90% of the world and yet we totally avoid drinking our tap water.

so many people go out and buy like bulk packages of water bottles. single use water bottles should be banned,  people should all have reusable bottles.

i mean in capital cities of australia our tap water is perfectly safe, everywhere,  even public bathrooms,  so why wouldn't you just drink it?

avoiding tap water is a first world issue,  i mean places like bali have tap water that is riddled with giardia and bulk ecoli and here we are absolutely avoiding ours when its perfectly safe (mostly,  sorry flint and parts of the usa)

"we spend too much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty. i get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and i am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  i agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  there are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  why is that?  is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  is it that no one in hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

disclaimer - i know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  i don't debate that and i have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. not only respect, but gratitude.  the world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices. but still...

"telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory. there's a youtuber named nikki lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. she looks like this(https://i.imgur.com/hqmuqng.jpg).

if you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. there are rarely any other kind of comments as far as i can tell.

now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. by no societal standards in the world that i can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. she has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. she doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. but i think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. i think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. people flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

i see this as extremely strange behavior. it's almost as if nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. people know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. that's why they leave these comments.

this is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while i'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, i don't think this is a good kind of attention. i think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. it leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

it wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. all caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. it's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. it's actually kind of disgusting. i don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

really, i just feel sorry for this girl. i wonder if she understands what's going on.

edit: there are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. in case it's unclear, i'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a basis in science(https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). i understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what i'm talking about. remember that nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

some clarification about my opinion. no i am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. and now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. so stop saying, hey i'm from norway and i don't want to adopt an african child. your country have zero orphanage?
it's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries.

no i'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
i'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
but if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

and someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

you guys are amazing, yes some of the replies on this post are harsh. but a lot of them are positive as well. we can always look on the brighter side. love and respect to your parents who loved you and raised you like their own.

"traveling only appeals to boring people or people who haven't traveled i've traveled everywhere. the uk, germany, france, india, bangladesh, about half of the us (including california, las vegas, new york, minneapolis, tennessee, hawaii, you get the idea) 

not once have i ever felt ""yeah, i'm experiencing something i couldn't back at home""

when you travel you have to leave most of your belongings behind, so if you have a hobby that requires any sort of specialized equipment too bad. 

i've hiked on mountains, i've swam in oceans, ive been on the london eye, i've run through every single tourist attraction there is and not once have i felt ""yeah that was worth giving 1 week of my life away""

and i'm not some anti social weirdo, i go out of my way to interact with other people. nobody is different, at the core of it people still act like people nothing more and nothing less. yeah sure there are differences, but they aren't interesting. a quick google search or a reddit post will tell you the major """"""""""""""""""culture shocks"""""""""""""""""""""" anyway.

 it bugs me the fuck out that just because americans are seen as ""good"" people in todays society, we dont treat native american killing at the same level as holocaust, when it should be. 

seriously, you see media whine about asylum for immagrants, what about killing and kicking off native americans and confining them in ""reserves"" because americans were fucking shitting themselves for more land?

people say there arent many female millonaires/leaders. what about native americans?

"being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are. people should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. my first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven't done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

edit: a couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn't be proud of your family. that doesn't apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. this extends to your community. what i am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

another point i'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. current mongols don't need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan. i don't think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler. that also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

""you go girl!"", ""girl power!"", blah blah blah. a guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat?

let me be clear, **i have no issue with a woman if she is fat. i am just not attracted to it. also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because i'm 5'9""**

yes i'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to bumble, and it's not as bad as something like hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. while this is about tinder's new settings, i think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

in fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange coke (which just taste like regular coke with fruits shoved in them).

the double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/em28yfrmdfi?t=9

here's a youtube video of snl making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

there's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and ei is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is leagues apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. it would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

neither is acceptable. the double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is males who are underdeveloped for that age period. if there were a progressive victim stack, males should be ahead of females on the list because of the developmental delay.

"a bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer a bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. this means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually one teacher and one drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. i think it is.

furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. for those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

"i honestly couldn't care less about pewdiepie, or any aspect of his life. right now, reddit is blowing up about pewdiepie's wedding and subscriber count, and i genuinely couldn't care any less. a few years back when i was like 10 i enjoyed a few of his videos but i never understood why he had so many subscribers and fans. the guy really isn't very funny, once you're older than 12. i understand a lot of people rising up during the t-series debacle, but i don't understand why anyone still cares. i don't think his wedding should be any form of news at all, but very much the opposite. i never really understood why people care so much about pewdiepie's everyday life, and i don't think i ever will.",6
"alcohol is overrated and drinking in general is not that fun. i personaly think drinking kinda sucks it taste like watered down aloe to me i personally dont like the feeling you get after drinking a lot it's pretty shit aswell. i never saw the appeal in drinking but almost every other person goes on about how they're gonna be be drinking all night, sometimes talking about how drunk they'll get and talking about how great it is, am i missing something ?

and before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends i doubt that since i have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. hes probably part of the reason i dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

im trying not to come off as someone saying im holier than thou, this is just something i couldn't understand why its as popular as it is.

(not part of my opinion just a bit of detail and a big old thank you to the awesome community!)
edit: umm tbh not quite sure where to start, but i guess thanks for the rewards its very much appreciated!(although i have no idea what they mean still very much appreciated!!) this post blew up wayyy more then i expected since i think i mentioned in the comments im relatively new to redit and made the account several months ago although barely used it until recently and never got more then 20-30 upvotes or likes on any other social media platform (expected this post to do about the same as any of my other if im being honest) so this was definitely a surprise... as i have been very well informed in a lot of comments this isn't actually that unpopular. i was basing my opinion of the country i live in as its has an extremely big drinking culture or atleast in the communitys i've life's and always just thought of it as the norm. i actually just wanted to say thanks to the people that was really nice and gave really interesting comment, rewards and making probably one of my first interactions with the community a really pleasant one, so to all those people a big thank you!!",6
"most female ""influencers"" are softcore porn models and nothing more. lets face it: every second woman on instagram pretends like their fanbase cares about what they're eatting this morning.

i don't understand how oblivious they are? 90% of their pictures are flirty bikini pictures, some with less than a bikini. each picture tries to show up as much skin as possible without breaking guidlines... but we're supposed to take these people seriously when they winge about their fanbase being filled with creeps???

"the death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child. generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. frankly, i believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

the child leaves almost nothing behind. it's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   on the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. they had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

i don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking i think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

edit: spelling.

edit 2: i never imagined this would get so popular. answering to the comments now seems an impossible task, anyway i'd like to clarify some points some of you must have not grasp:
- i'm not saying the death of a child is worthless. to those who told me i should kill myself because i'm advocating the death of children (?), just know that you can't even fucking read
- of course  it depends on the situation, that's why a put ""generally"".
- it's not a competition but it doesn't mean things can't be discussed 
- english is not my first language, so if you think my grammar is shit i'm sorry but couldn't care less.

"kevin hart should not have stepped down over what he said in 2008 dear americans,

what you're doing is making people who tell jokes like this tell them in private, you're not helping in your cause. being offended is a choice and i'm sure you americans can choose to ignore old tweets. back 2008 you could still go on stage in a stand up comedy club and say the word faggot in a joke and people would laugh.

"men who leave after learning their kids aren't theirs aren't doing anything wrong i was reading a post saying that if a man is with a woman raising a family and she tells him the kids aren't his, that he would be in the wrong to leave because ""the kid is innocent"" and that he is still obligated to be a parent to that kid because the woman trapped him by lying to him.

so as long as a woman is able to keep up a lie for several years, she should be able to trap any man to be a dad to her kids?

"alcohol is an absolutely terrible drug and should not be glorified in society. seriously, what other drug can you die from withdrawal? how often do you hear the latest car crash due to alcohol intoxication? it's a mind altering substance that frequently makes people aggressive, unaware (which people use to get others very drunk just to use as a grounds of rape), uncoordinated, ect.

even if i also enjoy a beer or two once in a while, and i don't shame people for enjoying what they enjoy. you do you.

"the us sounds like a truly horrible place to live scrolling through reddit it's full of ridiculous medical bills, companies like at&t fleecing people for more money while providing rubbish service, out of control student debts and requiring degrees for entry level positions with rubbish pay, no good minimum wage and high taxes.  

it appears as though companies can do what they want to the ""little people"" as long as the right peoples pockets are being lined, nothing seems to have any regulation and no one who can do anything about it seems to care.

"the body acceptance movement should be about height, not weight. you can control your weight, but you cannot control your height. if you have weight problems you should try and help them. i can't tell you how to live your life but you shouldn't accept something that could greatly shorten your life if you can use hard work and determination to solve it. i've learned to accept my height. i can't change it, so why stress about it? i can't change girls' preferences, so i just have to live with it because there's nothing i can do about it. weight, that's a different story


edit: a lot of people are saying ""why not both"", but the answer is in the post. being obese has a direct correlation to disease and living a shorter amount of time, so i feel like it shouldn't be accepted (with the exception of metabolic diseases that cause obesity)

also i would like to add that pretty much anything you can't change like your skin color and face should be a part of it too. i have to thank some people in the comments for opening my eyes on that opportunity. the reason i chose height is because i personally feel like short people get shit on possibly more than anything else. if you think that's bullshit, scroll down and you'll see countless comments of people calling me ""manlet"", ""incel"", and ""midget""",6

"alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn't have the social acceptance it does. alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven't done many drugs. it slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. in high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance i've ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

there is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don't seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

i really don't have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower iq and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren't drinking and to clarify i don't mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a slight buzz regularly.

sometimes the worst part about it is that it's so damn funny. and you just have to give credit where credits due. but lately i've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. sometimes i feel like i should laugh at the cleverness of some. but it happens so often and in so many posts that i find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. not unless there's just a golden moment. i've even begun to roll my eyes the moment i open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. i never roll my eyes. at anything. 

i used to really connect to reddits sense of humor but lately i've been really turned off by it. maybe i just need a break.

"i don't care about school shootings, and neither should you. using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't i? if i contended this in public, i'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. but from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. here's why.

&#x200b;

**1,153.** that's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per the washington post.(https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) this averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - terrorism.** let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on united states soil in 2016. this is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. source(https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - falling.** whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 us lives in 2011. the amount of fucks i give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around mercury. so why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   source(https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - diabetes.** if you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. source(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200b;

and, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **airplane/spacecraft crash** \- 26 deaths
* **drowning in the bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **getting struck by a projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **pedestrian getting nailed by a lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **accidentally strangling yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200b;

now, here's a new york times article(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*new reality for high school students: calculating the risk of getting shot.*"" complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? what it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the washington post:(https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>that means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed¬†by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly¬†1 in 614,000,000**. and since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. the chance of a child¬†being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200b;

in percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. it's a number so remarkably small that every calculator i tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. there is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",6

"trying to force someone into atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into christianity. i am one of those atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. i would honestly rather just let people be. i don't think i am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. i have been seeing several threads on reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. albert einstein was a jew, does being an atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? no.

and it also makes me cringe when atheists try to force religious people into atheism. if we are going to strongly condemn christians trying to force others into christianity, we should condemn atheists trying to force atheism on to other people.

if it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

edit: thanks for bringing einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically jewish, growing up in a jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. that being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. isaac newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) christian. if you don't want to use scientists as an example, james madison, who wrote the bill of rights that is idolized by many, was also christian. the conclusion i am making is that being religious doesn't equal stupidity, and atheism doesn't equal intelligence or success.",6

"there needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before i even begin to give a shit about fat acceptance for women. perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but i'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but i talk to gay men a lot. (i've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

i don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. how emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. my size isn't great either but i've come to accept it, however, i know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

when i see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, i laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. a man can't. a woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. why should i focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

the rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. while it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

edit: as an addendum, i'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

all i can say is fuck most of you. you treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. it was luck of the god damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. while the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. even though i accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) i know i could have it a lot worse and many men do. i still have it in the back of my mind that whoever i'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. i'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because i wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**edit 2: i would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

i didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. i'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

firstly i'd like to address this ludicrous notion that i hate women. i dont know how i can prove to any of you that i dont hate women other than me saying i dont. i may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. my problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

i understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. no one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. my main point was i believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **i never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) i simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. i get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. but from where i'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case i apologize and acknowledge my fault. and before anyone addresses it, i'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. that was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and i used penis size as an example. what i really want is inclusivity. of everyone. 

another topic i'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" while i understand the logic, i dont really see how its productive. sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. many of us crave it, strive for it. make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. when a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. if left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. i understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. but i feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. which is why i'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. but i feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. and i agree with that, but all i'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

i obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but i believe i'm a bit of an idealist. for better or worse, i sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. many thought i was an asshole in my post and i would agree with that. i admit i'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why i dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. many suggested that i should start the movement myself, but i'm simply not the right person for the job. i'm hot headed, i sometimes don't think before i speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. i'm a private person, despite how i am online with anonymity, in real life i am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. i also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. i see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" i knew there would be opposition to this post and i was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. perhaps rightly so, because i'm a bit of a dick. but love me or hate me, i stand by most of what i said. 

i sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. supporting one particular group. (culturally speaking i'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) i care about people despite what many of you may believe. and all i really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

the last major point i'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. i'll admit that sure, i wish i had a bigger dick. i feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part i can tolerate it. i've had partners who didn't care and i genuinely believe them. i know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. so you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

one last thing is i really do appreciate the discussion. there are a lot of points i strongly disagree with that i didn't address here, and there are many ideas i really should think over and reevaluate myself. and i thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",6

"if we should blame anyone for the lack of action on climate change, it should be greenpeace. because they killed the viability of nuclear power, the only power source that is clean and can produce enough power to meet our demands without needing to change much about the industry.

because of their crusade on gmos, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

and because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a unesco heritage site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against ddt.

they personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. they have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole. they are the reason we aren't doing jackshit about climate change, because their anti-science activism has ruined the reputation of every technology that could yield the most results.

edit #1: a slight correction on the ddt point. it was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. it was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. however, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that ddt is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

"if your are ""literally shaking"" from the recent national tragedies, but you have no direct affiliation with the victims, you need to get over yourself. i have seen a few overly dramatic people on twitter and reddit going on about how they are ""literally shaking"" from the recent spree of mass shooting attacks.

while those attacks are worth a long in depth civil discussion by itself, if you aren't directly affiliated with the victims, you need to get a grip with yourself and stop making everything about you.

like you are taking national tragedies, and making it about yourself. if it bothers you that much, get off your ass and speak to your local lawmakers.

it just really annoys the shit out of me. like i may like guns, but at least i respect anyone calling for action against guns. that's action. you're voicing a stance, and that's good. 

you saying ""omg, i'm literally shaking"" is just fucking worthless reaction to tell anyone. 

get a grip.

very classy. you're mad about me saying anything about these attacks, but you realize the recent orlando attack was a gay nightclub, right? is that irony lost on you when calling me a ""faggot""? 

otherwise, thank you for the mostly civil discussion, even if you really disagree with me. only a few people grossly misunderstood me. i also do have empathy for innocent people getting slaughtered minding their own business, but i don't have room for people seeking attention over something that has little to do with them.

"swimming in jeans is one of the best feelings ever. when you swim in denim jeans it's like you're an armored aquatic creature. the way they feel on your legs especially when you get out of the water is amazing. feeling them slowly dry on you under the hot sun is like a wearable sauna. 

depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. i personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. they (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they're soaking wet. 

also, when your jeans are soaked, they're heavier. it's always leg day when your jeans are wet. 

if you haven't tried swimming in baggy jeans i suggest doing so. it will change your life.

"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men it's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. but every woman i have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. and a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

and if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. if men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. but most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. its ludicrous.

tl;dr: women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. this is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. sorry this was so long.

edit: okay obviously i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so i would like to clarify some things. 

1. this thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. i have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. people who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. i am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. but there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. people refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, i think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have a lot to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. it starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",6

\- so, let me start by saying i deleted most of my text as those lines don't really serve purpose. they were indeed too long to even consider reading through. 

\- the other thing is: i have to admit that this post was rushed. and yes, i am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). the funny thing is that while i might think some commenters are oversensitive i have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and i can also get oversensitive. i don't regret what i wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. some of you made the assumption that i must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. that's right. and sometimes i turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw i'm female for those who thought otherwise). the reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. i can understand that what i said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). and at the end i'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. i should have considered more factors. i want to apologize about that honestly. so thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now i'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. i'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. so thank you for offering the experience. i appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. i'll try and digest them properly in the following days. i'm still think that i'm right about some aspects but not anymore do i believe my reasoning is flawless. i wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**content:**

honesty is not kindness. honesty is honesty. period. i don't mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn't put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. you can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. if you can't take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. and yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

you can't just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too ""soft"") - and how you react to that is your responsibility. the partner doesn't have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it's a sensitive topic to you. i wonder why it's so sensitive‚Ä¶

"my faith in humanity isn't restored when i see something like the bullied girl with a disability wins homecoming queen. call me cynical but it really feels like an ego boost for the people who voted for her. disabled people and bullied people aren't your charity case. you see it all over social media and the news, headlines that read, ""there are still good people in this world. she was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen."" or ""star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate"". sure it seems sweet at first but when i think about it all i can see is someone doing something ""nice"" for their own personal gain. when these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? who gets the interviews and good press? why, the people who did the ""good deed"" of course. most of the time it seems like they don't give a damn about the person who they did something ""nice"" for, instead it's about ""look what we did! we are so nice! we are so good hearted!"" it's all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it's almost never about the person it should be about. it's not sweet and heartwarming, it's almost sort of heartbreaking because i've seen instances where people will do ""nice things"" for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. it was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. if you want to do something nice do it when nobody's looking and don't accept any congratulations for your good deed.

eta: like i said in a reply to a commenter, sure its a ""nice thing to do"" and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it's a nice gesture all around, but disabled people aren't mindless angel pets. they have brains and lots of them don't like to feel pitied or patronized. especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. i'm not saying ""don't ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives"" i am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. also if you're gonna do something nice for someone make sure you're being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. don't be nice one day and then cruel the next. i know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that's not my main issue here. the motive isn't the issue either, it's the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. instead of mistreating someone, doing one ""nice"" thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. my issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. i really don't give that much of a shit about ""prom queen"" or shit like that anyway, i'm using it as an example. i'm almost 20 years old and when i was younger i never ran for those positions anyhow. another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. that way he won't feel pitiful and have such low self esteem. make him feel like he's not a helpless invalid.",6

"in general, women are grosser than men. i'm a woman. here's my reasoning.

i worked janitorial jobs for almost 10 years, in various settings. banks, doctor's offices, businesses, gas stations, etc. the women's restroom was always, 100% of the time, nastier. things in the toilet i can't even begin to describe. toilet paper everywhere. poop on the walls and the seats. spit and make up on the mirrors. and blood on everything. all the time.

in ten years of cleaning for a living, the grossest thing i saw in a men's restroom, was poop stains in the toilet. i worked for a million dollar company, where everyone dressed up. and had money, and the women destroyed their bathrooms. sometimes i wasn't even sure the things i saw, came out of humans.

secondly, the grossest cars and bedrooms i've been in, were women's. in female friends homes i've seen rotten cheese under the bed, curdled milk on the nightstand. dirty streaked underwear on the floor, dog shit, used condoms, and more.

i've never seen worse than dirty clothes on a man's bedroom floor.

women are far nastier than men.",6

"there were better female-empowering shows and movies 20 years ago than there are today. this came up while discussing movies with my sister. i asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry. she said something like ""i'm not sure if they got the roles cuz they're good and female or just because of the latter"" and it really opened my eyes. 

the current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like wonder woman being exceptions). i found terminator, power rangers, castle, etc. way cooler when they made them equals with men and not simply trash them. also, wasn't it more inspiring when women made it big back then? i remember when the chess player judith polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. now, with a separate chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. but i'm digressing.

power rangers vs the new ghostbusters is my point. females were part of the original pr team in almost equal numbers. they usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. that. was. awesome. the new ghostbusters isn't. 

now i'm just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

edit: to answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, i'm not making this up. women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. although this was challenged by judit and now by hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn't getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.",6

"american colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path. according to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. in america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


in those 8 years of school, i must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. there are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and i hate using this term) a sheep. to my understanding, american colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (not 100% sure on that) so, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of stem field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90¬∞, not 45¬∞, not even 1¬∞.


edit: ok, i understand and agree that philosophy is important. however, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. i just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. hell, my school has bio ethics, i haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. 
 

it honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.",6

"if your dog has cancer and you opt for chemo, you're a bad person. an old dog lives to be 15. they are also the most loyal and perfect friend could ever possibly hope for. we truly are not good enough for dogs. on the grand scale of intelligence in this world, they are also complete and total idiots. they don't understand medicine. they don't understand that you are trying to extend their life. 

all they know is that on a regular basis the most important person in their life, their owner, is taking them to a strange, smelly, terrifying torture arena. they are stabbed, poked, prodded and their veins are filled with poison. the next thing they know they have gone from terrified to nauseated, fatigued and just feeling like absolute shit. and you, their human, are doing it for what? to squeeze out a tortured 1 - 5 more years?

they don't understand and they can't consent. let your beautiful friend enjoy the last few months in peace and then send them off surrounded by their family. you're not trying to save your dog, you're being cruel because you don't want to let go.

edit time!! everything above this is the same as when i originally posted it. below is my addendum. 

so, it has come to my attention that i was pretty misinformed on how pets react to chemo and the purpose of it. thanks to those of you who were willing to explain without your pitchfork and torch at the ready. for more information on pets and chemo i went to this site, seems reliable(https://wvrc.com/veterinary-specialties/veterinary-oncology-wi/chemotherapy-general-information/). 

in keeping with the spirit of this sub i'd be willing to alter my unpopular opinion to instead state, ""if your dog has ~~cancer and you opt for chemo~~ *a serious health condition and you opt for expensive treatment*, you're a bad person.""

i know how hard it is so say goodbye to your pet. the reason i think you're a bad person is because you're willing to pay exorbitant medical expenses to extend an animal's life because you don't want to say goodbye, especially in instances when the animal is suffering.

in closing, i get it. putting your pet down is a very personal decision, but i still get to think you're a bad person if i think your reasons are shitty.",6

"instagram is ruining everything (a rant) i think that instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. let me explain:

1. **ig is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. while social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. no political or important dialogue is happening. i would argue that even pinterest is more worthwile since at least diys teach you something.
2. **ig is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** why we are all pretty much aware from our own instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **ig is bad for your mental health.** because unrealistic standards are set on instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in ig. this also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (see also this article: http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/(http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). i also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **ig makes people vain.** taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. it's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. this makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **ig gives the worst incentives to people.** the reason i am ranting right now is that i saw a vice video about a poppy field in california that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for instagram (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka)). they then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". so these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. this shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. now i don't think that they are inherently bad people but i think that instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

i would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. so just to clarify, i do think that one can use instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. what i wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. and while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives i feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. i do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. however, i feel that while some good instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",6
"donating organs after death should be the standard, not even mandatory literally normal procedure just like refusing to call an ambulance when someone is in need is a crime, refusing to give organs because your family members want your body to keep them should be a crime as well

"fat women should stop calling themselves curvy or thick i'm so sick of overweight/obese women in the 'body rights'/haes movement referring to themselves as curvy or thick instead of fat. i'm not the thinnest girl in the world, but i'm well inside the 'normal' bmi range (bmi of 21) and yes my thighs do save lives. i work out, i eat healthy, i have learned to control my urges and i take pride in taking care of my body. it irks me that these overweight women just go around calling themselves curvy when it should be used to describe women with a somewhat healthy body and larger boobs and ass.  because of this, i find myself wondering what a guy really means when he tells me i'm curvy or thick. ffs, you're fat! if you're so proud of the glutton you are then you should have no problem in calling yourself fat. rant over. 

edit: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why i care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. fat is fat. not curvy, just fat. there are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on youtube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). i simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations. but hey, if calling me insecure/a bitch makes you feel better, go ahead :) ",6

what some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. even if you're not saying it to their face, even if they're too young to even understand you ‚Äî you're just an asshole. 

also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. they have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. they are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. and just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

if someone gets murdered with a hammer are you going to sue the hammer company because their hammer was used to kill somebody ?  (hammer murders are actually common apparently) 

if someone drinks and drives and kills someone are you going to sue the alcohol company ? or the maker of the car ?  

you can't help what some crazy person does. and everyone else shouldn't be punished for someone else's wrong doing.

"for every guy that ""missed a hint,"" there is another guy who misinterpreted a hint and violated someone's boundaries accidentally. inspired by reading through this askreddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/

many stories in there about hints girls dropped for guys. some of them i read and think, ""i could see someone doing this in a truly platonic way.""

personally, i have an experience i think about often. a coworker (girl) invited me over to get drunk on tequila and sleepover. when it came time to go to bed, i asked where i should sleep and she said ""well you can sleep on the couch or you can come to the bed with me.""

i elected for the bed.

however i wasn't sure what her intentions were, and we had been drinking, so i didn't initiate anything and she didn't either. to this day i still don't know if it was a missed opportunity or a correct interpretation.

my opinion: is it really ""missed hints,"" or is it ""fear of misinterpreting and violating someone?""",6
"the reason a lot of subreddits are moderated terribly is because normal, mentally healthy people don't have the time to moderate internet forums for free. all these ""power mods"" that moderate multiple big communities do so because they don't have a life. removing posts and comments they don't agree with is all they have going for them. i just feel bad that nobody loves them so they have to come here and gain some fake sense of authority by silencing people that don't live in their mother's basement.edit: got a message saying i had to add more to the post, so here it is:

i was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don't like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. i understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as r/nottheonion, r/tifu, r/eli5 and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/soccer, r/pics belong more to the community than the people that created it. 

there aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all. the admins should feel some sense of responsibility when r/news removes important news stories just because it doesn't promote their agenda.

"""you can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea.  let me preface this by saying i do believe in being grateful for what you have. but there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. i hate this for several reasons.

1. the people who say this almost never have it worse. they are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. i have a disability that limits my ability to walk. i don't complain about it much but i've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. i'm aware of that, but i've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. by the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. complaining solves problems. now, i can't speak for everyone with a disability, but i personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. in fact, i'm probably the best person you can complain to. i've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and i grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, i might be able to help. 

4. also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. so even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. look it up.

5. those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if i do it right. after all, isn't that what protesting is? complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. it's used to silence people who need help. i don't think i need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. it's human nature to complain. it just is. 

just something i had to get off my chest, thanks.

"just because you are better at arguing, doesn't mean you're right. i was √† german living in england for 7 years. loved it. but whenever i had a an argument with people about politics or whatever people would ""win"" the argument simply because they delivered better than i did.

me arguing in a foreign language obviously makes it much harder for me to get my point across. but even in my own language i struggle to explain well. however i don't think just because i don't talk well or don't use difficult words or studder here and there should ever take away from the argument i'm making. if people weren't so obsessed with showing off how clever they are they would let their counterpart finish what they have to say and listen  instead of seeing their insecurities or shortcomings as an apportunity to make them look stupid or overpower them and ""win"" the argument.

"we need to let some pet breeds die out. we have destroyed what were once great creatures by selective breeding, and we need to let some of our ""creations"" die out.

breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

of course i don't mean all breeds of animals when i say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds i do mean:

french bulldogs, pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: these dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

munchkin cats: munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. if they had no health risks, i still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. but, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (hollowed chest), and lordosis (curved spine).

this isn't even hard to achieve. simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

but i doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

"the problem with dicussion on reddit is that negative karma encourages people to stop debating and go to subreddits that agree with them. negative karma discourages people from arguing against the majority view on a subreddit and instead going to a different subreddit where they are the majority view.

this happens because when you share these unpopular opinions; your comments get hidden making it harder for people to listen to what you say, especially for new users without much karma it can very easy to get banned, and users with unpopular opinions face a very hostile reaction in those subreddits.

unfortunately there is an easy alternative, where you run to a subreddit which is the complete opposite, the majority agrees with you on your statements, you have the support of the community and positive reinforcement where people encourage you on.

this is poor for dicussion for many reasons but undoubtedly the most important is that people aren't as challenged on their ideas and beliefs drastically lowering the overall quality of discussion.

i would argue that my position is a minority argument and that most redditors would instead put the discussion problem down to the nature of argument on the site being very reactionary, with relatively little knowledge on the given subject matter.

"if you're pro-choice, then you need to support the right to assisted suicide it's the same concept imo. for women, it's their body and they have the right to choose whether or not to keep the child. i think the same concept should apply to suicide. if someone is miserable, depressed, chronically ill, disabled, etc, then it should be 100% their choice to end their lives. it's inhumane to force people to take their own lives using makeshift methods which can result in brain damage or permanent injury (shotgun, nitrogen gas, etc). obviously there should be safeguards to prevent spur of the moment suicides after a traumatic event or something, but the option for a safe, sanctioned suicide should be there after proper vetting.

this is just an excuse we've given ourselves to be lazy and selfish about our commitments. the reason marriages and relationships fail so often now is people think they'll find their ""soulmate"" - and once they find this perfect, special soulmate, they'll get married and live happily ever after like some sort of disney fairytale. what a joke. but this is really ingrained in our culture. think hard and take an honest look, and you'll probably realize it's ingrained in you, too.

the fact is, marriage - even marriages between extremely good and compatible people - take hard work. they take commitment. they take sacrifice, honesty, and humility.

what does it mean to put work and sacrifice into your marriage?

\*it means... not scrolling through the facebook or ig pages of your ex-lovers or old crushes. saying ""no"" to silly thoughts like ""if i was with this other guy/girl....things would be perfect.""

\*it means... not giving yourself excuses to step out on your wife or husband. ""she/he was mean to me."" ""i deserve this."" ""she doesnt love me anyway. i can sleep with someone else now."" - nope. you made a commitment. stick by it and work on your issues.

\*it means... putting down the video games, the tv controller, the football game, the beer bottle, etc. and instead doing something nice for your spouse, such as the dishes or cleaning out the car. 

\*it means... not using your intimate knowledge of the other person to inflict pain and harm on them during arguments, but instead holding back and learning to express your frustration in a healthy way that doesnt cause severe damage to the relationship.

"john lennon was a piece of crap person and a piece of crap singer who doesn't deserve the hype around his life. he was a known wife beater who often flew into uncontrollable fits of rage that he directed to the various women in his life.  lennon resented his son julian, and narcissisticly blamed the boy for a marriage he did not want to be in. after lennon divorced his wife, he took off with yoko ono and dropped out of his son's life for years. julian has stated that paul mccartney was far more of a father to him than john ever was. 

john was a pathological liar who claimed he had been raised in a working class family in liverpool when he was actually raised in a comfortable upper middle class home. he often claimed to be single during his early years of stardom, despite being married. he claimed to have met yoko ono at an art show; falling in love at first sight, when in fact, ono had stalked him for months before he gave in to her.

john claimed to have lost interest in the beatles due to paul mccartney's tendencies toward pop music when in fact, he had spent two years in a daze as a result of a serious addiction to heroin. together, he and yoko  destroyed the beatles, then he blamed the breakup on paul mccartney. 

he was politically clueless and gave money to publicity violent and radical groups such as the black panthers.

he was no better than an average guitar player who mostly confined his playing to the basic rhythm parts and his piano playing was amateurish. 
his song writing was no better;  the lyrics to strawberry fields forever and come together are pure drug induced hippie psychedelic babble.

lennon was a raging hypocrite who lived the do as i say, not as i do life perhaps more flamboyantly than anyone. all you have to do is look at his songs. lennon, who sang imagine no possessions lived a millionaire's life in a posh new york hotel.  lennon sang imagine no religion, while he was was obsessed with every spiritual and new age fad that came along, including hindu meditation, the i-ching, and astrology of all kinds.  and it was lennon who sang all you need is love, yet lived a violent, and angry life while abusing his family and friends. and it was lennon who sang about having nothing to kill or die for helped finance radical and violent political groups.

lennon was a piece of shit and the world should know this about him.

"obese children are abused children parents that feed their child a poor diet and cause them to be obese should be treated the same as anti-vaxxer parents. imo they are both abusing someone who has no say in their health regards and are exposing them to possible health issues in the future. among some of the things these children are exposed to are risk of diabetes type 2, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. this is not even taking into consideration the lack of self esteem and bullying the child might endure growing up. everyone says, look at the cute fat baby, but no one ever says, look at that fat cute teenager. 

edit: some of you are pointing out that this is the 10th time this type of opinion is posted. i honestly did not know. my inspiration came from a patient i saw this morning. he was mid 20's and 340 lbs. he was complaining of knee and leg pain. we had a conversation and he told me he was big since childhood because his parents fed him mcdonalds every day. i was not taking into consideration medical reasons or low income families. i was actually thinking about kids like him that the parents, out of laziness or convenience, just fed him junk food.",6

"spamming suicide hotline numbers at depressed people or suicidal people doesn't seem that helpful. you know the last thing i think most suicidal or depressed people want to hear is? you need to talk to someone. you should talk to a therapist. you should call this hotline. 

you think they haven't fucking thought of that? no shit. it's the first thing anyone says when someone is depressed; you should talk to a therapist.

honestly? i don't think there's a way to measure it, but if someone calls that hotline i don't think they were going to do it anyways (other than the ones that called it and did it on the call).

it's just annoying to me that when people say they're depressed and society sucks, and they joke about (or are serious about) killing themselves, no one ever offers real solutions but just says ""call this random number and talk to someone, oh i just know how you feel i've been there before""


edit: this seems split in terms of popularity. i'm gonna take this time to lay out what worked for me. feel free to tell me i'm an idiot, but i swear to god this worked for me. you know what pulled me out of my slump? realizing all of these other styles of help were bullshit, and that it was entirely my own mental state. if i was going to get out of it, i was going to have to be the one to make changes. at face value it sounds silly, but i really internalized this idea. i forced myself to stop relying on other people for my own happiness. it made me a more cynical person towards society as a whole, but damnit if it didn't help i don't know what did. realizing society's shortcomings were what put me in that place to begin with made me understand that in order to overcome, i was going to be the only one that could truly change my own personal mental well being. i took this mentality to heart, and started focusing on things like hobbies. it wasn't easy, but i spent my time learning to do things like play guitar, or build circuits, or get really good at a certain video game, or produce beats, etc. this idea may be a crock of shit, but i gave this advice to another one of my depressed friends telling them i thought the advice people generally give is bullshit. i actually found that giving a bleak response of understanding and being real with them and not being all ""yeah, talk to someone!"" etc. was more helpful. if you can actually relate to how that depressed person feels instead of just telling them everything will be okay, you have a better chance of helping. they don't want to hear ""everything is okay"", they want to hear ""yeah you're right everything really is fucked."" if you can truly relate to them and the way they feel without trying to tell them how to fix it explicitly, they'll appreciate it.

edit 2: i should have been more explicit when i wrote this. i'm sure hotlines help some people, i'm not saying they don't. i'm also not saying therapy doesn't help people.

edit 3: here's an analogy. your friend is in a hole (depression). you're standing outside of the hole. you're shouting phone numbers down into the hole and saying things like ""you're gonna be fine, it's okay"". in reality, it would be much more helpful if you could jump into the hole with them and show them the way out.

"if businesses only have to pay taxes on profit, not revenue. then i should only have to pay taxes after i've paid all my bills and rent. businesses do not pay taxes on their gross revenue, they get to go to the irs and say, ""well this is what we paid paid our vendors, paid our staff and our bills, so we dont pay tax on this"". great, so it allows business to not have to pay taxes before they've taken out the costs of doing business.

regular joe however, pays taxes on their gross income which is massively unfair compared to businesses, my rent, food, bills and transport costs are also my cost of doing business. they are not optional, without those i cannot earn the money to make the salary i am paid.

the irs wouldnt have extra work to do either, they already look at tax submissions of businesses and see what their revenue and deducted business expenses were, they could do that for you and me too.

edit: to clarify, my criticism isn't that businesses should be taxed more, that's not what i want. people should be taxed less using the same deductions.",6
"i'm tired of the racism and heterophobia coming from ""woke"" poc and lgbtq+ communities i'm a pansexual black/cuban poet who has been doing slam poetry for 5 years. throughout these 5 years i've seen so many people who swore they were ""woke"" proceed to do a poem that isn't much more than hating white people and bashing straight people. at the end of these poems, most poc go insane with applause, and the white people in the room all clap along too, even though they've done nothing but try to be an ally. 

this kind of behavior can be seen on social media too.  a person of color can post anything about white people. they can post anything from a joke that uses white people as the punch line to straight up saying ""i hate white people"" and be fine. same thing with queer people and straight people. 

and i get it. i'm black, cuban, queer, and a woman. i'm made up of two races that have been enslaved, tortured, and shunned. my gender has been put down for centuries. i would've had to force myself into the closet if i was born a couple of centuries earlier. i know what it's like to be hated for who i am. i know what it's like to feel angry for what's been done to my ancestors, and my queer brothers, sisters, and siblings. but i don't compliment these poems. i don't applaud. i don't like these posts. because it's wrong. this is the same kind of ignorant hate being flung by the homophobes and racists on the other end. this is all just tit for tat. 

you're not woke if you:

- make racist/ sexist/ straight bashing jokes and can't take it back in your direction. 

-use generalizations like ""all white people"" or ""all straight people"" but then get mad when someone uses generalizations like ""all black people"" or ""all queer people. 

-refuse to talk or communicate with someone simply because they're a white straight cis man but then feel angry that someone doesn't want to interact with you because you're a queer person of color. 

-push allies away when they're trying to help you. 

-think you're better than anyone because of your identity. 

everyone has the right to be who they want. to be proud of their identity. you have no control over what you are and who you are and you shouldn't be hated and put down for it. but you shouldn't put another person down just to lift yourself up. 

next time you write a status or a poem about the ""other"" side, insert blanks on every time you name them. insert something represents you into the blanks. then read the poem and visualize someone from the ""other"" side reading it back to you. do you feel put down? that's what you're doing to others. 


tldr: love yourself but don't put other people down in the process.

"schools should not punish bullied kids for fighting back. if a kid gets physically hurt by a bully, i believe defending oneself should be allowed, since a slap on the wrist/detention will do almost nothing to make the bully ""see the light"" in his wrongdoings. a lot of people tend to disagree with this calling it barbaric, but why should a provoked kid who kept to himself be punished if he's reacting to what happened? also, the school's way of punishing a bully tends to be very counterproductive in general.

edited to add: well i went to sleep and this blew up. three things:

1) my issue is not with how the kids behave - they are too young to know better. their entitled ass parents however, should know better.

"a 'dislike' button on facebook would actually significantly change the world...for the better the title of this post might seem extreme on the surface, but i do believe this to be true. the absence of a dislike button on facebook warps public opinions on some serious matters, and i believe it also influences peoples own opinions.   


the only way to counter a comment you don't agree with or are offended by is to put an angry emoji or comment. the angry emoji is misleading and is often used to demonstrate your dislike of the subject at hand and not the comment itself. commenting just opens up arguments, abuse and takes time. giving people a 'dislike' option, very much like the down vote system on here would change this...  


imagine being a generally ignorant, racist, bigoted idiot and commenting something obscene online? you might post a comment that really offends 18,000 out of 20,000 people, but it shows 2k likes by like minded idiots. this sends out the wrong message. this tells people who are just passing that the opinion is popular, there is a lack of balance without the effort of commenting and getting involved in a spat. add the dislike function and suddenly the comment has 2k likes but 18k dislikes, which tells people that this is an unpopular view point and might make people think twice about what they say, or take a rain check on their attitudes.  


it would give people the freedom to disagree without engaging, it would add balance to the site, and considering how much political debate there is on there at the moment, i think it is important.  


yes i know its a social media site, but we have to take it seriously now. it influences people, some people live on there. facebook impacts the world.

"(unpopular for cannabis users) i think weed culture is awful. i use cannabis everyday, i would be considered a ""stoner"" by most people. weed culture is childish, cringy and counterproductive to the destigmatization of this wonderful drug. i would rather kick myself in the balls than own anything with a cannabis leaf drawn on it, wether it's shirt, a hat, an ashtray, a rolling tray, a poster a tattoo, a bong or a fucking sticker. people whose apparent jobs are to smoke weed on youtube make me sick and if you look at recipes for edibles they will invade your reccomended videos.

 i went to a legal shop here in montreal and left slmost immediately due to the overwhelming douche baggery happening in there. they turned bob marley, a man who sang songs of love and unity, and turned him into a mass marketed caricature who seemed to have only cared about weed. every mention of 420 makes me roll my eyes, if anything, canadians should celebrate 10/17 (the day cannabis was legalized federally). and dealers in general are insufferable weed snobs.

"the real ""alpha"" males tend to be respectful and chill people. it's the guys with insecurities and problems trying to be ""alpha"" who are assholes. growing up, i was in a position where i was always going through some sort of adversity whether it be family, school, illness, ect. and there were days where i wasn't putting my 100% game face and attitufe outside the house. 

i notice that my acquaintances and friends who tend to be very accomplished people, and are the epitome of the successful man tended to be some of the realest and most genuine people around me. for example the traits they shared would be: athletic accomplishments in sports, lifting, strong career and academic goals, involvement in clubs and student activities (both in hs and college), traveling, open mindedness, self created good appearance (due to taking care of self and clothing), and humble/positive personalities. i've had lab mates who went to oxford and harvard who i wouldn't have even suspected gone to such schools, because when you talk to them,  they wanted to know about you and really laid back people. you know they're awesome people from just the way they carry themselves.

i had former friends and acquaintances who were the opposite. for example one example of a former close i had was somebody who barely got through high school and participated in nothing back then. after, he would be extremely stubborn about getting a job, going to a job training program, or putting himself in positions to meet new people, ect. his ass was just sitting around broke and always creating drama with other people, while mooching off others. he did not work out much, yet bragged constantly about his childhood accomplishments, claiming to have played 10 different sports. he always talked about being alpha and tried to act like the top dog around others. people initially are drawn to his charm and good social skills, but over time they see the truth that he's just a total loser. in the neighborhood i grew up with there were a lot of people like the one guy i described above.

"accused rapists should have the same anonymity as rape victims until proven guilty. with the difficulty in proving rape cases due to evidence being largely testimonial, many accused rapists are judged in the public eye rather than the courts. as the basis of the law is innocent until proven guilty and lived can be ruined based upon false accusations, defendants should remain nameless unless it's in the public interest. 

naming accused brings few benefits besides other victims/witnesses potentially coming forward and warning the public while the trial is under way. obviously due to the nature of the crime, each cases is different and exceptions will apply. however with many details of trials hidden, the general public tends to make their decision if the accused is guilty based upon very little evidence. this can essentially amount to mob rule even if they are eventually proven innocent, reputations can be irreparable.

"""my body my choice"" isn't a good argument against pro-life people gonna start this off by immediately saying i am pro choice, and not going to get into debates about that here. i just want to say people who keep repeating the lines ""it is my body"" and ""it is my choice"" aren't going to sway any pro-life people to come to your side.

pro-life people believe that a fetus is alive, and aborting it is akin to murder, they don't see a difference between aborting a 2 month old fetus and killing a just born baby. so repeating the same lines at them over and over again with the assumption they agree a fetus isn't its own being with its own rights is just going to piss them off.

"journalism is no longer and honest and legitimate profession, and should be treated as such. granted, i know historically journalists have had their share of ""yellow journalism"" and other poor moments. i also know everyone's got opinions on what the ""news"" actually is -- fox, cnn, i don't care, let's put politics aside for a moment to look at other agenda-pushing bs. consider how many reputations the media has tarnished in their crusade for a headline. consider how many ""scares"" we've had because journalists take one potentially interesting tidbit from a story or a study or something and twist and twist until its a big fucking deal, when it really should have been treated as the molehill it was.

journalism is just activism in sheep's clothing. why? because juicy stories sell to the masses. journalists should be treated with the same skepticism nowadays as used car salesmen, and perhaps more so.

"people that sexually starve their partners shouldn't be surprised when they cheat. so the most common time this happens is in long term relationships.

let me just say now that this is both men that cheat and women that cheat, not exclusively for 1 sex.

i understand that some people have different sex drives, however if your so has said they they feel this way and you acknowledge it and nothing changes, that person shouldn't be surprised that the person would go outside of the relationship to look for intimate relations.

"unattractive people should learn to accept that they're not attractive rather than delude themselves that they are. ""everybody is beautiful to somebody."" 

""ugly doesn't exist."" 

""everybody is equally attractive in their own way."" 

""looks don't even matter. what's on the inside determines whether you're attractive or not.""

""you're perfect just the way you are."" 


these quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people. it's like everyone needs to believe they're attractive or else. god forbid anyone ever see themselves as less-than-beautiful. 

but... why? is being unattractive that bad? is attractiveness a person's only value to humanity? are the lies necessary?

sure, in a utopia, everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly. but alas, this is planet earth and life isn't fair. some people are born with attractive features; some are not. some are born with blatantly unattractive features. yes, that's nobody's fault, but that's just the way it is. 

before you say ""beauty is subjective"", you can't deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings. for men they would be tall height, broad shoulders, full hair, clear skin, and facial symmetry+harmony. for women: clear skin, full hair, hairlessness, facial symmetry+harmony, and a good waist-hip ratio. aside from certain fetishists, i've yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites. 

not only would people stop lying to themselves if they accepted their unattractiveness; they would no longer have to wonder ""what am i doing wrong?"" when they find that others don't view them how they view themselves.",6

i understand that (at least in the states) a lot of the time it is cheaper to buy junk food, but this isn't a good argument because you can still lose weight with junkfood. for the overwhelming majority of people weight loss comes down to calories in being fewer than calories out. 


and on taking kids away from parents i agree there should be some steps before that happens. there should be serious health impacts before this happens, and some kind of intervention in the form of a diet/exercise plan given to the family to follow. but if you're gonna let your kid get diabetes at 16 then yea, they should be taken away.

"judging people by their looks works well for the vast majority of cases. so here's the thing: looks are not something that just randomly fell into place or whatever, but they are to a large part the result of choices and efforts made. for example, if you are well kept and wear a professional outfit, you're probably someone that cares a lot about impressions and your career, and most likely you have a fairly conservative outlook on life. equally, if you look like a stoner or like you don't care about your looks, then that also says something about your values and beliefs. there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it's just obvious. if you are a woman, cut your hair short, and dye it three different colors, it's also not too hard to guess your political leanings. same for someone running around in polo shirts and boat shoes only.

sending food to countries that can't feed themselves only makes the problem worse. the root of the problem is these people can't feed themselves. feeding them only allows them to keep reproducing, creating even more mouths that can't be fed. either teach these people to farm or let them starve. if they aren't capable of farming, survival of the fittest. 

parts of africa are like the crazy cat lady. she sees a few starving cats and thinks this is horrible, so she feeds them. pretty soon they reproduce and she has even more cats to feed. what started out as a few starving cats turns into 50 starving cats. she hasn't solved a problem she just made it worse. she had good intentions but didn't stop cats from starving, she just created more starving cats.

"if your girlfriend refuses to do something sexually with you that she has willingly done for her previous boyfriend/s, you should break up with her. for the record, i'm not talking about things she tried once with an ex, but never did again because she genuinely didn't like it (although, an argument could be made for her letting you try at least once, too).

what i am talking about is any act she willingly performed for an ex that she either enjoyed or was at least indifferent to (i.e. she had no negative feelings about it).

&#x200b;

there are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good.

&#x200b;

the first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you. he is so important that even though the relationship is over, there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and, in her mind, giving those things to you would feel like cheating. i know, crazy right?

&#x200b;

the second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex. you are second best in her estimation; good enough to date, but not good enough to give all that she has to offer. does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in???

now, reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed, so let's make some thing's clear:

&#x200b;

1. no guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend, but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she won't fuck.
2. i'm not saying that a guy should say ""do this for me, or i'm leaving."" i'm saying that, once he finds out that she's holding out on him sexually, he should move on. that relationship is toxic, and you can be sure that sex isn't the only thing she's keeping from him.
3. this obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex, i only picked men and sex because i tend to hear about that situation more often.
4. obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesn't want to do.
5. if both the guy and the girl are refusing to give each other things that they willingly gave their ex's, then i guess it's a match made in heaven.

another guy had an ex that wouldn't do anal, but she talked about doing it with an ex and how much she liked it.

another guy wasn't getting blowjobs, but found out from a mutual friend that his girlfriend loved giving them to an ex.

there are more, but they're all pretty much the same story.",6
"toxic femininity is worse than toxic masculinity in recent years we have seen a rise in complaints relating to the behaviour of men and how it can be construed as toxic. the current movements have brought a deeper focus towards this and have created changes, some for the better and some for the worse. but during this time the very people marching against man have completely ignored their own toxic behaviours and a failure to address these would be worry some. women seem to want equality, but do not want to change their own bad behaviours.

when you think of toxic masculinity you are primarily speaking about mansplaining, manspreading, sexual violence or the boys will be boys argument. the whole movements seems to target the role of men as the dominant sex.

&#x200b;

but when you look at toxic femininity there is a much wider scope of problems that show up. a lot of toxic behaviours can easily outweigh most of what these people consider to be toxic masculinity. a few examples being;

* blaming behavioural issues on periods
* acting helpless at times where some physically demanding or unpleasant task comes up
* coercing men into sex who didn't seem to really want it and feeling as though you were at liberty to do so because ""men always want it""
* backed up by studies, women are far more likely to threaten harm to themselves, others or property if a man attempts to leave a relationship
* being physically abusive to men while expressing ""men can't hit women"" and being less likely to face any legal consequences for doing so
* lying about pregnancies or being on birth control to see how a man would respond or to manipulate them into staying
* manipulating divorce and custody battles by falsely insisting that a man has been abusive to you or a child.

&#x200b;

some of these examples are minor toxic offences, like blaming bad behaviour on hormones. it's normal, it happens, but it is no excuse all the same. some of these examples are major toxic offences. such as using your gender or children as a weapon to influence decision to go your way.

one of the most common offences of toxic femininity is attempting to convince the world that toxic femininity does not exist.

"dear humans: vanilla is not ""plain"", ""boring"", or ""flavorless"". it *is* a flavor, and a rich one at that. (blame ice cream's history) when you are served ice cream, you are served vanilla as the ""default"" ice cream. and it is white, a word often synonymous with ""blank"" or ""empty"". this made kids everywhere assume that vanilla is just the ordinary and boring. but it's not.

it really doesn't help that in the u.s., major food companies are penny-pinching jerks who make cheaper-tasting flavor (and who also ruin people's understanding of ""american cheese"", a cheese which-- when you make it right-- is a good contender with any other flavorful cheeses you see on the shelf every day.) vanilla was once described in europe as the ""essence and epitome of flavor"". that's why it became so common. and over time, vanilla was widely substituted with cheaper things. ""natural vanilla flavor"" isn't vanilla. it's a natural flavor that tastes kinda like it (and often comes from something you don't want to hear about, not that i think there's anything wrong with substitute flavors in general). real vanilla is fantastic.

stop misrepresenting vanilla. it's a great flavor. (although i know that software terms are already dooming ""vanilla"" to continue being thought of as ""boring"", and there's nothing i can do to fix that. as if ""vanilla minecraft"" is even boring... sigh.)",6

"telling men to not be afraid of a false rape accusation because it's statistically unlikely doesn't help anything, because that's not why we are really afraid. anyone who pays attention to the news, at all, should remember the cluster fuck that was the kavanaugh hearings. resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs, on the opinion pages of news sites, and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well. 

the conversation went as such: if you're afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you, you're wrong to do so because it's so rare, and you're a shitty person to do so because that means you don't care about women. furthermore, even men who *are* falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways!

yeah. no shit. the reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is *undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise* (which is rare) **or** *the accuser confesses that the accusation was false* (which is usually the case). so... of course the legal system will not give charges based on a *certifiable false statement.* 

what isn't outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support *either* scenario. the implication in providing the ""they're really rare"" statistic was it *implied the remaining allegations were true.* in effect, it was a lie by omission. 

and the above really isn't my point anyways. here's the main point:

*in a false accusation, the false accuser is rarely punished. there are very little, if any, repercussions to a false female rape accuser if she's found to be lying.*

so, why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if *his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isn't, even if she's caught in the lie?* where's the deterrent there? 

another question that i have never once seen given a good answer:

how does a man prove verbal, unrecorded consent to sex? this is how *most* consent occurs anyways. other than his word, what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape? throw in radical feminism's insistence that consent can be revoked at any time, *even after sex*, then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it: intimacy with a woman. 

we have no defense, she gets no consequences..... and people are baffled as to why men, especially young men, are terrified of this? 

lastly: i want to be wrong. 

here's what you can do if i am: treat me as someone who has been lied to, and **prove why that's the case**, without being a piece of shit about it. try and see if you can avoid calling me an ""incel"" as that is the current insult in this regard i've found. 

i'm not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities, but rather know that i am *nowhere close* to being alone here. relentless condescension, name-calling, and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced they're right: it'll reinforce their position, and you won't even see them in the comments. you won't even see them outside the walls of a public conversation, or a heated exchange on facebook. talk to *them,* not *me...* in this case here on reddit at least.  

so, if i am wrong, convince the people not leaving comments, the ones listening, that i am... and see if you can do it in a way that doesn't make *you* look like part of *another* growing demographic: someone who doesn't even give a shit and could care less about men's concerns and fears.

"the word ""moist"" isn't gross. the circlejerk over it is ridiculous. there seems to be this meme of the word *moist* being inherently disgusting and creepy, and i don't get it. is ""damp"" really a better word to use? what sounds more appetizing, a *moist* cake or a *damp* cake?

personally i think the words *petulant* and *hemorrhage* are a little bit gross-sounding, but they are words for a reason and i'm not going to throw a conniption fit if somebody uses them. it's not like they're slurs.

edit: i might have been a bit harsh in my wording. i know it's just my opinion, and some people are grossed out by it. i understand why some people have a negative association with the word, but i just don't associate it with bodily fluids unless it's used in that context. obviously i'm not going to double down on using it if it truly does bother somebody. i'm not an asshole.

i mixed up the words *petulant* and *pustulent,* but the two words do sound somewhat similar. obviously the reasons *pustulent* and *hemorrhage* are gross sounding is because of what they mean. i'm not going to avoid them if i need to use either.",6
"the reason there's not many actual unpopular opinions on this is because people downvote actual unpopular opinions idc that this isn't an opinion because i know it's a fact. i know no one gives two shits about the rules and neither do i but you are supposed to upvote actual unpopular opinions and downvote popular opinions(contrary to what happens). so basically stop bitching about there being no unpopular opinions when you are part of the problem.

"you're a piece of shit if you try to get somebody fired for their off-work behavior. i keep seeing these posts where somebody posts something racist on social media and somebody contacts their employer to try and get them fired. it seems to be one of the first reactions or pieces of advice every time somebody feels wronged.

&#x200b;

people have the right to be a piece of shit outside of the work place. the punishment has no relation to the offense and its basically thought crime. its not any different than keying their car. it's cowardly and childish.

&#x200b;

you don't know that person's situation or who depends on them. that person could be supporting children or a sick relative. and getting them fired will likely embitter them and reinforce their beliefs.

there are obvious exceptions if there's implications for public safety or what not, but otherwise, if somebody can compartmentalize their behavior and be a good employee i really could not careless about what they do on their free time.

"women who are making fun of men for being offended by the gillette ad are being extremely hypocritical and it drives me mad. whether you agree with it or not, some men have taken offense to the things said and the ideas being pushed by the recent gillette advertisement. with these feelings being brought to light on social media i've started to see many different instances of women criticizing the feelings of these men stating that ""they should only be offended if they are the toxic male audience that gillette is criticizing"" and it drives me mad. why can every other group of people feel offended but when straight males are targeted and feel as if they are being unfairly portrayed it is socially acceptable to mock these claims for internet clout? why can't men feeling offended by something be considered legitimate?

south park in the other hand is topical, witty, often delving into serious topics in a way that is so absurd and humorous that you don't notice how good the points they are making are until you think about it later. through crude antics and exaggerated perspectives they actually manage to say something substantial. not only that, but often they show just how absurd something is bringing an almost absolute clarity to the issue they are covering and thus it is hard to argue against it using what you may have thought before was a solid point. and they do it in a way anyone can understand and digest.",6

"schools need to teach kids about acne, weight gain, showering, and inform them about what conditions we bully people for way more than we need half assed anti-bullying campaigns that do nothing. you have no idea how many kids think that acne is just a matter of washing your face or that they're just to lazy to get medication, or even that anything on the face is either acne or herpes. so many kids get bullied for something that 80% of people go through. acne is almost exclusively caused by hormones, and while washing twice daily (or possibly three if it's extremely greasy) can help *if proper cleaners are used* it won't get rid of it for most people. i had sensitive skin, like extremely sensitive, many people do, and i had tried about 20 different medications and washes and all of them burned until i cried so i was forced to give up, not to mention that was a huge expense every month some families might not be able to spare. different things work for different people, sometimes nothing works. turns out i didn't even have acne. i have a very common condition called kp, that looks like acne (causes redness, bumps, small ""whiteheads"" that are actually filled with keratin not pus) and has no cure or good treatment other than just growing out of it. eating different foods has no effect on your acne as long as your overall diet is healthy. if you have good quality make-up it won't cause acne, some are even made to help. i could go on forever about myths that nobody knows, at least not until it's to late for them and those who they may have bullied.

weight gain for many kids is again not their fault. their parents aren't providing a healthy diet. these kids essentially have an addiction. the majority of kids who are overweight are eating that way due to stress. bullying has made them afraid of the gym, locker rooms, gym class, just excersize in genderal. also many people who may look overweight can be of perfectly fine bmi and extremely healthy. not saying the fat acceptance ""there's no such thing as obese"" is true, just that what we see isn't always right, and nobody deserves to get bullied for what is more than likely not their fault.

i knew a kid who never showered, it was because nobody taught him how to really scrub his hair or use shampoo, and he was in foster care so nobody taught him. same went for washing clothes, brushing teeth, using deodorant, while they seem rather evident to most of us, some families can't afford it and some kids simply don't have any family to learn it from. 

all in all, bullying largely comes from lack of knowledge and understanding. i'm pretty sure that if we simply taught kids about their own bodies in a way that went past ""here's how to probably not get a girl pregnant"" and ""this is a vegetable"" we would highly reduce bullying. did you know the average woman dislikes her breasts and 80% would get surgery? it is beyond normal to have slightly lopsided boobs, to have large areolas, inverted nipples, the ""average"" breast is in no way a perfect. did you know that the average man isn't capable of getting a six pack, that it is completely normal to have a slight fat buildup in your chest? we often don't talk about the unrealistic body expectations for men, but in no way whatsoever is the average man running around out there with enough muscle deffinition to look like he's made of cobblestone.

"we need to stop telling kids they can be whatever they want to be. hold up, just hear me out. i'm not saying we should destroy the dreams of kids, but i'm absolutely in favor of not over-inflating a child's hopes to the point where they can't cope with any future failure.

we should be realistic with children from a very young age. say things like, ""you can do so much"", ""the future has so many possibilities for you"", anything else besides the false promise of ""you can be literally anything you want to be""

"the word ""retarded"" shouldn't be offensive the fact that society is shying away from ""the r-word"" is proof of the so-called euphemism treadmill. basically, by replacing ""retarded"" with something else, we're just kicking the can down the road and it's a matter of time before the new word becomes offensive. 

not that long ago, the term ""retarded"" was considered a kind and politically correct way to replace words like ""idiot"" and ""imbecile"" (those were actually medical terms 75 or so years ago). 

the term ""special"" or ""special needs"" is probably the most common way of replacing ""retarded,"" but even those terms are becoming offensive (for example, conservatives sometimes derisively call progressives ""special snowflakes""). 

obviously human decency should prevent us from making fun of those with mental disabilities, but it just isn't necessary to tip-toe around those clunky terms that become offensive after a few years.

"it should be illegal for a pregnant woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigs while pregnant, and grounds for removal by child services. some may claim this isn't unpopular, but i think it is. bodily autonomy, no one owning a pregnant woman's body (not even the fetus growing inside of it), the fact that you can't even file a cps report for a follow up *after* the birth of a child to a woman who drank like a fish her whole pregnancy, or a woman who delivered prematurely due to their nicotine addiction. 

if you are pregnant and intend on carrying and birthing that child, you have a moral and ethical responsibility to make sure that baby is born as healthy as possible. it should be illegal for any woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes while she's growing a developing fetus. 

it should be punishable as felony child abuse or neglect if the child is born with any deformities or developmental issues related to the substance abuse (this is provable with medical expertise), and charged as a misdemeanor if not. at the very least, cps should be allowed to intervene before the child is born, and remove the child upon birth. 

edit: for those who keep bring it up, no, weening after a few weeks when you know you're pregnant would not be ground for removal in this scenario. this applies to those who have no intent of quitting, and exhibit no attempt at quitting either behaviors. common sense would still be applied by cps.

"if your child is obese (outside of medical reasons) it should be considered child abuse. 
imo a dr or teacher should be able to contact cps for an investigation if a (young) child is morbidly obese. 

last night i saw 2 small children, brother and sister, who looked around 5 and 8 years old who were both massively overweight. it broke my heart to see them struggling to play, breathing heavily, and see their overweight mom hand then candy bars and chips. 

i don't know their circumstances and for the most part, i am indifferent to other's choices in raising their children. however, there is no reason a child that age should be obese (aside from a medical condition). a child that age is not in control of what they are given to eat and if you as their parent are over-feeding them junk to the point of childhood obesity, some sort of child abuse should be suggested. 

these poor kids have to grow up with the consequences of your bad eating habits and you are setting them up for health problems later in life. 

edit: thank you for mentioning the factors i naively missed such as poverty, the effects of corporations targeting children, and people who don't know better. these points are very valid and make a lot of sense. perhaps if counselors, teachers, doctors had the ability to become more involved in extreme situations (as some can with underweight, starving children) this could be a good place to start. 

i had no idea this was a ""re-post"". 

as anyone, i am speaking from my own experience and i did come from a family who struggled with money. i don't know how my parents managed to keep our meals balanced.

"reddit is not a bastion of free speech, and is actually highly censored by the wrong people. hear me out.

i originally came here because i heard that reddit was built upon free speech and free thinking. that was a lie.

subreddit communities can make lists of rules and whatnot to make clear what kind of things they don't want on their sub, and that's okay.

the problem with the rules and independent moderation of reddit is that, subs are just using their lists of rules as generalizations which in turn become excuses to censor people who don't agree with them. 

generally, once you start talking about things that rustle the mods' jimmies, they will ban you. it doesn't matter if you've broken one of their rules or not, they'll just pick the rule they think is closest to what you're saying and use that as their excuse. worse yet, sometimes they don't even give a reason, or they flat out admit they just don't like what you're saying. 

most moderators just want safe spaces. they usually don't even want a safe space for their audience, they just want safe spaces for themselves, because god forbid you post something they disagree with in their subreddit, whether  you're breaking the rules or not, they'll find a reason to get rid of you.

all of this is made worse by the fact that generally the ones censoring are heavily liberal, as most people that use reddit are. (being liberal is okay, i'm a moderate, so i don't really care). both sides of the political spectrum have both good and bad ideas, but only a weak person would try to censor everything that doesn't agree with their liberal agenda. i've seen conservatives do it too. just not as much. sometimes the censorship isn't even politically motivated, people just get butthurt.

the icing on the cake is that reddit administrators are extremely liberal and will always 100% side with mods, especially if they're trying to create a safe space. 

reddit puts on this mask of ""the last bastion of free speech on the internet "" when in reality they're creating the biggest censorship atrocity on the internet. i have faith in time it will die.

censorship will kill reddit.

safe spaces will kill reddit. 

cancerous moderation will kill reddit.

also so many of the people that give people shit calling them losers or nerd for playing things like league of legends or d&d are these sports nerds. there's guys that will wear a jersey of their favorite team out to dinner just because, if they saw someone wearing a cosplay in the same setting they'd probably give them unrelenting shit.

again nothing wrong with being a sports fan, but let's call a spade a spade. sports fanatics are nerds too, they need to embrace it. 

edit: getting a lot of replies because i included psychology, i have a psych degree myself just saying if you don't go to grad school it doesn't help much finding jobs.

edit 2: lots of furry hate on here, which it's funny how random that is. but the point i'm trying to make is live and let live.  

edit 3: hey, hey, hey, this is not an opportunity to rip on people who like sports either, the main point i'm trying to make is live and let live. if you're tearing into ""sports jocks"" for being unintelligent on here then you're just as bad as the guys who this post was initially targeting. 

edit 4: if you're going to call this out for not being unpopular check the comments, there is a large amount of dissenting opinions. just because you personally agree doesn't mean something isn't widely unpopular ",6
"the poop-themed stuff that's popular with kids right now is repulsive. and down right stupid. if you send your kid to school wearing a shirt that has a pile of shit on it, you're a fucking clown. i think it started with the poop emoji (üí©), but lately i've been seeing kids with poop clothes, toys, games, etc. a friend of mine is even throwing his four year old daughter a poop-themed birthday party. i find all of it disgusting. no part of me thinks it's even remotely funny or cute. the fact that there's an entire trend based off of human feces baffles me. i can't wait until it blows over. maybe i'm an asshole, i don't know, but it needs to stop.

"any reason is a valid reason to not date someone. imo there is no wrong and invalid reason to not date someone. dating and relationships as a whole are entirely based around personal preference. its perfectly fine to not date someone   for any reason, as it all comes down to personal preference.

don't want to date a white person? cool

don't want to date a poor person? cool

don't want to date a muslim? cool

relationships come down to personal preference and as such all reasons are valid ones for why you don't want to date someone.",6
"if two drunk people have sex it makes no sense for people to validate one person as being assaulted or raped i see this more when its a girl accusing the guy of rape, but the fact that its socially accepted is horrifying to me. if two parties are both wasted and have sex how can one person be a rapist? the logic of too drunk to consent would make them both rapists? i will never understand this or accept it. i agree that there are some situations where maybe past behaviour indicates rapey tendencies but if its a one off event and the girl is accusing the guy of rape that should rightfully be taken with a grain of salt if they were both drunk. reduced judgement capacity due to intoxication would apply to both parties and its purely the social construction of women being vulnerable or weak that assumes the woman was taken advantage of by the man. i cannot express this to people without being called anti-women (im a woman yall) or brainwashed by patriarchal western society. 

edit: i've read some of the comments on my post and there are some things i think i should clarify. i absolutely am aware of the low conviction rate of rape cases but people seem to forget the power of social media and in general gossip which is a different kind of punishment that follows you for life. i have also personally seen someone be accused of rape after a drunken hookup and because theres an assumption that questioning anything a possible rape victim may say is considered callous and generally horrible everyone rallied around her (except me) regardless of what we all saw. im not commenting on the efficacy and complexity of the legal system as it pertains to rape cases, but making an observation based on what i have seen and what i believe to be an ultimately illogical line of reasoning in this very specific situation.

"i like it when my sleeves get wet when i wash my hands. whenever i wash my hands i don't roll up my sleeves, and instead i allow the nice cold water to embrace my sleeves. like it just feels really cool and nice when my sleeves are wet and sticking to my skin. i make sure that a good inch or two of my sleeves are wet. especially on a hot day this is useful, since it basically feels like free air conditioner.

"people who say you should like tomatoes if you like ketchup are complete idiots. ketchup isnt the exact equivalent of tomatoes just because it contains it. its processed and contains other things such as vinegar, sweeteners, salt and even onion or garlic. the actual fruit doesnt have those characteristics therefore they are different. its just dumb.",6
"youtube wanting to take away the dislike button is a big deal and should be treated as such. it's the only source of leverage that we as a creative community have. if that thing gets removed, youtube officially sells its soul to the advertisers. and yes i know they did that a long time ago. but this is one of the last old features that they will be removing from youtube.

this is a big deal.

the worst part is that we can't do anything about it.",6
"international women's day should focus more on improving the quality of lives and education of the women who suffer the most versus western feminists patting each other on the back for being women. the people whose voices need to be heard the most are the voiceless women who suffer under patriarchy and poverty. i will not deny the achievements and accomplishments of women that have pave the way for future generations - they should be celebrated - but i personally feel more accomplished striving for the equality and success of women who have way less than i do in my western comforts. it feels a mockery to not focus on what we can do improve their lives say for example the yazidi women's only commune in the aftermath of isis. my comments do not refer to the #metoo movements or other similar topics.

edit: let me be clear, i'm not criticizing feminism. i am however saying feminist should not make this day about our(western)selves when we still have so much work to do helping women who need it most achieve their rights.",6
