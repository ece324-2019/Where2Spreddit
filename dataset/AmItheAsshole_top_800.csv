"meta: this sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world. i've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and i feel like i've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. over time, more and more of the posts seem to have a- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and b- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

given that, i think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

so just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

they'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. they'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

the internet has its own values, and that's fine. but in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? people who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? people who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? the people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

so yeah. i love this sub, i love reading the stories and i find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. but i personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people i know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. i don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

so even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. and maybe this is just me, but i really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. that's a discussion worth having too.

edit: thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. and lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

edit 2: i've never seen this movie, but it's come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent tl,dr: ""you're not wrong walter, you're just an asshole""",3
"update, for despising my mentally handicap sister?. i'm back like i said i would be,. my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

well, since that day i made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. the week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

i started by telling my grandpa the story of why i broke down the way i did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. no one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. my grandpa told me some things that i don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this i was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. with everything else i told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. he pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when i sat down with them. it didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. this included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

suffice to say, this week has been rough. but, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. my grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things i want to do. my aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

well, saturday night i sat down with parents to talk. it went badly to say the least. they came clean to me about everything. they told me things i will not repeat here. but they did not apologize. my parents still claim that i some how owed my sister my time. my father even saying ""you were put here to be her caretaker"". i won't lie and say i was composed. after everything i learned i confronted them. on the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. the money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. they denied it or made excuses. and in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

today will be my last time talking to them for a while. after talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, i'm not going back. later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. when i graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. my aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. my parents have called me twice since saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when i was coming home.

i won't be going back to them. right now i still feel pretty uneasy about everything but i feel like that will pass. the rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. but in the end i lost my parents. over all of this, i've learned something that i wished i saw earlier. i don't hat my sister. in fact i love her with all my heart. i should never have never projected my hate onto her. that was wrong, and someday i hope to make up for it. but for now i need to leave.

so, there's my update. thanks again for the support my original post got. i really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. thanks you.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all so much! i wish i could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. i'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. i want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.

&#x200b;

late edit: wow, i never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. i know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. 

&#x200b;

we just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. every thing i wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. i have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record i could think of. my parents were quiet the whole time i was there. shorty after i arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. it took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. i hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. even now i sit here and think if she really meant it. after this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. i hope she meant it. right now though, i think i just need to look ahead. maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. i hope so.

&#x200b;

thank you all for the advice and love. it's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience i at least got some positive out of this mess. will i come back? i don't know. if something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. but for now i'm going to move on. for all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and i hope to see you on the other side. see you space cowboy's :)",3
"update: for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that i helped get addicted to drugs?. i want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. everyone's comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. 

since i received such great advice on my original post, i felt like i had an obligation to update. and i'm trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. 

the funeral service was held this past thursday. before then, i brought all the advice i received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how i was feeling and what i should do. 

my sponsor was straight with me and told me that i would be putting myself in danger by going and that i should do something else that day to grieve. 

when thursday rolled around, i was a mess. i seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead i grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. 

we went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. 

i'm doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. 

i haven't reached out to any of marcy's family and i don't plan to. i understand now how devastating that would be. 

that's it. take care everyone.",3
"meta: too many commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth.. i've become frustrated with how quick a lot of commenters are to encourage op's to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. while leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

when we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for love, empathy, understanding, and communication. these capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our ""throw-away"" consumer society. i often get a feeling that many commenters don't have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. ",3
"for making a dad joke?. note. my step-daughter, madeline, was about a year old when i married her mother, jessica. madeline's father died before she was born. 
 
madeline is currently 15, and she's rebelling for almost everything. she did something bad, so while picking her up, i set a punishment up for her. then she said ""you're not my dad. i don't have to follow you"". honestly, i got a bit hurt from that. but i understand that she didn't mean it, and that she'd probably change. i just replied ""i'm still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules."" 
 
that happened about 2 days ago. so our family was going grocery shopping, when madeline said ""i'm hungry. i need food."" i decide to be extremely cheeky and say ""hi hungry, i'm not your dad."" my son just started to laugh uncontrollably. my daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. and my wife was berating me ""not to stoop down to her level."" 
 
i honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. and my son agrees. so aita?
 
edit: i did adopt her. so legally i am her parent.

 
mini update: i'll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. i go to my daughter's room after dinner and begin talking with her. ""hey. i'm really sorry that i hurt you by the words i said. and i am really your dad. i changed your diapers, i met your boyfriend, and i plan on helping you through college. and plus i'm legally your dad, so we're stuck together. but seriously, i'm going to love you like my daughter even if you don't think i'm your dad. then i hugged her. she did start to cry. i assume that's good.",3
"for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?. we had a family dinner this evening. my family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29f), younger sister (24f) and youngest brother (22m).

extended family attended our family dinner. so all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. during the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. my sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. the two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

eventually my sister got really fed up and said ""shut up, i'm not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin."" my brother hadn't done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. i think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

anyway, i immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. she replied by saying everyone knows he's a virgin and she didn't say anything wrong. this annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn't need to be made fun of like this.

so i responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it's not a big deal right? turns out her husband didn't know this amazingly, i genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

family is blaming me for their marital problems. i refuse to accept i did anything wrong. my sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all i did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",3
"for suggesting my 7yo name his new stuffed tiger ""tig bitties""?. pretty much the title. my son won a stuffed tiger at the fair last night and said he had named him ""tig"". he asked me what its last name should be. i couldn't help myself and just instantly replied ""bitties"". then i turned to my wife to share a smirk, but she was pissed and quickly suggested a few different last names, but my son insisted that he liked ""bitties"", so now his tiger is tig bitties. my wife thinks it was completely inappropriate, i think it was a silly joke that went over his head and will have no negative ramifications.",3
"for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?. dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but i'm struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

we've always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. this year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and i jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. we learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, i adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

none of this has been a problem for me until recently. she saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then i rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. she exploded in anger (teen years, i'm not too fussed about the anger explosion, i know she doesn't mean it) and said that that was her pan for vegan food. i was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it's not your pan. 

she asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. i didn't want her to feel weird about food, so i said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. the reason they're colored is so it helps me remember that i'm not to touch them unless i'm cooking vegan. 

that wasn't good enough. now apparently the dishwasher is 'contaminated' with animal product, and the fridge has 'bacon grease fingers' on it (because i eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she's asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. i don't mean i literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because i wash my hands, but it's clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly i'm on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. my wife's reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn't want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. my daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it's specifically meat products that make her feel sick. now i'm sorry for her, but i feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because i'm not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",3
"aita for wearing the ""joke"" bikini my friend got me?. so it was my birthday couple months ago. had a party. got some gifts. my friend ""mandy"" for me a ""super cute bikini"". i liked it. said thanks. she had ripped the tags off but whatever. 

anyway. went to the community pool with my roommate. wore bikini. got in the water. roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... i look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. 

haha good joke mandy. 

anyway, mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. most leave and we're still hanging out. i'm like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? i go change after them. and meet her bf in the hot tub she's getting new drinks. i hop in. immediately, he's looking at my chest. i pretend i don't notice and just make small talk. she comes out a few min after. and just looks in shock. eventually gets in. ""uhh is that the one i bought?"" yeah i love it. i wear it everywhere. make up some stuff about how i wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she's just like ""oh"". 

we're in the tub for 20-30. eventually get out and change. she approached me after and was like. ""uhm i'm sorry thought you'd notice. but it goes kinda see thru"". i'm like yeah i know why'd you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? ""she's like it's a joke. wait you knew? so you just spent last 30' flashing my bf on purpose?"" i reply i'm just wearing my birthday gift from her. 


anyway. aita?",3
"for despising my mentally handicap sister?. the title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200b;

my sister is severely autistic. she requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. she is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200b;

i hate her. that should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200b;

i was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. even since i can remember the world has revolved around her. i was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. all of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when i complained. even when i was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me i was in the wrong.

&#x200b;

along with this i am expected to take care of her and drop everything i do for her. i can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. even when i do somehow get time to myself i am required to leave if they need me. if i do not then i am punished. the recent example of this is when i went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200b;

it seems as if i am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. this last week i was chosen to give a speech at a school event. i was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200b;

i've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. while talking about colleges with my father, he joked that i should get a degree that pays well so when their gone i can take care of my sister. i don't know why but this caused me to break down. i cried and screamed about how it always about her. i'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that i'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&#x200b;

i've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. am i the asshole here?

&#x200b;

edit/update kinda:

wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. i never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. thank you all. after thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that i don't despise my sister. it's not her fault that she was born the way she is. my parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but i was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. they have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. my parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best i leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. thank you all again for the love and support through this <3

"for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?. so my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. she was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. she was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn't lift a finger to go visit her. 

i tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. he said no. and my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. i spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he'd have to fly over to her country too. which is fair enough. 

he said no, he didn't want to fly or travel anywhere. my son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

last week, he told us she's dumped him. i went on her fb page as we're all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she's upset it didn't work out but these things happen, so we're on good terms) and looks like she's with a new guy already. me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

i confessed to them both that i actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. he did not treat her properly and i hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. i said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

wife and son are very upset that i said this. very very upset and my wife says i am being horrible.

"for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?. new to reddit, please bare with. 

so i (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

however, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. she and i have quite a lot in common, and i actually like spending time with her. however it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; i'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. however, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if i want coffee. i sleep naked. every time prior to the last one, i've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. i always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but i didn't"". 

when she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, i intentionally slept on top of the covers. sure enough, she barges in at 7am, begins to ask if i want coffee and sees my you-know-what. she immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. my mate later pulled me aside and said i was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that i'd ""threatened"" to do it before (i literally just said ""okay but what if i had no covers and you saw everything"" before). they're now framing this to others that i'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how i get my rocks off, and i'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. for doing this?",3
"for giving my ex wife a large amount of money i won despite the anger of my gf?. i recently won a 'fuck you' amount of money. i won't say exactly how much but it's in the millions. it makes me feel funny even typing it's enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

my ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. she is an amazing woman and good to the bone. we divorced 6 years ago because i had an affair with my current partner. i was in a low place in my life and i fucked up. she was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that i know she was hurting. she still is close with my parents. she is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

she was actually the first person i phoned after my mom and pops after i found out i won the lottery. she was pleased for me, joked that i could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. nothing else. as soon as i won, i knew i wanted to give her a significant amount. i still love her. she's the mother of my babies and i feel like this is some small tiny way i can show her that i'm not a complete fuck up. she deserves to know that i care despite my mistakes. she also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. give our kids a better life between us. i haven't discussed this with my ex yet, but i have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

long story short, when i told my gf, she was my livid. screaming that i'm disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- i'm not *in* love with her. we've both grown apart, but of course i still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. my gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh i'm feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. i don't plan on changing my plans, but aita?

"for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?. ok this is the worst. i'm losing sleep over this.

i'm getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and i cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

my brother is gay, but my family doesn't know, only me and my parents know. i come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century's mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

so my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, i'm so happy my brother found a great guy. but it's kind of a secret, as he hasn't told my family he is gay.

i've been telling him for years that he should come out, cause i know it stresses him a lot, and i think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus i bet a few family members already know anyway.

but he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won't accept it and it will be a lot of drama. i see the opposite, i see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. i have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn't accept my brother being gay.

anyway, that's his decision not mine, so for now he won't say anything.

until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. i was not expecting that to be honest. so he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

if it was any other occasion i would be supportive obviously, but i don't think my wedding day is the day to do that.  imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. and i don't want to get the attention away from my fiancee, that's her day. and i dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and i think it's a pretty good reason

i asked him why my wedding day, he said it's because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. this is killing me. i would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if i had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and i can't do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

i didn't even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

with a heavy heart, i asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that i hope he understands me. he  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

next day i got a text and he said "" dont worry, going alone"". i tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don't seem to know what's happening because they didn't say anything.

he eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

this is the worst situation of my life, am i the asshole for handling it the way i did?

ps 1: i wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

ps 2: thanks for the gold and stuff!

update: spoke to fiancee, couldn't keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

clarification: i know it won't be my brother that would cause trouble. the trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. doesn't matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.i don't want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. literally every other day of my life i will support my brother's decision to come out. even at the wedding, i would obviously defend him. but the point is, not at the wedding. also, my brother is not the asshole. not at all.",3
"for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?. i (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. my boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. he gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. i'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

however, there's one girl in our class, let's call her victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. she goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. i know this is the case, because i've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

i've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and i don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. however, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. i rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. she was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him i was there too.

victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. i snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. you're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

she looked super embarrassed and walked away, and i later heard she'd gone home crying. i feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. aita?

edit: she 100% knows that i am his girlfriend, i have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",3
"so we decided to fuck with the sub.. # major update: 60 minute contest mode & extension of beta testing to august 14. 

**we have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. the beta test will be extended to august 14.** it has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. we ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. please see below for some comparative information!

**we noticed massive increases in time until top comment**

> before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. 

> with the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (around 30-40% increase)

> with the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). this is an incredible increase and very rare for reddit as a whole. we're taking this as a win. (around 120-150% increase)

> unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. however, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to google).**

> we don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. however, we know it was much shorter. i think it was somewhere around half?

> this shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). 


**more information to be seen! we will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**

# original thread info

hey all you assholes and judges. we recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. a huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. take a look here(https://m.imgur.com/a/vzvv1ag). 

we think that's a problem. a comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. we want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. so, we've decided to fuck with the sub. 

---

# introducing ~~30-minute~~ 60-minute contest mode

for the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **contest mode.** the comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. you will not be able to see the karma score of comments. after 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. the comment order will be ""best"" instead. 

**why did we do this?** the first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. by opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. no one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. we tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). it didn't work out well. a 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",3
"for keeping my website up after being asked to remove it?. **updated 7:50 pm:** holy crap! thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. i never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! i had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when i checked back in after work. several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.

&#x200b;

my intent was to answer more questions since i wasn't able to do that while at work. i was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however i've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what i have already posted if i wish to pursue a civil suit.

&#x200b;

just a couple things i want to address in my update here. some people are saying i'm leaving out details. my original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. i had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so i apologize if it looks like details have been left out. i did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. lastly, my son is now back with me. there was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.

&#x200b;

i'm sorry if i didn't respond to your comment or private message. i'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. i can't even begin to put into words how grateful i am. again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.

back in november 2018 i was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. it was the most humiliating thing i've ever experienced. i later learned at the police station that i was being charged with multiple felonies. this came as a huge surprise. luckily i was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. for $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, i was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. however it cost me everything and i was unable to pay my bond. this resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. at a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and i ended up having all my charges dismissed. when i finally got out i learned that i had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. his mother is a heroine addict and i haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. they wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200b;

since my release, i've learned that i can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that i was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. i've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. they took down my info but never followed up. so what i did was create a website sharing my story. i also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. literally the only reason why i was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. if the detective had done his job, he could have verified that i wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. this is what pisses me off the most. my life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200b;

i'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. i live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. my web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. i received a cease and desist letter recently, which i showed to my attorney. he said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything i had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. yesterday i received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. he apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" they then talked to me about my website and asked if i could remove it. i said i would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200b;

after the visit i received, i'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. i don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. my friends think i'm being spiteful and have suggested that i just delete it. for keeping my website up?

"for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?. **edit: the boyfriend doesnt live with us and doesnt pay rent or bills. him and his daughtes spend time here and pay only for their food: something i do as well*** 

my dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she's started seeing. i'm 23m and going into my final year of college. my moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. my mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone's favourite uncle. and while i'm glad everyone else is comfortable, i'm not. 

he isn't a bad guy, i'm just still grieving my father, and it feels like he's trying to replace him. he tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn't because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. boyfriend thinks it's only fair because i have siblings now. i think it's ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

he's trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. they aren't lacking for anything but he thinks it's only fair because ~family~. 

i live in the basement of my moms house. i have since i was 15. when you come in the front door there's a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. so it's pretty separate. 

so last night i was dding for some friends and got home at 2 am. i had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren't until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. so this has never been a big deal with my parents. i shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. i got a lecture and sent to my room and ""possible loss of car privileges.""

i snapped and laid it out for him. i told him i'm leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i'm glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. i told him our relationship won't be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won't want to have a relationship with him. 

he told my family and they think i'm the asshole. aita?",3
"update: for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last?. this is the original post: /r/amitheasshole/comments/dcvwmo/aita_for_continuing_to_call_my_teacher_by_her/

i first want to thank everybody who commented on my post. it honestly helped me so much and without it i don't know if i'd end up in this position.

so i went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. they of course said no. i'm kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he'd come to me if it meant so much. however he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn't work he'd definitely accompany me to the principals office.

so i went to my teacher. i already knew how everything was going to go out so i didn't have any hope. i told her that i don't appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues i would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the mrs.). she told me that i was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. i told her that many people don't think she's fair and in return she just looked confused. i handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she's my english teacher). her face went from nothing to just sadness. i swear it was so weird. it's like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.

she apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. and saying my name just gets her bad memories i guess? she told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. at this point i kinda felt guilty because i never took this thought into consideration.

she told me she'd try to say my name ( and won't cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime i can still call her by her first name. ( all my classmates are jealous because i'm the only person allowed lol)

we've talked about the past detentions she's given me and she said she'll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.

honestly this isn't how i thought things were going to turn out. and i'm pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",3
"for telling cashier that wasn't the girls credit card?. 
throwaway because husband told me i was ta and want to know before i get home and argue. on phone format is bad.

i was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. one of the girls had picked out a pair of very expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she's really gonna spend that much on boots. girl with boots says something along the lines of ""it's fine i have my dads credit card i'm not paying "" which instantly caught my attention because thats not her card. i've told my son multiple times he's never allowed to use my card so i'm interested to see how this girl thinks she's going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

we end up at the same register (me behind) and i see her total hit well over four digits. the girl is about to swipe her card when i decide that i can't let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. i tell cashier that isn't her card but her father's and i'm not sure she has permission. girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look i've ever seen. i swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, i don't think she was ever told no.

girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it's the stores credit card and it gives him the points. now that i've pointed out it wasn't hers cashier tells her she can't use that card. girl tries to show id to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and i tell her it's still fraud. girl says it's not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. i tell her that it is my business that she's doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or i call the cops. girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. she uses her own card and leaves crying. cashier looks mad at me and i tell my husband when i get home only for him to agree i was in the wrong.

"for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?. i am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. both of them had spouses at the time. my birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when i was conceived so there was no way i was his. a few months after i was born they decided not to divorce. i was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that i am adopted by my grandparents. recently i decided that i wanted to know more about my dad's family and i sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so i could get to know him. well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over skype. they both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

well i did pretty much the opposite. i contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. she is now divorcing him while on my mother's side i told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother.

we called him into a meeting on friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. i thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

i told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.

"hey assholes, you're doing it wrong.. since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time i ranted about voting on this sub. so, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: welcome to the sub! second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.

you may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:

* **upvote real dilemmas**. if you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the op is an asshole or not, **upvote it**, because that's an interesting post!!
* **upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. if you see a post where you think the op is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **upvote it** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!
* **stop rewarding validation posts**. upvotes are not a political statement. they aren't something you give because the op is really nice. every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the op is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the op, they're ruining the sub. if you want to tell op they're great, write an nta comment and praise them all you want. don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.

as you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. what makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. this is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. please be the better person and vote correctly here. interesting content depends on it!  (if you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)

also important: in the comments, show a little backbone. **don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** if you say the post is nta, and someone else says it's esh, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. if you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. there are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. the whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. if you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and gtfo. you have come to the wrong place.

p.s. if you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. maybe you're not an asshole after all.  


edit:  i see a lot of people in this discussion suggesting rules we already have in place.  i suggest you read the full rule book and the faq if you think you've got a new idea.

"for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?. background: i graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. my sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. we both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. i pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

this is a throwaway and it's still fresh and i'm really emotionally charged right now. last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. i overheard and i offered to help by paying more in rent (i was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. my parents were grateful. now, prior to this, i never asked my how much sister pays in rent. i always figured my parents charged us the same. so absentmindedly i asked a follow-up question.

me: how much is my sister paying for rent?

my mom: nothing.

a long ass pause.

me: what do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

my dad (visibly angry): your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

my dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. she doesn't pay rent. she doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. so for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while i've been paying my parents.

so later that night we had a family sit down talk. my sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much i was paying. she offered $100. my parents suggested she pay $300, i pay $800 which my sister and i both rejected.

the conversation ended with this:

sister: **fuck you. i'm trying to live my life.** these were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

so my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. i'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. my mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

so i say my part before leaving.

me: i'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (it's only fair right?) and if i do pay rent, i pay whatever she's being.

my mom: what if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

me: no.

my mom: but me, we really need the money...

me: that's too bad.

i get up and go off to my room.

so this morning my dad comes in tells me that i'm an asshole for not paying rent. that i should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. i'm like, ""what the hell? make my sister pay rent!""

my mom, who's listening in.

""you've seen her! she won't listen to us!""

me: well that's too bad.

my mom (really angry): well we wouldn't have this problem if you didn't try to make your sister pay rent.

that was the last straw that blew it for me. i slammed the door on my parents.

as i'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. like wtf?",3
"for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it?. i fucking hate wedding culture.

it's bullshit.

my fiance and i thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. we were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

then the demands started coming out. they wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person has to be a groomsman, etc etc. suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

we put our foot down and said:

>thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. when we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. with so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   
>  
>our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  
>  
>if you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. but if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.

this has caused an epic shitstorm. such to the point where i have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. my parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. 

we are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want.

"if i ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?. my wife is pregnant with our daughter. initially we were really happy and excited about it. but then, she starts acting like a nut job. she gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food i make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

for example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. well, i made chicken sandwiches. so she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. i wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. but if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? when i asked her this she told me that she was hungry. ok fine. she does this every time. eats everything i make and calls it shit. i don't argue with her because i work for more than 80 hours a week and i really want to have some peace when i'm home.

so, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if i wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. i rejected her and told her that i was married. and when i got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. when i asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. so they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. and i passed. yay!!. i'm really pissed. i'm done with her antics. if i ask her to move out?

"for purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?. this issue is honestly making me frustrated. almost everyone is saying i am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and i genuinely don't know if what i did was correct or not. i just feel so lost. please, please do help.

i am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when i was 13. i have 2 really deep,long facial scars. i have been bullied really bad because of it. i am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. people make fun of other people by saying things like ""why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" i am honestly used to it. those people didn't matter to me anyway.

but there is this girl i had known since middle school. let's call her back i guess? sorry, i honestly don't know how this works. i had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. i thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. my family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. i can play a guitar so i made this whole song for her. i went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. this was the first time i felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and i felt that regardless of what i do, she shall see me for who i am and at least accept me as a friend.

i was over the moon when she ended up accepting. we went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. she was really sweet to me. the next week or so was honestly heaven. people started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, i honestly cried everyday because i felt so fortunate to get so much love.
it all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on instagram and followed beck, sent screenshots to me. i honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

she had posts saying 'fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his valentine's"", 'making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of march, and then distance themselves from me. she apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.and thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since i was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

i was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. my blood was boiling. i researched about this award, found a facebook page about it online.i went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

she is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. i am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly i have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


edit: i am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. each comment means the world to me. i am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. no one besides my family has said these things to me. i know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. from the bottom of my heart,thank you.

edit 2: honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. i promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. thank you for the gold.thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. i honestly have gone through as many as i can and i just feel really fortunate and grateful.

i sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

edit 3: i am sorry for boring you with all these edits. i geniunely can't thank you guys enough. i showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. i am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

but, i have been noticing a worrying number of dms saying me i could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

i am not this kind of person and i hope nobody is. i have my own integrity. it's not right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. a couple of other dms sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. it's honestly horrifying. i am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. i just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

i thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. a lot of women are amazing. my mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and i am sure many women out there are amazing.  please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. because i am not going to do that, ever. please don't say all women are manipulative etc. 

this post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person i believe wronged me.",3
"because i refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she's very sick? i low key hate her.. i'm 15 years old. i have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. i'm not sure what's wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she's non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. she also doesn't understand stuff. that's probably the easiest way to put it. she's just a human body with nothing inside. 

she's my stepmoms daughter. my stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. i don't know my stepmom very well and i don't really get on with her. we are respectful to each other but i'm basically living with strangers because she's so busy with her daughter and my dad. i am always on my own and i used to hate it but i'm used to it now.

ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. that's fine, i get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that i don't want to do and i resent doing. stuff like staying home when i want to go to the mall with my friends, they're disappointed that i don't get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

my own mom passed away when i was small so i can't go and stay anywhere else and all in all i'm just a lot more angry than i used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever i say i don't want to do anything for her. even stuff like feeding her- like- i don't want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. i didn't ask for this. 

anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. she was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. i don't want to go and visit her. i remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and i just hate hospitals and i sort of hate my stepsister and i just don't want to go and visit someone who doesn't even know i'm there. 

my stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. they haven't yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because i don't want to visit. my grandma who lives in canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and i don't need to force myself to go to the hospital so i'm assuming my dad has told her i'm refusing to go. he keeps pleading with me but i keep telling him i'm not doing it. i told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and i need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.

"for calling my co-worker ""chunky"" after she repeatedly calls me ""slim"" and makes references to my weight after i asked her multiple times not to.. i have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. i'm female 5'9"" 115lbs and very thin. she is very overweight. all the time she makes comments about my weight. she doesn't call me by name she calls me ""slim"" and i even heard her say one time ""go ask toothpick"" and she has said stuff like ""you need some meat on your bones"" & ""you need to eat"". i have only worked there 8 days. i have asked her very nicely to stop. yesterday i asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. 

today when she said ""morning slim"" i replied ""morning chunky"" and she got upset and actually started crying. everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying i'm wrong and i should apologize because being called fat is ""different"" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a ""compliment"". i said as long as she calls me slim, i will call her chunky and now i'm the bad person. if i don't apologize? the owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's ""a high school issue and we should figure it out"".

edit for more info: we don't have hr. there's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). we are all regular employees. i went to the owner before i called her chunky and i asked him to talk to her because i felt she was harassing me. that's when he said we can handle it ourselves. that's why i called her chunky. i told her to stop calling me slim and i didn't like it and she continued to do it. she didn't stop doing it after i asked multiple times and i didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. she brought up my weight, i brought up her's.",3

""hi starving, i'm not your daughter"". she had this biggest smirk on her face. she hugged me and i kissed her forehead. i'm sure she'd been planning this for weeks.

"for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?. i have 3 kids, 15f, 12f and 7m. my oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because i am too. recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. it was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

after the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. there was a fair bit of wine involved (i was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my fil let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate i still cuddled with my 15yo. i don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but i was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. to my surprise, my wife and mil both agreed with him.

i have a lot of respect for my in-laws, i get along with them great and i consider them closer than my own parents. obviously i'm quite fond of my wife as well, but i outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. i've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. they all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. aita?

"for not telling my wife that i picked her daughter up drunk from a house party?. i'm going to try to keep this short and simple. i always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they need to get out of, just call me and i'll drop whatever i'm doing and i will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. i let them know that i used to be a teenager once before, i told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. we're only human and it's a part of life.

last weekend i got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. she was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.

i got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. i had to pick her up and carry her to the car. i told her i was disappointed that she snuck out, but i also told her i was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

"for pointing out to my friends that they are not famous?. my friends are dating, they're also actors who have had small roles on a few tv shows (i'm talking two lines or less). i say this not to be a hater, i truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they've got under 1500 followers combined). 

anyway last week i posted a group picture on instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other's shoulders. very platonic. 

anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don't want ""the public"" to know they are dating. i would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don't. also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. 

anyway i asked what they meant, and they said they didn't want to end up in gossip rags....

i pointed out that they are not famous and that they don't even have functioning imdb pages. they were livid and called me a bunch of names. 

i think they're delusional but they've been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). at this point, i don't even want to be their friend. however, and probably because i'm an asshole, i don't want to delete it based solely on principle.

edit: okay, so many of y'all are right. i suppose i should separate how i feel about their (ridiculous/delusional/stupid) reasoning with the fact that no one should have an image of themselves online that they don't want made public. i'll take it down.",3

"for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?. hi all. 

i gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter charlotte. 

my cousin alice and her parents were among the guests. the first thing i'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. she's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. she doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. she is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

it was alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly charlotte vomited on her. alice handed charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. i went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. my mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

today i got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

i have said no. at the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. she took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. i feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

"update: for shutting down all black names because i think it'll make my son's life harder?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/

i posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and i were having with our baby's name. we had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. my husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black american culture. i wanted a more neutral name since i am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. we found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. his name will be....

miles trayvon

we thought it was a perfect compromise. my husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be ""tray"" to most of them. when he's in school his name will just be listed as miles (last name). he can officially be miles t. (last name) if he doesn't want to use trayvon but he can also easily go by trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. this option gives him the choice, which my husband and i agreed was important. my husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. he talked about how in 8 mile eminem's character says something like, ""this guy's a gangsta? his real name is clarence."" that's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. he's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.

i had the opposite experience. my mom is white and my dad is black. they decided on a stereotypical black name and i think it made my life harder. professional i go by a nickname and i do personally as well. when talking about it with my husband i realized it started early. i remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. a woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma i was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. instead of saying my real name my grandma said, ""her name is daisy."" i attended an hbcu and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. for example, raquan smith would put ""ray smith"", demarcus jones would put ""marcus jones"", keshawnda nelson would put ""shawna nelson"", etc. they said you had to play within the system and i did that.

anyway, sorry for the long update. i just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. we didn't really get deep into it until after i posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. before anyone says it, i do realize some people will connect trayvon to trayvon martin. that's not why we are using it. i posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but i don't mean to offend anyone. it's a family name on my husband's side.

edit: thanks for all the dms but please stop sending me articles about the woman named marijuana pepsi and the black spider-man named miles. thanks y'all.",3
"for ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name?. i've worked at my office for 8 years. i'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. i'm not his supervisor, but i'm definitely a senior employee. i'll call the guy ted faro, because he's a dick.

​

supervisor was going around introducing ted to people, and when he got to me said ""this is john"" and described my job.

​

ted: ""hi, jack.""

me: ""it's john.""

​
ted: ""what?""
​

me: ""my name's john, not jack.""

ted: ""it's close enough for me.""

supervisor: ""his name's john, not jack. let's move on.""

​

this continued for a few months. despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when i wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name jack. i finally told him ""you either use my name, or i ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

his response was ""sure thing, jackie boy.""

​

since i don't work directly with him, i figured ""screw it"" and that i'd ignore him.

​

recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. i work late some nights, and ted came to me and says ""hey, jack, i'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when i get back. see you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

as promised, i ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and i get a call. i recognize his number, so i ignored it. he called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

the first one was along the lines of ""jack i'm at enterprise. come pick me up.""

e-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as jack, jack-o, jackie, and jackie-boy. the emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

i signed out and went home. it was raining hard.

next morning, i saw that ted had sent a few more e-mails. i printed them off. at 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""where the f-bomb were you? i told you when to pick me up! i had to take a cab! do you know how much that cost me?!"" he goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

supervisor: ""ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. he was caught out in the rain.""

​

i relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. i'd highlighted the threats.

supervisor: ""i can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. but it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. that's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""with the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

​

a few people at the office have commented that i'm the jerk for ignoring ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

okay. i'm the type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. so i waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, i honk. she then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which i already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. each time she makes an attempt to order something i honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. we stopped as soon as she drove off. we then ordered and went about our day.

"for pretending to be an ""appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me?. i got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

i told them them all that i had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. when i first told them they thought i was joking, but they underestimated how committed i would be to a joke. so, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) i was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

finally after about a week they bought that i had become an appletarian. they started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. some of them even got angry.

but i wanted to stick with the joke. finally, after the end of 3 weeks, i walked into what i was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

they were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. finally i started laughing hysterically. they were confused as hell so i told them i had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. i even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

i thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. my girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago i had ruined our date night when i told the waiter i only wanted apples because i was an appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

in my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

but, did i go too far?

"update:for objecting to 'girls day'?. hello,

this is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/

this last month has been kind of wild for me so i haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. so the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. due to the fact that i had deactivated my facebook and was only receiving text messages, i didn't realize what was happening before i was ambushed by it. my sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and i confirmed that it was. and she insisted i was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. i responded that i in no way did that as i was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. 

this spread to my family and now the thread was shared on facebook and everyone was shown. i was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where i was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what i did was wrong and demanded an apology. they said that 'i knew' they weren't excluding me and because i gave everyone that impression i owed them an apology. i replied that i absolutely did not know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. i replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-op event, not a girls only event.  they explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether i was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because i'm not a girl. at this point we were going around in circles so i just explained my perspective, i said that i'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it i feel excluded. i explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation i was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. 

at the end of this family meeting, i was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and i was accused of many things that i didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. i told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that i was going no contact for a while. i told them i'm an adult, and i have my own life, and the reason i wanted to be involved was because i didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. if that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but i told them that i was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. my mother/sisters told me that if i was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. at this point, my relationship with my family is over, i left that family meeting and have not reactivated facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. que sera, sera.

"for wanting my daughter's boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage?. i'm the dad of a 25 year old young woman who i love very much. i've been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and i enjoy my time with her, but there's one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

she exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, i realized she needed professional help. throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. with an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. she received an aspd diagnosis at 18, and i had suspected it for long prior.

after her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. she's law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. she uses that old dating guide ""the rules"" like a bible. she currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who's crazy about her, and who i have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). he is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

but i doubt she loves him. we've had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she's been open with me that she doesn't feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. when she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt ""pretty neutral"" about the whole thing. she has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she's ever done, and doesn't know what guilt feels like. while she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, i highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she's been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it'll scare him away. i've made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or i will**; to which she always responds, ""i know you wouldn't dare."" i actually would - i really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this ""secret"" from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

i'm not trying to sabotage my daughter's future. **maybe** her boyfriend's love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won't end the relationship. it's his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. someday he's bound to find out she's a bit ""off""; it can't be kept a secret forever. aita?",3
"for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner. ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. she would make noises in between conversations like ""bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. this is especially embarrassing when i am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


i have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. i have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


it was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. we went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""


seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. i rolled my eyes and told her:


""i am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. please excuse me."" 


then i left the restaurant without her. i don't know what occurred to me but i probably shouldn't have done that, but i guess it kinda just snapped. aita?",3
"for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her african american boyfriend to her grandparents?. let me just preface this by saying this: **i have absolutely no problem with interracial relationships.** now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

my daughter (anna) has recently started to date an african american man (jamal). while i'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, i'm happy. the problem is anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. while her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. as i said, i have no problem with mixed relationships and i've set them straight, but i am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

my parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and anna expressed a desire to introduce jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. i told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. i may have no problem with jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. they might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. anna was extremely upset by this and implied i was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

as i said, i know my parents. they simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if anna were to bring jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

anna is currently staying with jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. my wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when i introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend i confided in told me that i have behaved like an ass and that i needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

no advice needed, but i have to know. have i been an ass?",3
"for going to the police over a 'prank'. throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

to preface this, i (24f) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. i have not eaten meat since i was roughly 3-4 years old when i found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). this is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so i thought. 


four nights ago, i was at a party and i will admit, i got white girl wasted. my friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. i checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" to which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). they tasted off to me but i figured it was just because i was drunk. i was wrong. 

i found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends snapchat story. the story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where i asked if it was vegan). the and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when i found out i ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the chickens!!!""). i took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

they all think that i'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so reddit, aita? in my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. in their view, it was just a prank.",3
"for i telling my childhood bully (who is mtf transgender) that she will always be the ""boy who bullied me""?. when i was a in middle school, i was viciously bullied by this boy, who i'll call z. he spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. 

it's been 12 years, and z has since come out as mtf transgender. she messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. we went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. it was along the lines of, ""i'm sorry for being mean. i was young, and i was struggling with my gender identity.""

i thanked her for her apology. when she asked if she was forgiven, and i tried to avoid answering. i am still not over what she did to me. what z did to me impacted me greatly, as i was a impressionable young girl. i struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

z started getting defensive. she told me that i was being petty and that i should forgive her. i told her, ""why? you will always be the boy that bullied me.  an apology won't change that."" she got really offended when i said the word boy, and said that i was misgendering her. she called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out.

"because i ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?. what i thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and i'm up at 7:05 am dealing with it. i figured while i wait for a text, i could post here to see if what i did was really that bad. 

i'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. i love to eat which probably borders on addiction but i figure since i'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. i have some great friends although there is no doubt i'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. i guess that sets the stage enough. 

last night my friend hosted ufc and i was invited. he got a 6 foot party sub. i also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. well of course people flocked to the food and i had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and i didn't get to have a single one. which is totally fine that's why i brought them but maybe an hour later i was starving. i kept eyeing the sandwich and i'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. i waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). so i was like screw it...i took about half of what was left and ate it. then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

well to be sure as i was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. like i was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. i guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. she was furious and said that i was an incredible pig and that i had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. i felt so bad i tried to explain to her that i really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. i also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

i offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. i said i was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

i woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that i had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that i embarrassed myself last night. i tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

was i the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

edit: i guess i've been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so i can't find out why.

to answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn't a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. this is a local place so it's about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. its still a ton of food don't get me wrong but i can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",3
"for getting upset that my sister's fiance pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?. the title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

i'm 24 and i'm an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

i used and used until i was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

she's my best friend and i know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

she also met her fiance two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. he's not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much i put my sister through. 

despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because i am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

when i get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

when i walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure i ""didn't bring anything in"".  i instinctively pull away, because why wouldn't i, and i tell him not to touch me. 

he tells me to ""calm down"" and that if i want to be here then he needs to do this. i tell him he's being ridiculous and i try to push past him. he stops me and tells me that he doesn't want to throw me out but he ""will if he has to."" i told him that he's trying to look tough but it's just making him look stupid. 

at this point i'm getting more and more angry and i'm practically yelling in his face at this point. bystanders came between us and separated us and told my bil to just ""drop it."" he said he would but that ""they can deal with it when i get out of hand.""

i just went to go find a seat after that. 

after the reception, a lot of my family told me that i should've let him just do it and that i was acting like a huge asshole and like i had ""something to hide."" 

i don't think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and i don't think my reaction was over the top. if anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. my sister has refused to take any sides in this.

"if i called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?. my son was born when i was only 15 years old, and i've been a single dad since i was 18. it was hard living for a long time money-wise but i always tried to do best by my son. today i own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. he came out to me when he was 14 years old and i've always been supportive of him and his identity. 

i've been with my fiance now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. my son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and i've gotten to know him really well. however my fiance told me recently that she does not want my son's boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. that if they found out, they would have a complete fit. this really bothered me because i refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. what is going to happen in the future? when my son gets married himself? will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? he's my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. when i told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that i was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. i told her that this was unacceptable and that i was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. it's my wedding too and i was his boyfriend there. 

after that i got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn't been discussed again. however, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. i do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. i love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. i told my brother and he said that i was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it's unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his ""step grandparents"" in the future anyway. i still don't feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. would i be the asshole if i did this? am i being unreasonable here?",3
"for outing my ex as gay after she told everyone that i cheated on her?. i know the title sounds absolutely terrible. 
 
my ex and i were together for 5 years. i decided to propose, but she rejected me. the next day, we had a talk. she realized that she was gay, since ""i've been trying to hard to please myself from men"". we broke up.

"for choosing my brother over my marriage?. my parents divorced when i was 3, and went into separate marriages. i had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. when i was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. i had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.

five years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. my mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. my father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. obviously my family is morning, and i've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.

the only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and i'm not going to let that happen. i told my wife that i was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. she did not take it well and is furious that i would choose my brother over her. i doubt my marriage will survive, but i can't let my brother go into foster care.

"for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiance that i cheated 9 years ago?. for reference, my brother connor is 19, i am 26, and my (now ex) fiance hunter is 28. also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. hunter and i were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when connor asked if we wanted to join them. i initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and hunter thought it'd be fun to act like college students again.

we all got pretty drunk and connor had the idea of playing never have i ever. a few rounds in, the statement ""never have i ever cheated before"" came up.

now's a good time to mention that hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. his ex-fiance cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. and unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, i cheated on my ""boyfriend"" of 5 months. it was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. this was almost a decade ago, i obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

well my brother knows about this so when i didn't drink, he went ""hey sis, what the hell? you know you cheated on (*insert ex's name*). you have to drink to that!""

my boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. i followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn't haven't any of it and ended things on the spot. i'm numb. i'm heartbroken. he was my everything and more and i still don't know how i'm going to move on.

connor tried to apologize, but i feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. this morning i served him an eviction notice. he begged me to stay and said he didn't mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn't think when he said those words. i just can't look at him right now. he ruined my life. after i raised him and cared for him like he was my own. i feel so hurt. am i being unreasonable?",3
"for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?. train is packed, it's hot, i'm tired and looking for a place to sit. everything was occupied, but at one point i see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. i went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. i asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. i noticed she had headphones in, so i figured i'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as i'm sitting down.

as soon as i touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck i was doing. i explained. she then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. i told her i knew for a fact she was alone because i just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. so i started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

this released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. i saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so i figured i'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""oh i'm sorry, i didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. my bad, i'll get up now"". i got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as i was walking away.

"for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.. i have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that i hang out with almost every day. we've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, john. 

i never really liked john. he was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. he was also incredibly pretentious. a friend of mine said ""einstein"" once and john interrupted him to say, ""i have no idea who you are talking about. do you mean the reknown scientist albert einshtein?"". i once put up a snapchat story saying, ""i love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""it's called gridiron you moron"".  i don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

on one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. john was kind of tipsy. we had some new girls show up so i was kinda working my charm on them. they asked me what i did and i went ""i'm a biomed engineer"". i don't know why that triggered john so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how i'm just a drone in a rat race. he kept telling me about how i'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. he later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

every time i mention work or anything, john would start roasting me. he nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though i expressed multiple times that i dont like to be called a drone. he would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what i do. that really pissed me off. once i told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""what are you going to do, fight me? i dare you to swing"". i didn't want to fight him so now i started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

over the last few months or so i kinda went frontpage a couple of times on reddit and everyone was like, ""damn m0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). that triggered him even more. he'd say stuff like ""his posts suck. they're not even funny. reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


at this point it is relevant to bring up what john does. he's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at starbucks. how good is he? honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a dslr, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. i'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an instagram post about how national georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. at the party, i apologized to him (i hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""i'm sorry you didn't get nat geo"". to which he got angry again and said, ""i'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. what i'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so i actually feel sorry for you"". he said stuff like this in front of a girl i was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

that's it. i fucking lost it. we were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with john and i took that opportunity to say, ""well john, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder nat geo rejected you. you're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iphone camera. you're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *i get cut off here*"" 

his dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. john came charging at me but everyone just held him back. the rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and i got kicked out. no one has talked to me since the incident and john blocked me from all social media. our group chat has been pretty silent too. john also apparently made a roast post about me. idk if i should apologize to him or not. sorry for the long post. i know john is an asshole, but aita?

"for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?. i work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

i told them ""you might want to cut that out! llamas spit in self-defense."" but they kind of laughed my warning off.

now, i knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. but i decided not to tell them about that. i figured if they persisted, i'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

the llama was being patient. at one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. it got the girl square in the face. she dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that i was in.

to make things worse for them, i didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! it was a slow day, so i just locked the doors. i told them i didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

aita? the girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. maybe it was...i knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but i wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",3
"aita for giving a woman a taste of her own behavior. i'm sitting at the airport and this older lady sat down right next to me and took her ipad out and starts watching a show quite loud. 

to me this is a foul in public however i just ignored it and put my earbuds in. 

after a while i made a phone call using my earbuds. literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.

i was as polite as i could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and i could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. 

she said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. 

i said she was absolutely right and i am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and i will do  the same.       i then proceeded to take out my ipad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. 

i have never seen someone storm off so mad.

"for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?. when my daughter was 14, wife and i decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. there would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. the stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

we made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. we got the car, a 2012 honda civic. she has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. in a few months she will be off to college. everything was going swimmingly. until someone on that nextdoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. and lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. i was livid. my wife was the one who showed it to me. we found out there were more instances (from her instagram stories) and we decided... no.

wife and i up and sold the car. we didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. it's so unfair, i didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am i supposed to get to work, what about when i go to college? well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. she tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and i said ""well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

this has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. they've threatened that they will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

the car is already sold, so there's no going back. i think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. in terms of her going to college? well, she made that choice. she had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

"for spraying the neighborhood kids with my garden hose?. i love strawberries. i love them so much that i planted 300 strawberry plants in my garden. after i harvest, i make lots of strawberry jelly to give to my family, friends, and neighbors. i donate the leftovers to my local food bank.

lately i've had a big problem with all the neighborhood kids coming in my yard and stealing my strawberries. the last time i caught them i threatened them with the police because they was so reckless they smashed over 50 of my plants.

i caught them in my yard again this afternoon, instead of calling the police i grabbed my garden hose and sprayed them while chasing them out of my yard. 

i just had a group of angry parents come to my house complaining about my actions. absolutely none of them was willing to apologize for their children's actions. one parent in particular is threatening to sue me, because her son's iphone 10 was ruined with water. i told her that was her problem for letting her eight-year-old son have a $1,000 phone. then i threatened to spray them with my hose if they didn't get off of my property.",3
"for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that i helped get addicted to drugs?. i'm 26 and clean from heroin for 3 years. 

i was also a piece of shit and used to deal for a while. 

i managed to get with a beautiful girl named marcy when i first started getting into the thick of things. she knew who i was but she said she loved me. 

i will regret this for the rest of my life, but i was the person who shot up marcy for the first time. after that, there was no stopping her. she stuck around with me, probably because i was her dealer more than anything, but then i got clean and never saw her again for a long time. 

a year ago she reached out to me on facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn't hate me for what happened and she hoped i was still clean. 

last week i got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on facebook that marcy had od'd and there was a funeral service this upcoming thursday.

i immediately just burst into tears because i hoped that this would never happen and i feel so much guilt over it. 

i want to go to the funeral service for her but i'm afraid that my presence would be unwanted. at the most i would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave. i need to do this for myself.

"for starting my wedding on time and not waiting for my parents?. i got married on saturday, and it was absolutely amazing except for one thing: my parents showed up late. they knew the ceremony time, and my husband and i made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time. the venue cost us a lot of money (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count. 

so the wedding day came, and half an hour before we were scheduled to start, my parents still hadn't showed up. my husband and i both called them multiple times but nobody answered. we waited and waited, and still heard nothing. finally, the start time arrived and my parents still weren't there. i was really pissed off at this point. the wedding coordinator asked if i wanted to go ahead and start the wedding, and i said yes. all of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate of their time. 

my parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony. it turns out they did leave early but got rear-ended at a traffic light and had to deal with insurance, police, etc. they only have a landline, no cellphones, so they couldn't get in touch with me. obviously there's no way i could have known this.

i'm still frustrated with them for not making more of an effort to get to the venue early, and they're furious at me for not delaying the wedding 15 minutes so they could be there. aita?",3
"meta: warning for all posters: what happens in does not stay in aita!. it would seem that some popular social media personalities have decided that this is a great sub for content. the ""god"" facebook page likes to mine content, look for assholes, and put them on blast via thedodo. a recent poster has also said the the ""news"" page the mirror picked up his post as well. i'm sure there are others.

"for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?. about two months ago, my husband and i got ""married"" in a beautiful ceremony. it was so much fun. we went on a honeymoon after. the price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it's their only daughter's wedding. as a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or i could afford! my husband and i paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

the wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. about a year and a half ago, i was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). i had recently graduated from school and didn't have health insurance. my husband and i decided to get married so i could join his health insurance. it was a quick justice of the peace ceremony. we were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. a few months after that, he ""proposed"" (something i didn't see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. we weren't trying to be deceptive. however, part of it was that i wasn't comfortable revealing my health issues. my husband respected this. my parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. his mom (i'll call her carol) and i aren't close. she's fine enough in low doses, but...

we're currently in the process of moving. this past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. as we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must've slipped out. carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. and then she noticed the date. 

carol lost it. she insisted we lied to everyone. she said our wedding ceremony was just a ""gift grab"" (our wedding website stated that someone's presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). carol went and called her twin sister, my husband's aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. she said we were sneaky and deceptive. she is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. 

for me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so i could get insurance. a means to an end. our wedding date is what we will celebrate. are we assholes for not being more upfront? i've been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. my husband insists we are not assholes.",3
"for refusing to use the money i inherited from my mother to pay for medical treatment for my half-sister, who has a life threatening sickness? she is the child of my father and the woman he cheated on my mother with.. when i was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. in one split second, the happy family i knew was gone, and i went through the darkest time in my life.

my parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). she never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship i wanted to have with him. i eventually forgave my dad mostly because i was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. i talk to him but i want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

my mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which i now own and operate. i am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. he was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.

this year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. the bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

the thing is, i don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when i think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and i have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. i'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. they are her parents after all. the only thing tying me to her is my father saying ""she is your sister"" and ""if she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?""

"for 100% refusing to let my dad/mom see my child for something done 10-15 years ago? /petty. ok so this is kinda complex, i'll make it short.  this acc is just for privacy reasons

-i always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. i never had problems with my parents before this. 

-i went to med school, still living with parents when i was 20, i dated someone who was 23

-dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says i cannot date j. 

-argument breaks out, dad says it's his house so either i agree or i move out. i say it's not fair as j has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. dad kicks me out. mom agrees with his decision. little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-i moved with j, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (i went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-years later, me and j (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (like really small but i'm happy with it). i ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. i let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  he came a few times. 

-today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when i was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. i said never and that i wasn't going to forgive them. bro says i'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, i say that's bullshit because dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. bro says i should at least let mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. i say mom was able to do something but didn't,but that bro's situation was different because he was only 15. bro is upset because he says mom and dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that i am dragging this entire situation. i told him that if he thinks i'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. he's angry and says that i need to move on and that i shouldn't be withholding them from seeing their grandchild. i say that they disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. 

aita? i don't hate my bro and i (kinda)  get what he is saying, but i just have a resentment for my parents. it's not like i had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks i'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. i'm curious on what reddit thinks. i want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",3
"for serving a pregnant woman a non-alcoholic cocktail?. i have waited tables for the last three years.

during my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. they were a pleasure to have as customers. they ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

when i was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, i walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. when i rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. i figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. they ordered their entrees and i went off to handle other tables.

about five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. at this point i started getting concerned, but i took the order and cheerfully said i'd be right back. this time, i went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. he was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, i told him to just trust me. 

a few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and mrs. pregnant woman was also getting into it. i figured that since she didn't notice, things were ok. the problem came when i took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. when mrs. pregnant woman got to the counter, i saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). my bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

it was too late for me to edit them back, so i just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. they all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. they were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an uber.

several minutes later mrs. pregnant woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. i fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. she blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. i said no, but told her that i assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. it was a lame lie and i'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. i did so. then she talked to my manager. my manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. 

i stood my ground and told her that i'm not going to be responsible for fas. she told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. she also informed me that i could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. 

but when i talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. the entire staff at the restaurant is against me and i think that i'm going to call in and tell my manager that i quit, but i still feel in the right here. i would like some perspective on this and if i'm the asshole here.",3
"if i started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?. i moved from georgia to the pacific northwest last year for a dream job after i graduated college. it was a little bit of a culture shock, because i went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. there hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. for example, every white woman i meet mentions beyonce to me within the first five minutes. when i was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'so... beyonce.'

so the problem in the post title is that i am the only black woman at my office, and i am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and i'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. my name is tina, short for christina. pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. for some reason, a handful of people at work call me tiana, tiara, or tia, i think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. i am most often called tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which i think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. the other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position i'm in) used to work there and i get called her name (mary) sometimes too. sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""how do you pronounce that?"" it's tina!

i have tried politely correcting this and i correct it immediately every time. from polite, ""just for the record, my name is tina!"" to lighthearted, ""tina, like tina belcher!"" in e-mails from me that say tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, i still get, ""thanks tiana!"" sooo... i'm considering doing the twitter approach, where i just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. like:

chuck: thanks, tiana

tina: no problem, chad!

jessica: hi tiara!

tina: good morning, jennifer!

would i be the asshole if i did this? i know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and i feel really disrespected by this, so i may as well have some fun with it.

edit: i am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so i just want to add a couple of things:

a lot of people have suggested that i gently and firmly remind people of my name. that's what i've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

a lot of people have suggested i go to hr. this is the kind of nebulous thing hr doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

a lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. it is. i have been black for 25 years, and i have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and i can identify it in my own life. it isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. i feel like a few people are almost getting it. a lot of people are referencing that key and peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

and finally, a few people have asked why i don't use tina turner as an example, since she's also a black tina. first, i thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with tina belcher, but i used 'tina turner' as an example for our dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me tina turner, which took deprogramming from his ea to get over.

edit #2:

no, i don't have a southern accent. i'm from atlanta, and black people from atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. more to the point, no accent makes the name 'tina' sound like 'tiana' or ""tiara""

no, the people i work with aren't just 'idiots.' as annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

no, i can't wear a 'hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. we have a business professional dress code!

yes, i correct them every time.

no, it's not because i'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

responding to this post saying, 'okay shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('tiana' being the 'shaniqua' in this instance). several people have alarmingly said, 'okay, trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'chad' is very weird!",3
"for grounding my daughter because she called my sil a ""slut""?. my daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. a boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. i believe he sent a video to her as well. before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. it appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. i notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

&#x200b;

my husband and i are respectful and non-judgmental of my sil's profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. my daughter is understandably upset and i feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. she unfriended my sil from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. she refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my sil house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. i tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

&#x200b;

my sil is hurt from all of this. not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. last weekend, i went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. my daughter refused and referred my sil as ""a vapid slut"" and her husband ""a pathetic cuck"" along with other slurs i don't want to repeat.

&#x200b;

i grounded her for three months and took away her internet. my husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that's too much. he also admitted he struggled accepting his sister's career path at first. he thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.

&#x200b;

edit: seems like my husband is right and i went too far with the punishment. i just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. i'm going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. will decide with the husband later. we're definitely concerned for our daughter about what's happening at school and we're looking into therapy.

for clarification, as for my sil's privacy, she didn't consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",3
"for cancelling my wedding because fiancee almost got my dog killed?. me (28m) and fiancee (27f) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. i also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.

on saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. i stayed with my parents but i left the dog with her because she likes having him there. however, *i made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.

5am on sunday i get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. she was drunk, so i told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. when i got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. i felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.

but then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. the girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.

when we got home, i told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. i told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and i'll tell mine. she was shocked, but she took her things and left.

2 hours later, i get bombarded by messages on messenger, whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that i am insane to do this to her after 4 years. they started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.

the logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. nope. they all fucking agree. my mom said: ""well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" lucky me, eh? my dog didn't fucking die!

my sister was appalled that i cancelled the wedding ""over *that*?!"" and even my best man said i might have overreacted. yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. but i am so disgusted at my fiancee that i can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. she isn't fucking 17, she is 27!

by the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. she likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar dangerous things. it's not something i hold against her in the sense that i would ever mention in a fight, but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. for example, my dog.

i'm 99% sure i will stand by my decision. but am i really an asshole? literally nobody is on my side and i have no idea what to think.

&#x200b;

**edit: posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. she is negligent and irresponsible and i don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. i'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. if she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, i would also leave her. i guess i realized i don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",3
"for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out.. throwaway as my dad uses reddit. 

so i'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. 

my parents decided to give me a gift for when i graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. i remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. 

that was untill i found out the terms and conditions, i can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses i can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. 

so i told my parents that i cant accept the gift as i dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,i also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. 
i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where i was called ungrateful and that i'm not a nice daughter. so i walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off. 

reflecting back i do think that i might be the asshole but i'm unsure so i've come to you. 

i will accept any judgment",3
"for suggesting that my sister chose an easy love?. my younger sister and i were very close when young but no so much now. i was born in fairly well to do hindu family. i fell in love and married a muslim man and had to convert to his religion. my family was pretty pissed off that i converted but we've kept in touch.

recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. my mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

my sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. i was happy for her.

it all began when i asked what religion he was. imagine my surprise when she said that he was hindu and the same community as our parents. this would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

i asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. she got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
i suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

i explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. it was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

she told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and i was being rude. i told her that i wasn't, i was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  i then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
at this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. at this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. she called me 'toxic'.

"for kicking out my girlfriend because she said my relationship with my brother was disgusting.. i'm(22m) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. we're very close and we have always been like that. he lives with me now obviously. he often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so i comfort him as best as i can. 

so, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. she doesn't live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn't wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. she woke us up and made a scene in front of him. she said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it's extremely concerning that he's so affectionate towards me. my brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. i brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

i went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. i told her to get the fuck out. she got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. i grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. i didn't hurt her, she was following me, i didn't use any force. she left, she called me few times but i didn't answer.


update: thanks for all the comments. i talked to her, she still said that she didn't do anything wrong,she didn't hurt my brother and it wasn't her fault that he started crying. i broke up with her. 

also little info: this doesn't happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. he laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping.",3
"update - if i still give my stepson the birthday gift i bought for him despite his mother asking me to hold it off for a month because she knows my gift will upstage hers and she wants to see him enjoy her gift first?. hi reddit, just dropping by to give you an update to my post. 

 https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cyadgx/wibta\_if\_i\_still\_give\_my\_stepson\_the\_birthday/(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cyadgx/wibta_if_i_still_give_my_stepson_the_birthday/) 

jack celebrated his birthday in september, and as many of you suggested, i told him that i'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. that way it didn't look like kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy kim's gift. 

kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that i was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. it's flattering to read that so many of you think that joe and i are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with kim. it was humbling for kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

for those who are asking, i didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because i wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone i know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. but since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, i bought jack a horse. my family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem. 

jack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!

thank you all for your comments and i wish everyone the best.",3
"update: for refusing to give my newborn's social security number to my aunt.. link to a snapshot of my op(https://reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bwoxwx/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_newborns_social/epz1kn2/)

i was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. my aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. i explained why exactly i didn't feel good about giving her leyla's social security number. they both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn't see anything wrong with it.

after explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn't have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. we ended up working out a compromise - my wife and i opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. everything seemed to have worked out well.

yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from romania. she had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. she said it completely justified my hesitation. her information was stolen in the equifax breach a couple of years ago.

moral of the story: trust your gut on financial matters. while my mom and aunt had good intentions in mind, you really can't be too careful these days.",3
"aita? my husband and i are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. his mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but i don't want to do that.. my stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and i decided that we will be getting him a car. i make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. that's fine with me.

his mother is a woman who i make the effort to be civil with but don't like. i am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. she called me her ex's cash cow and that's one of the better things she said about me. we are not friends and i won't even describe her as nice to me.

when my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

i don't want to do that. i don't need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. i don't want recognition for paying 70% of his gift's cost but i don't want to share my and my husband's gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

i don't know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we've never given my stepson a gift jointly before. and i don't understand what's so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

i know that many people will say that it's better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. i'm civil to his mom and i never talk negatively about her to him. is that not enough? am i incapable of being a good step mother to him if i'm not best friends with his mom? do i have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",3
"for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning a car and making other contestants lose?. this is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

i live on an obscure little island near the uk. we have a local quiz show that's aired on the telly that i appeared on a few years ago. 

the premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. i sailed through a lot of the physical part because i wasn't a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so i was ok there.

as for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box 'room' filled with something you're terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

i thought of a believable lie before i entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and i put down all the things i'm *not* scared of. i listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. i literally couldn't care less about any of these creatures. i grew up in rural landscape and i've had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it's not an issue. my actual fear is a bit more obscure and i really honestly knew i'd fail if i was put in a room with it. 

when i entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* i was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross i can't lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

i did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. the rest of the contestants failed.

now, i won a pretty average car which i didn't particularly want, so as soon as i legally could i sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

i told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think i cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

i'm obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",3
"for spiking my leftovers with ghost pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson. so my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. after several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. a few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. i wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing i'd eat it the next day. 

since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. i got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. i open the fridge grab my box and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. i know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so i knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

i'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon i decided to sprinkle ghost pepper flakes on the last two slices. we actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. so i'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. this fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. after he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and i get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. i hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",3
"for telling my parents i won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?. i'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. i have a car that i bought with money i'd saved from work, and i pay my own gas. however my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

they said i need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. and the problem is that i get motion sick easily; even when i'm driving. too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when i'm in a car make me feel ill too.

i'm not exaggerating, i've always been like this. as a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. i always make sure i know where my barf bag is on a plane. i always used to take motion sickness pills, but i'm not allowed when i'm driving because they make you tired.

anyway, i can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me i literally feel so sick because of his bo. even with the windows on my side open

my friend told me i should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

so i did that and told my mom and dad that i couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. either they could check or i would. and they blew up at me saying that i was being nasty and humiliating, that if i wouldn't drive my brother i couldn't drive. and i said fine; i'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

and that caused a big fight, because i guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

"for insisting if i can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?. throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

so i 20m live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend 23f, a guy from my uni course 20m and his cousin 26f. for the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. however this has been a real point of contention lately. 

about six months ago i began a relationship with a guy i've known for a couple of years 21m. i know it's still a fairly new relationship but i really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. this was mostly due to the fact that i have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch tv and get takeout or cook together. i didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10pm because of his work schedule. 

so the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that i need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". i asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". i pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. she said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. i confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. i asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. i pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

my potential assholery: i've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  if i answer the door to anyone's partner i'll send them away. if i come home and someone's partner is there i'll make a point to mention that i thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. i've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me i'm being unreasonable. i know i'm being petty, but i think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and i'm trying to make that point. am i really the asshole here?

eta: some questions people keep asking: 
1. if i knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something i'd have included it. i'm not aware of anything he does and when i ask why 26f doesn't like him i just get a shrug and ""just do"". i will also state i'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners i've had. 
2. we don't hang out in the living room much. we literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that i can't get on my bedroom tv and there's nobody else in there. we use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. a lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26f, *not* my best friend. my best friend is 23f. not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago i was moving out of halls at university and 23f was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. at the same time, a dude from my course - 20m - was looking for a flatshare. we couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26f - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. i only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.
4. by chronic fatigue i mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",3
"for telling my gf's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me to pay?. me and diomara (12f) have had a rough summer.  she's been more defiant than usual.  i've been dating her mom mara (30f) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, maple (33m).  both dio and mara have an on again/off again relationship with dio's dad (dynasis).  he's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into dio's life.   typical shitty-ass part time dad.  i've tried to fill the dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200b;

this summer dynasis decides he wants to be a real dad and takes dio in for a month.  good for him, not my business, and mara agrees.  when dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  really mean to me, very dismissive.  a few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  security took her in then called mara, who didn't answer, then called dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  i answered.  they told me i had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200b;

i didn't say anything to her while i picked her up.  i apologized to security, apologized to the store.  i even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  i assured them dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200b;

i'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  not yelling, but in a fatherly tone, i suppose.  i'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how i dont fuck with thieves, and how i absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so i don't appreciate any of this nor will i accept it in my house.  she snaps back that i'm not her dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  from now on, if i wanna tell her something i need to clear it with her real father first.  

&#x200b;

that killed my soul.  for the past year or so, i've treated her as my own daughter.  i've paid for their housing, i've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  her bio dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  the fuckin check bounced so i had to call him up and he brought cash over.  i told mara about all of this.  she was appalled at what dio said, but she never made dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her dad.""

&#x200b;

a couple of days later dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  i say go ask your dad.  she scoffs and says her dad doesn't have the money for it, so i have to pay for it.  i tell her...i'm not her dad so don't ever tell me what i have to pay for.  she cried to mara, who tells me i'm not being an adult about the situation.  mind you, i never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  mara says dio is a kid and i need to stop acting like a kid too.",3
"for not picking my girlfriend up for a birthday meal and telling everyone she is probably asleep because she ignored my text. unfortunately my girlfriend's social skills aren't excellent and as a result whenever she is annoyed at me she is totally incapable of expressing why she is annoyed, so she resorts to totally ignoring me.

yesterday at 1:00 we were supposed to meet up for a birthday meal for a good friend. in the morning i sent her a few messages saying ""what time should i pick you up"" and such, all of which went ignored. i decided to just pretend that she was asleep and i went without her. when i arrived i just made a joke saying ""i think she's still asleep"", she hasn't replied to any of my messages. at about 12:45 i got a string of messages asking where i was and what's going on. i just played dumb and said ""wait, you're ready? i thought you were still in bed or something??""

i knew fine well that she was ready to leave the house but i didn't want to play this stupid game and i don't like the disrespect of being totally ignored like this, so i just decided to not pick her up.

obviously she was mad at me and had no idea how to express her emotions besides bursts of anger and then ghosting.",3
"if i told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?. so my situation is a little difficult so i thought i would confide in the good professional people of reddit. couple days ago me and my brother we're hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. we haven't seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what's been going on the past few years. towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the ""secrets"" i mentioned something along the lines that i smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (this was hard for me to tell because my whole life i was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) we both laughed about it saying ""just don't let mom find out"" the joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out ""i cheated on my wife..."" at first it didn't register until i saw his face and he was dead serious. i for one hate cheaters, but i try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. he begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. she would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. he told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. during this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. he told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. pretty much after his wife's travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. they've both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (they have a kid) 
he told me life has been good to him now and he's just thankful things have finally worked out. 

as stated before i hate cheaters and i've always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. i know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. my heart tells me i have to tell her because it's the right thing to do, especially because i've known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. my brain tells me it's none of my business and i should keep my mouth shut. i don't want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. on one hand i betray my brother if i say something on the other hand i betray our close family friend because i know this secret and i don't say anything. i wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. so there it is, if i said something?

tldr: brother cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now i feel obligated to tell his wife because she's a close friend. wibta?

edit: i'm referring sil as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are very close lol. i thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just sil, but it looks like i was wrong.

second edit: wow this is on the front page, i never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! i'm sorry i can't reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",3
"for telling my waitress's manager she did a great job?. not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. i got called an asshole for it, so now i have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.

i met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. two nights ago was our third date and i was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. nothing fancy, i just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. this girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. she's funny, charming, and smart. we had had several great dates and i was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. she is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)

our waitress for dinner was great. actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. at one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.

at the end of the meal, she brought the check and i told her i would like to speak with her manager. she asked if there was something wrong, and i calmly repeated that i would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. she leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and i proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. he thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.

the only one not happy was my date. she said, ""if that was supposed to impress me, it didn't."" and said that i was full of myself. she didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. i texted her saying i was sorry for whatever i did wrong and that i'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.

so pardon my french, but what the fuck?",3
"for telling my son that if he changes his last name then i'm no longer his father?. let me start off by saying my son, adam, is 22 years old. back when my ex wife, tori, and i were trying for kids we found out that i was infertile. we decided we'd adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. i was thrilled because i thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. no, i was wrong. my ex wife cheated on me and i didn't find out until 20 years later. 

tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he's not my biological son. my ex and i divorced a few weeks later. ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological father. he did and they started to become really close. it hurt me much more than i thought it would. 

he's an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. they started to bond really well, and all of a sudden adam became really distant from me. it's been like this for almost a year and a half. i try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he's busy with chris (biological father). i tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. we used to do stuff every other week but it's been completely different since he found out about chris.

i couldn't stand it. my son who i raised since he was a baby treated me like i didn't matter. any time we'd actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. what i mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. i'd ask him how classes or friends were and he'd just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. he also changed his major from econ to computer science and didn't even mention it to me until a year later. 

i told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he'd do better. he never did. i told him numerous times and he never changed. he was still distant.

what was the final straw for me was the phone conversation i had with him last week. he said he was going to change his last name to chris' because he liked it so much and because they were close. i couldn't believe what i was hearing. i told him this ""i can't believe you are going to do this. that's really disappointing to me. if you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then i'm no longer your father and i don't want to be involved in your life."" 

he hung up on me. i didn't even bother reaching out because i know he wouldn't respond. i stand by what i said. i meant every word and still do. the last name change to me means he no longer views me as a father and views chris as his (despite the fact he's 22).

my family told me i'm being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it's reasonable. i was told to post it here. so reddit am i being an asshole?

info: something to add. after i found out about chris i took a couple of days and didn't speak to my ex wife or adam. they didn't contact me. i didn't contact them. i needed a break.

edit 2: a lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and i think i finally figured out why he's been so cold. a few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. his grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that i am fully in charge of. enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. after a semester of university he started dating this girl. he was head over heels in love with her. 

i never met the girl so i have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. suddenly after a few months of dating adam asked me for about $3k to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. i already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. i asked adam why he needed the money. he said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

i told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. he spent over 1k on her in just under a few months. he would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. to me she was just after my son's inheritance and i was right. what i said to him was basically this ""adam, you haven't been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn't sit well with me. that's the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. if you 2 were more serious then i would think about it, but i'm not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend."" turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. they broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

he was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. then we found out about my ex's affair. i don't know if that's the real reason he's so cold. that was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",3
"for being mad that my birthday gift was sex?. on my gf's birthday i gave her a necklace that i spent $400 on.  i wasn't expecting her to spend the same as me, but i was expecting something.

"for asking my cousin not to bring his autistic son (my nephew) to my home any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife?. i know from the title, it definitely sounds like i would be the asshole but please hear me out. i have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. my nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (i don't know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. 

recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we've hosted them in the past when they've visited. the first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. he drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. my wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. he told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

this weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. his mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn't pay attention to him as much as before. he got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. when my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. i stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. here's the part where i may be the asshole. i told my cousins i didn't feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and i know for sure she didn't, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. i told them i couldn't allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. i apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. they didn't say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

i guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that i should've been more understanding and that i was wrong to ask them to leave. 

am i the asshole?

edit for added info: 

thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. there's not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when i saw how many had reached out to me), but i wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. the first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. my dad is an only child so the cousin i refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad's first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). i'm not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). the reason i refer to him as my nephew is because he's the generation after mine in our family tree and it's less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. a lot of people have posted that it's not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, i don't care, and my family's never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. i apologize if it was misleading in my post. without being specific, in the western state i was born and grew up in, it's not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. i call him my nephew because my cousin and i were close and i still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though i don't know how after this situation). 

2. some have asked if i was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. the first time, i thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. remember, in my mind he's my nephew and i never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. regarding the situation that happened this weekend, i was only concerned for my wife and son's safety. i didn't know how he would react and followed my cousin's lead, but wasn't about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. i don't know what was said to my paternal grandmother but i don't want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we've both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",3
"for turning the home i inherited into an airbnb? my sister thought it would be a ""family home"" forever..  i will try to keep it very short so as to not bore anyone. about six months or so ago my grandpa died. for simplicity sake, let's say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. in his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  his estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in california. basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. m

i got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. for the last six months i've allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but i just got my first tax bill and i either have to sell it or start making some income off it. after talking to the real estate agent i've decided the best course of action is to put it on airbnb. that way i can still use it if i like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there's not someone renting full-time.

 my sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all i know she's upset because she can no longer use the house for free. but she's also telling me that i basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. she has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. she also says it's not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but i still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house i could stay there any time i want.  she's my older sister and i've always been impressionable to the things she says to me and i'm feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. am i the asshole here?",3
"for being honest with my nephew about where i was for most of his life?. okay, let me just get right into this. i 27m was kicked out at 16 because my older sister 37f outed me to my parents as gay. they completely cut off all contact with me and i didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. when i was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. for the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

a couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and i ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. he asked me why i wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. i asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. i told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until i eventually confessed i was cut off for being gay. he made a face and asked how my parents even found out. i told him i was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that i don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. he got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

i got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that i'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". i explained to her that i didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and i think he's old enough to deserve honesty. she just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. i'm crushed because obviously i love the kid. did i do the wrong thing? should i have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",3
"for telling my sister to get over her daughter's achievements?. i am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. they're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

my sister paula's daughter amy is the most successful of the bunch. she's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

i don't dislike amy but she's always been trouble. i have a daughter the same age as her, charlotte. when they were younger amy did a great job convincing charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

when amy graduated, paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then paula has gone out of her way to make amy the centre of attention everywhere. over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. amy wanted to go too and paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from x''. amy behaved like a brat the entire time and paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. i don't mind this but they do, but once again paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

the final straw came last weekend. my son mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. paula, her husband rob, and amy were there, and paula set about trying to convince me to let amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. mark's fiancee vicky barely knows amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. paula said amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

i was frustrated and told paula that amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. i told paula amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying i was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public. 

amy isn't a child, and pointing out the truth is not humiliation.",3
"for being upset because my son didn't talk to me, but talked to my wife.. i'm 40m, my wife is 39f, son in 15. 

yesterday when it was dinner time i called him to come downstairs few times. he didn't answer me so i assumed that he didn't hear me. i went upstairs and knocked on his door, he said he'd come downstairs in few minutes. after 15 minutes he still didn't come downstairs so i walked in his room. i knocked first. he was obviously crying. i asked him what was wrong but he didn't answer me so i didn't push him more. 

 i went downstairs and told my wife about it. she went upstairs to talk to him and stayed there for half an hour. she came back and brought him food upstairs. when i asked her what was wrong she said that it wasn't anything important and told me to drop it. i got kind of upset because i want to know what was wrong and i'm his parent as well. 

i haven't been fully ignoring them but i've been acting kinda distant since yesterday. my wife got mad at said that i was acting extremely immature.",3
"for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 ford bronco i owned as a teenager?. so how to begin with this...i realize that on paper i am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations i'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even i did the right thing. 

when i was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 ford bronco. it was my true passion and i don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. plus my dad and i would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when i was teenager it was always that bronco that brought us back together. i made a huge mistake and sold the truck when i turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, i've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

we had a baby in early february. she is our first and the light of my life. my wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. i guess i need to say this. 

two weeks ago i was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. i stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. my dad and i had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so i just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't my bronco! 

i asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on i-25 as we spoke from colorado to buy it for $21000. i freaked out and asked him if i could buy it right then and there for $23000. he said if i could come up with the cash, yes. i had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so i had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, i maxed out my credit card to venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and i fucking drove away in my old car. it was like a dream come true. like a literal dream come true. it needs a lot of work i can't afford right now but it's mine. like in my driveway mine. again. i can't even describe what a joy this is. 

my wife and her parents are furious with me. they feel i was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. my point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. but this bronco means everything to me and if i wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. to me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

like i said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. how do you guys see it?

edit: had no idea this would go so one way. i guess i messed up. i talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. the $4k will be a gift and she's going to give me whatever i need to restore it. she's always been awesome to me and she's rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. sorry to get everyone so mad at me, i was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the ""mommy bailed you out"" comments really necessary ? i found a solution and it's coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it's not like i'm not paying for it on my own eventually.

edit 3: my inbox is so buried i have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. does anyone know what those are ?

edit4: i'm getting a 403 error whenever i try to respond, not sure what that means but i'm still reading because honestly i'm afraid to go home even with the great news i know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? i messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/snausagefest since you're a mod, do you know? i can't respond to any posts and get the ""status 403"" whenever i try. thanks!

edit in the morning: i couldn't figure out why i was getting so many private's  but i guess this must be locked now. i didn't tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and said i found a buyer for the bronco. i'll figure out how to cross that bridge when i get there but my wife was so relieved that i ""had come to your senses"" i don't want to disappoint her. it's going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",3
"meta you can still be the asshole if you were wronged. i've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, i've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. op was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? and there is a resounding chorus of nta! you don't owe anyone anything! or someone was mean to op, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. aita?  no! they were rude so you get to be as well! 

i dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. these reactions are understandable. but just because its understandable doesn't mean op can't be the asshole. 

being wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. people make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  it is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown. ""they started it"" didn't work in kindergarten and it shouldn't now. 

this sub isn't ""was this person in the wrong to do this to me"" its ""am i the asshole.""  esh exists. nah exists. ""nta, but you should still apologize/try better next time"" exists. let's all try and be a little more nuanced&empathetic.",3
"for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children. saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

a few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. her husband is a light black man. of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. the skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

i pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. she didn't even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. i reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. neither has spoken to me since.

i've always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they're still married and sometimes i feel bad about what happened. i just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because i would be devastated if i wasn't confident that i was the father of my future children. was i an asshole for asking privately?

edit- okay i get it i'm an asshole. i want to make it clear that i didn't think the triplets had different fathers. i'm not an idiot. i thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",3
"for not giving my empty row of plane seats to a mother with toddlers?. this happened a couple weeks ago, but i'm still conflicted about it, so here goes. 

i travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. most recently, i was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. this wouldn't be a problem except that i had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket i paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way i had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (because i take this specific route and airline a lot, i knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can't recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since i just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)

of course, when it came time to board, i get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. i politely told her that she'd made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before i got there, and would i do her the favor of just switching?

here's the thing: if circumstances were different, i would have! but i explained that i had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that i could sleep. i really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids' seatbelts right then and there. 

by this point the plane is filling up, i'm blocking the aisle, it's causing a whole thing, so i just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. the mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. the flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as i did) goes, ""this is an exit row. your kids can't sit there because they're not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. there's not going to *be* another empty row. please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.""

so i sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and i figure that's the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, i push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. when we land, i'm getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, ""you look like you slept well, bitch.""

so, reddit. am i the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?

**edited to add:** okay, thanks reddit, i think most of you agree that i'm not the asshole here. but please do me a favor and don't refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. the kids were just fine. they watched something on their ipad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. kids don't like flying more than anyone else, and it's not these girls' fault their mom acted like a jerk.",3
"for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?. i'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. i mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. she embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. personally, i have nothing against this at all. i am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. however, i do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. i don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

however, despite being a ""supporter,"" anna regularly comments on my body type. for example, i always bring food for my shifts since i personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). anna will often say things like, ""you should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""you look skinnier than last week. i told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" she'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if i was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that i look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" one time i was changing into my work shirt in the back and anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" i have no idea what that even means but i doubt it was a compliment.

these hypocritical comments have pissed me off. i enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and i enjoy working out and staying toned. anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. i don't think this is healthy. 

finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy i kinda like came in to get some food and i was super excited to see him. he turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. oh well. anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""maybe he's into curvier girls."" i basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. i asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. then i told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (i called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

she called me insecure and told me i was being a rude bitch. it was reaching the end of our shift so i clocked out early and left so i didn't have to argue with her more. i was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. she said that i was right and all but that i was insensitive in the way i brought it up and suggested that i apologize. i'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",3
"for possibly stealing from a convenience store multiple times and not saying anything about it.. for the last year i've had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. 


about a week ago i went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if i wanted a receipt. at this point i figured i had just used a deal i don't know about, but the next time i went the same thing happened. so the next several times i've gone i've made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it's been free.


i'm thinking something is wrong and i should tell someone, but i kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. aita?

update: hi guys

i thought i had the golden ticket, i really did. 

i thought i had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. the rewards card that wouldn't stop rewarding. last night i dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


i wanted to ask you fine people if i was the asshole real quick before i went balls deep and pilfered my way through a midwest convenience store chain. i'll be honest i didn't care what people said though. i was high on the fact that i had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


after i made the post i made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, ""i mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it's good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn't steal""


i made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause i was sleepy. and then i went to perform the maneuver. i strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

it was a gift card. 


i had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, i found it and my dumb little brain couldn't read the text that said ""gift card"" on the bottom.

i'm not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like ""alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82."" but i sucked it up and paid, and now all i have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

tl;dr i thought i had it all but now i just have a lot of eggs.

"for dropping the ""we're not having kids, now stop bringing it up"" bomb on my mil?.  my husband and i don't want kids. my mil is big into family in the traditional sense. she has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

my husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. every time we see her, she asks. everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""we might not even have kids"" and mil would *not*hear it. at year 4, husband had a vasectomy and i had a tubal.

so this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some bbq and drinks and everything. when i get up to grab a beer, my mil asks me if maybe i should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

i was annoyed by this and said ""there's really no chance.""

mil, all wide-grin, said, ""oh come on! it's time for you two to finally get serious! put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

i said ""we've been official for about 5 years now, mil,"" and drink the beer. husband laughs with me.

mil gets more annoyed and says ""well, you won't be real (lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

husband said, ""mom, enough."" mil pushed again. husband repeated.

after about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, i finally snapped and said ""mil, husband got snipped. i had my tubes tied. we're not having kids. you need to stop bringing it up. period.""

well, i thought i started wwiii. she started crying and stormed off. family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. we left. party kinda ended. the social media bullshit started shortly after. vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. some meme about how ""i guess i wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" it's obnoxious to the point that i just muted all of them.

my mil finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if husband and i came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. i told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""well then, i guess you two aren't prepared to be real (lastname)s. i'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (it wasn't that much. it was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

i hung up on her. when recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that i was the asshole here for dropping it like that. but i don't think she was ever going to drop it if i didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. so aita?",3
"for buying an extra airline seat (and utilizing it) even though i don't need it?. i hate flying to the point that i will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. it's not that i'm scared of flying, i just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

so i only fly if i can buy a second seat (or third if i'm flying with my wife). it lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class and for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. i'm a big guy but i 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

on multiple flights i've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no i bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem.

i look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients i've never heard of. i order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki i think ($18). very important, these were listed as entrees on the menu. mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

so anyway we order as we are starving. my steak arrives and i am shocked, it's like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. i joke to the waiter ""where's the rest of my steak?"" and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. i don't care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it's absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it's highway robbery. when i go to restaurants i expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

i'm complaining to my girlfriend and she's getting annoyed with me. similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. granted the food was pretty good but i can not get over how tiny these portions are. i'm a big guy and i like to eat, what can i say. 

when the waiter comes back i inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. my girlfriend is begging me to stop but that's where we're different, i don't let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

a manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. i don't end up paying as they realized i called them out on their bullshit. my girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. im still hungry so i drive through mcdonald's and get a burger, and when i did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. it's now the next day and i'm starting to think i didn't handle the situation as well as i could have (i could have probably just asked for a discount). my girlfriend hasn't responded to my texts so now i'm starting to think i'm an asshole.

am i the asshole?",3
"for telling my husband his friend is no longer welcome at our house?. so, my husband has this friend, i'll call him alex. alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don't share his far right views. the rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn't invited to game nights anymore. if you tell him alex, i want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he'll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying ""you just can't defend your side so you're too afraid to talk about it.""

anyway, one day, my husband had alex and another friend over, joe. they were working on a project out in the garage together. i was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. i have a huge dog that isn't fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40°f outside so she couldn't go out there with them. luckily i had my best friend over to help, but still. so while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. nbd. when the pup finally goes to sleep, alex came inside to get something. i told him ""your dog is asleep. don't wake her, it's finally peaceful in here."" and what does he do? comes over to pet her and mess with her. so i told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because i wasn't going to spend my night keeping the peace when i wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn't live anywhere near me. 

anyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until i couldn't hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. i walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said ""it's so loud that we can't hear the tv"". 

alex responded with ""well turn up your tv then."" i had a moment where i was too shocked to speak. so i unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it's my house, not his.

apparently after i left, he started talking about how annoying i was *to my husband* and that he thought i acted bitchy. my husband told me all of this later that night in bed and i asked what he said to alex. ""nothing, really"" i got angry with my husband, and told him that he should've stood up for me. we had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. 

the next day, i told my husband that alex was no longer welcome in our home. my husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so i compromised with ""alex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.""

"for going to my sister's dream school when she just got rejected?. update(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

so, i got into cornell last week. honestly i think it was fluke. i'm not smart, at all. i got a 28 act, a decent gpa (because my school grade inflates considerably). i had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like cornell. but anyways...

my twin sister is the opposite of me. she's a genius, she has way more impressive stats (34 act and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. i didn't and still don't mind, it's true. the only reason i can fathom i got in and she didn't is that she applied to the engineering college while i applied to arts and sciences (i don't know if too many of you guys are familiar with cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  unfortunately for my sister, she didn't get into a single one, including her first choice (cornell). she checked as soon as it was available and called me bawling. i consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

well anyways, i pretty much resolved that i was getting rejected, so i didn't even bother to look at my email until later that night. well, i guess surprises do happen sometime, because i'm a cornellian. i got in. i just don't know how but i did. 

i really want to go guys. but this would devastate my sister. all week she's been crying and solemn and sad. she's been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  she's decided to go to nyu, but she just hasn't been herself. i haven't told our parents (i think they assumed i didn't get in because she didn't). 

am i being selfish? should i just go with her to nyc? we always thought we were going to school together but like... it's cornell. i couldn't in a million years imagine i'd get in. i've been researching obsessively about it and i can't shake the desire that if i don't go, i'll regret it. ithaca looks beautiful, it's a small town (which i would love to get away with from the huge city that is new york). it seems like a dream opportunity. 

am i being a bad sister? i know she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. it would crush her. i really don't have anyone else to talk to :(. for going to her dream school? especially considering how much harder she's worked compared to me...

tldr: dumb sister (me) gets into cornell. smart sister didn't. she's depressed. it was her first choice. i want to go tho. aita?

update: so everyone here told me that i should go, so i decided to tell my sister. 

well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn't i tell her earlier and she's so proud of me

but seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. she went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. like uncontrollably bawling. i tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

i going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

update 2: please let me know if my updates are annoying; i only expected 3-4 comments and didn't know so many people were interested, so i thought least i could do is update 

so after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. it said:

> i'm sorry for how i reacted; please don't be mad. i'm so happy for you and your accomplishments. it's just that after i got rejected, i at least had the consolation that i get to go to school with you and we can go together. but now you're going to be where i wanted to be and i'm just so sad. i worked so hard and did everything i could to go to the best school i can and i just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. i'm sorry i'm ranting i just need more time

i'm not going to lie guys, when i read this, i cried. a lot of you are saying that i obviously i have to have attributes that made me desiresble but i really don't. i don't deserve my acceptance. i did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest ap classes available, etc. meanwhile i see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. she deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. i'm really strongly just considering going to nyu with her. everyone at cornell will just be just like her and i don't stand a chance. and i know if i go to cornell, we're going to drift apart which would suck because we're best friends and i just don't want to lose my sister :(

update 3: so i told my parents and they did not react how i would've expected them to. first, they tried to insist that cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be impossible; if we applied to the same school within cornell, like we both applied to arts and sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. they couldn't have mixed them up). 

then they went on to explain how i should go to nyu with my sister. i thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to cornell if i didn't get in. my sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would i not go to cornell, and they said how it was unfair that i basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. i don't know if i'm being dramatic, but that hurt. i knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that i don't deserve my spot sucks. even though they're probably right.

i stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. she asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that i 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. my parents were shocked because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. this started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. i'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. i realize that i have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. i'm glad i have my sister actually believe in me.

i still don't know if i want to go to nyu or cornell, mostly because i just don't want to go to school without her. she's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. at the end of the day, i always thought the nyu was going to be the school i was going to, so i wouldn't lose much by choosing it over cornell. i'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. thanks again everybody for your comments; i wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that i got in.

update 3.5: no new news but i just wanted to say that i'm reading every single comment and i apologize if i don't get to you individually and i appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! you guys are amazing :)",3
"for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?. for the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. i'll call her princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. she is a medical researcher (studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. i was apprehensive because i know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

we have a 4 bedroom house. me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler freddie. i told sister that princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed ok with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. princess even said it would be ok to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. it's getting a lot colder now and i'd never let freddie sleep outside. 

i told princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

in all honesty i was right in thinking having princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. she goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

she's also rude to my kids. my daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but princess was lovely enough to say that if her bf had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and i had a word with princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. i made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. i also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that i wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. sorry but how can i be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

edit: a lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. i won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. firstly to the people who have claimed i was acting snobby about princess's job. that wasn't the case. i wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that i could say she's ''only a researcher''. on the contrary, i specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. she earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. she just wanted more money to herself. 

also, the people who claim that i was being nasty to her because i didn't like her and things like that. i don't dislike her at all. i was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, i've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. i was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. she has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because princess constantly bullied her. 

regarding the dog's room. there isn't any furniture in freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

and for those who think i was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. we tried our best to make her feel welcome. gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. we gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, i went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. within her first week here, princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

regarding the weed and clubbing thing: i've nothing against weed use. i smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and i'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. if she was doing it away from the house i would not care at all. i wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. i'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. however, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

last but not least, i didn't call her ''princess'' on here offensively. i wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",3
"for watching got on an airplane?. two days ago, i was on a long-haul flight. i was sitting in an aisle seat. since i haven't seen games of thrones yet, i was looking forward to binge watch the first season. i made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. an hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that i need to turn it off immediately. a little bit confused, i asked why. she told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. while i agree with that, i told her that i'm not going to turn it off. she then basically told me that i am an asshole for not considering other people around me. is she right?

edit: i want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:

\- i was wearing headphones all the time.

\- it was a flight with swiss from europe to a city in the united states. the in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. however i have to admit that probably none was as bad as got. however, none of these shows was censored as far as i can tell.

"for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper?. my sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  i was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. she got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. she said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so i can see how long it takes her if i want to know so badly. so, i did. i got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later i was done. i guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what i did in half an hour.  she once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine i lied about how long it takes because i hate cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.

"update to for telling my disabled son and his partner i disapprove of their relationship?.  

my original posting: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c6lmmh/aita\_for\_telling\_my\_disabled\_son\_and\_his\_partner(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c6lmmh/aita_for_telling_my_disabled_son_and_his_partner)

my son has moved back in with me last weekend.

the older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

i got a phone call from my son on saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

i jumped into my car and brought him home. i also yelled at the man and told him i'm calling the cops.

i then called an officer i knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

when we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

so while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

i'm happy he is rid of that predator but i'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

i have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

i hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

"for sending my son to school in a dress. my son started second grade last week. i get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). 

he's got a twin sister. i told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. my son picked one up and said ""i want to wear this."" i'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. i'm pretty politically neutral so while i wouldn't say i was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that i could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

i figured ok, i wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so i shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

i drop him off and get to work. three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. he was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. 

my wife is irate asking how i couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and i was setting our son up to fail. so is just about everyone else i've run this by. my wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and i was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because i was in a rush and our son suffered for it. 

at the time, i truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that i put my son in harm's way so now i'm not sure whether i made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. aita",3
"for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?. a few months ago, my brother and now sil announced their intention to marry. the invitation to the wedding stated ""no dress code. wear whatever is comfortable for you."" in hindsight, i think they put that there since the event was at a lake. i didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, i should dress respectably for such an occasion, and i have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. i chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

yesterday was the wedding. when i showed up, i noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than i was. i'm talking polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. i did feel a little out of place. my brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my sil was wearing a modest white dress. the only comment i got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying i looked like i'm marrying the sil, but that was it.

a few hours ago, i got a call from sil. holy shit, she is pissed at me! she was asking why i dressed like a pimp, i upstaged her and my brother, and i stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. i referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and i was dressing respectfully. she was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. i told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. she asked if i was that retarded. i told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. i hung up. she spammed my phone with calls, so i blocked her and texted my brother i'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

was i in the wrong?

edit: clarified she said i stuck out on the photos.

edit 2: my brother said i'm welcome to come over for dinner later. i unblocked her number. no call spam, so that's a good sign.

edit 3: had dinner with my brother and sil earlier. she showed me the pictures, and i can kind of see what she was talking about. i told her i'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because i did notice i was out of place and i should have tried to do something. she said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. so yeah, i don't think we're gonna be on jerry springer as far as i can tell.",3
"for telling a friend's friend that he couldn't keep the ""jackpot"" that he hit on my antique slot machine? (about $700). i had a party at my house last night. i have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. my step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. maybe a max of $50 at a time. as far as i know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. i'd never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

well a friend's friend hit the jackpot last night. i was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. his case was hed been playing with his own money and i would have kept his quarters. my argument  was i'd be happy to give him his quarters back if he'd asked but i'm not a casino and while i'm not destitute, i can't afford to give someone $700. argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he'd be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. i have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

so was i the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

edit: sorry guys i can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because i've been banned.

edit2: wow since i'm a ""baby gangster"" who has been running an ""illegal gaming operation"" (both things that have been said) i might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. i'm really that bad? i just thought i had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>if this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. forget our votes, listen to those. also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

if the moderators allow me to update, i will absolutely update and tell you how many friends i've lost. almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the ""winner"" thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. and he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). in addition, i will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (az) and ask what trouble i might be in. i will also update on that when i can. people can't be this dramatic in real life...i'm a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and i'm still blown away by some of these comments. call me yta all you like, but don't be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don't  in the process.

edit4: well i was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  makes info hard but i'll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why i can't ""afford"" to give it to him. 

say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? another friend says wow, that's cool i have $1.25 in my pocket, can i donate to your change jar? you'd say yes. now let's say a guy you've never met says ""hey i just put .80 into your change jar, now i'm taking the whole thing."" you would say no. it's how i've always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. i've given people quarters to play, i've taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. i've taken in maybe $100 over five years. maybe. that's a nickel a day. that's not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


edit5: a good question:

>info did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? if no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

no he did not, the first time i ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  i don't mind if people play it, i even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

edit6: another good question

>also, need more info. you stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). did you let them keep it? if so, why are you making a double-standard here?


i would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. i do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why i'm asking here. but i do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits i wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

edit7: 

>info
we need to know where the money came from. did the money in the machine come from you putting it in or playing the machine

so this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). she said it gets full at $800. it was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, i always guessed $500. in five years it's now 7/8ths full. i play it from to time to time so i'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. i think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night i've ever seen that window empty. i know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so i may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if i'm way off base.

edit8: this is the best yta take so far and i can't let it get buried.

> i really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you'll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. i love the comments that say ""your edits make you yta! alone. where did the money come from btw?""  i truly can accept the yta votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. i wasn't profiting off this machine. i've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. i can't afford to give a random dude $700. i don't need it now, but i have savings account i don't need it now either but i might some day. and now i've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. so good thing i hung onto them right ? (i can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. i never cleaned it out because honestly i like the way it looked with the coins in the window. this thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. some nice ntas have suggested i have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. i actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (i got it five years ago) so i always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. as an example, over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. i had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. he was heartbroken when he didn't win (i might have given it to him since he was so cute) but i gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so i always, always give people money back if they ask. i never intended to profit off the machine. no one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>i bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who dm'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, i was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. my slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said i could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. in my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. so it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. there wasn't a jackpot at all. i don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. the guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  i still don't care if i'm yta till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. and fuck that guy.


edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that i will not be allowed to update this post. so the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. so had i been a real casino i would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. so yeah, i was totally in the right. fuck this sub. fuck the moderators. and fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. most of you however were cool.",3
"for telling my grandma she looks like ronald mcdonald because she wouldn't stop telling me i look like a bull with my nose ring in?. edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought i'd make an edit. my piercing is not a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. septum piercings are usually tagged as ""looking like a bull"" (i don't agree with that) but i have my hoop in my nostril.

here's how it happened. every time i see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of ""take that thing out of your nose, you're ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull."" the last time she said it to me i politely asked her to leave it alone or next time i wouldn't be so polite. to be fair this is the first time i spoke up because i'm not confrontational but the older i get the more i stand up for myself. and for that matter, i shouldn't even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. i immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like ronald mcdonald. a lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but a) i warned her and asked her to stop and b) she's insulting my appearance so why is what i said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? i'm usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn't even make sense) does not ""ruin"" my face and even if it does it's really not her place. i'm a grown ass woman and i refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman. 

so, was i the asshole?",3
"for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes?. first up please know i am trying my best to be kind in my wording. i run a small operation where i guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. i have served all kinds of clients.

i got an inquiry for a group called ""womens+ adventures"" and because it was during pride month, i thought maybe it was an lgbtq+ group. i chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and i started the training plan.

the group wanted to work up to ""a 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. going off what everyone reported, i decided gray's peak. one of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

when i arrived for our first group hike, i learned ""womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than lgbtq+. no issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

the first hike was... awful. it was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. when we got started hiking, it was very slow. one woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. one ate all of her snacks after the first break. lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

after we got back (6 hours later) i pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. she insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that i didn't believe them. when i suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. i gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd hike went even worse. i had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. so i called the head and told her that i thought it was best if i refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that i am fatphobic, i'm mocking them, etc.

please, please keep in mind that i have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. i consider myself to be very patient. one of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

i refunded the money and ended contact only to find my social media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. you can guess what i was called. i felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me i was an asshole for not powering through, that i should have given them three chances, that i should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

"for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him ""uncomfortable""?. using a throwaway. some context; i live in ca, and my wife's niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. she's 22, i've known her since she was 4. her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. she's very sheltered by her mother. anyway, i told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. she's a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

but then my wife goes, ""and she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he's 47.""

i'm 41, my wife is 42. i was like ""you're kidding, right?""

she wasn't kidding. at first, i was like ""hell no."" but after about a week of talking, i gave in....with one caveat. i told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, i'm going to ask some questions he might not like. she wanted to know what kind of questions, and i gave her some.

1. how did you guys meet and who made the first move? (if the dude made the first move, it's weird).

2. has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. are you (the dude) aware of the young woman's history with her father? 

5. what's the end game here? a serious relationship, marriage? have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

i know, i'm not the girl's father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

so, fast forward to the visit. niece and old dude show up. i'm cordial. i wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and i invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. just me and him. then i start asking my questions. 

after only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. he told me this is ""none of my business."" i got a little pissed at that. 

i told him he's staying in my home for a week, i can ask him a few questions. and the girl is my niece, i'm not out of bounds here. he told me i was making him ""uncomfortable"". i replied that i'm uncomfortable having a dude who's clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. i said you can answer my questions and act like you're a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

well, he left. my wife and niece were upset with me. they said i acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. again, i was told it's none of my business. they have since broken up, which i am glad about. not sure if my actions were the cause.

so am i an asshole for questioning this guy?

edit: some info:

i asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got ""uncomfortable"".

i would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

when i took the old dude outside for a beer, i neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. we discussed the new star wars movies of all things.

i would love to discuss more with some of you, but i was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. so it goes.

edit 2: some of you here asked what's up with my wife and her sister. her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. they're wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

final edit: some of you wondered if i would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and i wouldn't have a problem. 

talked to my niece this morning. she and i are totally fine. knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. i apologized for my actions regardless. 

asked why they broke up.

the guy was cheating on his wife. he confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. has three kids. all her age or older. she dumped him.",3
"for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?. my sister is 16 and heavily overweight. she's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. she's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! i'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the edm and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely hated it all. the other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

as a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago i decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. for breakfast i made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. i make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. i mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. i have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

it was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. she started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where i told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (she thinks apple pie is healthy???) my mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but i really think i was making an honest effort to help? i feel bad for yelling at my mom but i dunno, was i really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**edit:** i really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. i just want to emphasize that i'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, i just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. i will try to be more self-informed in the future. i've taken note of her possibly having arfid, thyroid problems, or pcos and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, i feel bad that i've made such a horrible impression of her. she has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, i made a comment on this post detailing how i did the cheese sauce and stuff. thank you very much for your suggestions, i really appreciate them.

"for exposing the real reason my sister and her bf broke up.. throwaway, and i will be keeping this is anonymous as i can, every name will be fake. 

my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, i'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. i assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if i knew the reason they broke up. i said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, i was shocked and apologized to him. 

the next day i was scrolling through facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. 

with jon's permission i posted all the screenshots on my facebook page. 
 it caused my parents to call me and tell me i have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, i've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that i'm now ruining my sisters life.

"for catfishing my underaged sister on tinder and humiliating her in order to teach her a lesson?. last week, i was using my sister ashley's phone because mine was dead and i needed to call a friend to confirm plans. dialing my friend's number, i saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. immediately, i asked why she's on tinder (she's 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said ""none of your business"" 

i decided that i wanted to have a little fun with this. i wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she's just swiping for fun?) so i didn't want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. to test if she was just using for fun, i decided i was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. i asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) kevin if he'd mind if i used his pictures and explained the situation. he thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

i created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister's account. her age was set to 19 (lie, she's still in **high school**) so i was definitely more suspicious of her now. i superliked and less than an hour later, she matched and messaged me. 

i decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for sunday afternoon and told her we could ""head to my place afterwards"". she was completely receptive and said she'd meet me there. she told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

after she left, i told our parents everything and showed them all of the messages. they were pissed, and i suggested we all go to the restaurant. my dad and i just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for ""jim"". my dad went up to her and said ""jim's not coming"" and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. i told her that there was no jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. my dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger's* place. we were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

i told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said i was a ""fucking dick"" and ""cruel"" to her. my other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. wondering who's right and if i went too far?

edit: yes, when i asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would've had sex with jim. that's why i went the extent that i did.

alright after reading all these judgments, i came to the conclusion that i'm ta. but i'm ta she needed. if anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.

"for asking for pocket money because ""i am a kid too"". i am 19f, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. i am still studying so i cannot pay rent yet, but i do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


my father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. they have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. that plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. i had been arranged to join the kids' group, when i tried to protest they insist that i am a ""kid"" too, so i just had to submit to my fate. clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


so i spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. that includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to science park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. to be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when i sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(i admit, i am not really babysitter material). the kids seem to like me, so i guess it went well too. however, i still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


when my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. now, i don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes i can easily earn in a few hours, but i am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, i was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


i put on the biggest smile i and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. they were a little taken aback. i said as sweetly as i could that i deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. in all awkwardness i got my pocket money. needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.


i got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. in their words, i am a major ah to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. aita?",3
"for propositioning a girl in the gym?. please hear me out before you judge because while i did say what you're thinking i didn't say it in the way you're thinking.

the gym i go to is very small. not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. this means working out fairly close to people even if you don't mean to. yesterday i (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (one would do a set while the other waited beside them) the girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend ""ugh i hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.""

i shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. i was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so i'm not entirely sure if it's an actual well known exercise) 

the same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf ""look there she goes again, and her forms terrible."" which is possibly true but she pissed me off.

at this point i call her out. i said ""oi, you."" she immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. so i called her out again specifically ""you in the purple top."" 

she turned round and asked what i wanted. the following conversation happens:

me; do you want to fuck me?
her: what?!
me: i said do you want to fuck me?
her: what the fuck is wrong with you?
me: well you keep staring at me, so i'm assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?

she went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. i carried on with my workout and didn't see them again.

when i told my friend what happened, he said i acted like a dick and that as a woman i should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. he also pointed out that i embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. 

my defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn't talk shit if she doesn't want called out on it.

i'll admit that i'm a pretty confrontational person and i could have reacted better but i also think she should mind her own business.",3
"for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into?. title says it all. my friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn't realize gaming could be so expensive. she dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn't even have candy crush on her phone.

so i told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. i reminded her that she enrolled in bjj class when she dated a bjj blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as i write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (thank god the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn't do it).

after dinner one of our other friends told me i shouldn't have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but i think that there was nothing wrong with what i said because i just pointed out facts and i think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

"for yelling at a lady who was looking into my windows to stalk her son?. i'm 19f and live at home with my family. my younger brother 'mike' is 14. he is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. the boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their moms are hella weird. they have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. my mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""i saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""they were in our garden 5 minutes ago i think now they're headed to the skate park"". i think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

one of the moms is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'jake' is there. we once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
now yesterday i was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. jakes mom had called my phone two times but i didn't answer cause she was annoying me. my boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. we were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. it was all nice and peaceful and suddenly i hear a really loud knock. it really made us jump because it was just so sudden. i turn to look and there's jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. i nearly hit the ceiling i was so angry. i go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt i just wanted to ask because i haven't seen jake in almost two hours ect.ect. apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. i really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. i also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

my boyfriend thought i was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other moms are now blowing up her phone. she also thinks i shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  i feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but i feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",3

my 30 something year old neighbours moved in on friday when i wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when i was collecting my mail. she goes ""don't check your mailbox on weekends. they don't deliver on weekends. so don't check it."" (in a rude karen voice, if you know then you know.) already, i know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and i'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so i said ""i know, it's just i've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so i had to check the mailbox."" i don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

she seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. then we both went inside and that was that. about 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking i was held captive in my basement which i don't have, so i explained to them what i had said and they just laughed and left.

"for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto fb who died during the 9/11 attacks?. i lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when twc towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). i had no calls or texts from her, all i hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. this year i suffered a near-death accident. after it, i did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways i decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people i am close with. 

so for this year, i posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my fb. it was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). i wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""i'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who i am. i hope you are proud of me.""

a few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. she asked if i  loved her or if i wanted to get a divorce. she told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my fb. of course i love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so i felt guilty and took down the post. was i out of line here? i genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, i just wanted people to know what a great person my late-gf was.",3
"if i quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? i would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. ex wife as well.. so years and years of backstory here. ex wife has bpd and life with her has been a continuous struggle. we are in the middle of a divorce because while she's lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. but she crossed that line and enough was enough. divorce is bitter and ugly. 

for financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. i implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. the both blew me off and ""yeah yeahed"" me for almost a year. ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. then getting mad at me when i said i had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

i've had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. on a lark i called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in nm. he said i'm hired. i talked to my partner and he'd gladly buy my half of the business. with the 50% id have to give my ex wife i could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. i could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

kids would be cut off. i wouldn't be able to afford any help. they have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. but they'd have to grow up and fast.

would i be the asshole if i do this?",3
"for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when i found out the child wasn't mine?. my ex and i had been together for 2 years.  it was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  i also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually i broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.

a few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  she was practically beaming with glee.  i agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  didn't want my child subjected to that.

the one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  she very happily agreed.  her reaction actually washed away some of the fears i had about her possibly cheating on me.  so she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  we find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped i honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.

this was a week ago.  she moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  she, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how i'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  that i have plenty of room in my home and i should just help her out.  i feel like i've been through the emotional ringer these past months and i've been though every emotion i am capable of feeling.  from realizing i was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly i feel so emotionally raw and sometimes i agree with them.  that maybe i should take her back and just care for the kid.

was i unfair to this unborn child?  am i a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  she cheated on me, but is this a situation that i should suck it up and take care of them anyway?",3
"for thinking people should stop posting self-congratulatory circle jerks here?. i swear, every day there is a top post about ""for saving kittens from a notorious kitten abuser?"" or ""for breaking up with a convicted rapist?""

these are not conflicts. these are not moral dilemmas. i thirst for juicy conflict where i get to reign down mighty judgement upon the poster. i want to question my own moral standings. i'm tired of the limp dick posts where we're supposed to congratulate the poster on being a hero when it's obvious from the title that, no, you're not an asshole, you're just an attention seeking whore for posting it. 

i'm looking at you:

 **if i break up with my girlfriend for stealing tips when we go out to eat?** are you kidding me? are you an asshole for breaking up with someone who steals from people?

 **for threatening to sue my parents for taking out student loans in my name?** this is literally a crime and you want to know if you're an asshole? 

 **for being upset that my fiancee is staying with her ex** they're banging and you want to know if you're an asshole for being upset. seriously? 

 **for wanting my cousin to pay the same amount of rent as me** unless the body of this post details the fact that you are racking up 3/4 the amount of utilities, run a harem out of the apartment, and piss on their clothes, then no, you're not an asshole for expecting them to pay their equal share.

"for laughing my ass off at my wife's expense?. just for context, i am 6'2 and my wife is 4'11. she is insecure about her height and while i try my best to tell her that she is stupendously beautiful the way she is, she got bullied about it pretty bad and it's just an aspect she doesn't like about herself.

with this in mind, we recently went to one of my favorite places to eat. now, this restaurant has a really large counter and my wife is petite, so the cashier couldn't really see her. 
we ordered our food, and were heading out when the cashier held out a giant piece of candy and said 'for your lovely daughter' to me.

"for filling a few faux amazon packages with my dog's shit to teach the two theiving neighborhood kids who have been stealing my packages a lesson?. this has been going on for a few months now, ever since school let out. there are two girls in the neighborhood who are about 8-10 and the oldest about 10-13... i have a video camera outside our apartment and have caught them red-handed. the first package they stole contained puppy pee pads and garbage bags, second package contained a pair of scrubs for work and last week they got a bluetooth speaker.  amazon replaced all my packages and i would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so i decided to fill a few packages with chihuahua shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson. i also taped notes that said "" dear children, stop stealing my shit!"" in the boxes along with the turds. some of the turds are petrified, some were juicy and wet. or am i a diabolical genius?",3
"for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?. my 19-year old daughter vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they've never don't ever see each other besides a few quick weekend visits. moreover, they've only dated for a little more than a year. 

i told her i was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. but i maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

the problem lies when vanessa asked me for money. you see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, i decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn't have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). that combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn't have to work at all during the school year. 

since i gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. i told vanessa that i was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

she now says that she's moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in it). she said that now she's not going to school, she'd rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

i told her i cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. if/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she's married, i'll be happy to contribute the money. but it's not just a free handout.

she's got really mad that i rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. to her credit, her brother and i have a closer relationship (he's always been the studious rule-follower while vanessa was more the troublemaker), but i do love my children equally. i told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiance, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. that if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, i will fully support it financially.

well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. my wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but i told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and i rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and when she has to move back home. i don't want her to think i support this decision.

she told me she sorta saw my point, but she's not going to help me unravel this mess with my vanessa, she's staying out of it. i, on the other hand, think she's acting like a spoiled brat. for sticking to my guns on this?",3
"if i played ""another one bites the dust"" at my brother's wake?. my brother died. he was an incredible, funny guy, i miss him like i lost one of my limbs. maybe it's stupid, but i want people to remember the person he was. my dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very catholic funeral service. he wasn't catholic and wouldn't like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn't know there. he'd think it's way too fancy, way too much. 

he and i had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, i guess). he told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while ""it's raining men"" played in the background...obviously not an option....also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like ""highway to hell"" and ""another one bites the dust."" 

to remember him, i want to bring a speaker and play ""another one bites the dust"" at his wake. i would explain it to the people at the wake and say that i wanted to preserve the person he was. maybe i could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. there will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren't very familiar with him and are catholic, so i've been thinking maybe not. but i really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. i think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

wibta?

edit: i didn't really expect this response, but thank you. my brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. i swear, i almost sense his hand in it. i don't know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

this morning, i talked to my dad about the wake. i suggested, as some of you did, that maybe i could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. i found a violin one that i really liked. my dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and i made. he actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. i hadn't really been thinking about my dad as much as i should have, i thought of him as opposition, i guess he cared way less about the catholic stuff than i thought. 

i also reached out to some of my brother' s friends. some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. we are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we're going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

thanks again.",3
"for telling my daughter 26f that i 55m will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad 50m.. my wife and i divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since i was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. i knew from many stories i've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. this may sound immature but i made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that i was her only father and to not betray me. but i have no control over what she or they do in their home. fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. she has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me i would be the one to do it. even though i know they're very close, i don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. i am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. i got a bit angry and told her i absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy i barely know. she told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that i'm being petty over something that happened years ago. i told her i wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but i won't be there to see it. 

i was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so i wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",3
"for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?. context: so a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called ""jan"". i am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. i'm a tall and lanky male at 6'1 and 155lbs. jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.


recently, we had a watch party at jan's apartment for the michigan football bowl game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. my buddy and i were talking about whether our qb should declare for the draft or return. i said ""i sure hope he comes back, dylan (our backup qb) is still young and is still pretty scrawny."" 

jan has a huge crush on dylan and didn't appreciate that i called him skinny. 

this caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying ""what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you're literally built of twigs?"" ""you would die playing football. tbh i don't think you could even lift a helmet!"" 

at first, i took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. i usually got my leg pulled about my physique but i never took it personally. until she started making it personal.

""look at you, you're like one of those starving african kids on those tv commercials""  (i'm brown but not african)
""that's why dylan is a chick-magnet and my ex dumped you. you look malnourished""

she kept going and now i was beginning to boil. i wasn't even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. but then i snapped.

her: ""go lift some weights. it's okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.""

me: ""if you could tell me what your current diet is, i'm sure i'll put on weight in no time.""

*silence*

her: ""what are you trying to say?""

me: ""i'm saying that if i'm a malnourished african then you could be on the biggest loser. and i'm pretty certain you wouldn't win.""

her: ""no wonder ex didn't want you. go fuck yourself.""

me: ""and no guy wants you. the last dick you got was moby dick. fucking whale.""

at this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.

since this was at jan's place, i figured i should leave (michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). i finished my beer and left. i got a facetime from one of my friends who is jan's roommate. she urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and i went too far. i didn't feel that way and i don't want to apologize.

am i the asshole?

"- i missed my daughter's award ceremony because of my son, she's still not speaking to me. this might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

i've been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. he's not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. he's been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it's helped somewhat.

their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son's main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

my daughter was graduating from college last year. a week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. i was obviously incredibly proud of her. she asked me to come to it and i said i would. 

her college is two hours from here. i hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. right as i was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. i couldn't leave, and he wasn't calm for hours. i'd left my daughter a voicemail saying i wasn't going to be able to make it. 

she called back that night absolutely livid. she called me a shitty mother, said i had two kids but only cared about one, that i'd missed every game and performance she'd had as a child and it clearly wasn't going to change as adults and that she was just done. she said she knows he can't help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. she hung up and that was it. i've barely spoken with her since. she didn't send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. she hasn't shown up for holidays and i've heard she's engaged but didn't call to tell me. she's cut us out, and in the one of three times we've spoken since she said it's easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn't have to bother getting her hopes up i might come now. 

- i've offered family counselling and all other manner of things. i know i wasn't a perfect mom growing up - i didn't make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. i'm heartbroken but i don't think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",3
"for asking my wife to have an abortion. my wife and i (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. we don't have any kids and don't want kids. we had the ""what if"" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.

yesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. she's on the pill, but accidents happen. she said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. naturally, i was surprised by the news and her change of mind. i asked her if she considered getting an abortion. she said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. she told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. i told her i wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. she started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. she wont answer my phone calls.

i'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. i was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. i know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but i can't help but have a negative view about it. a few years ago i tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but i couldn't. i was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. my wife is aware of these points.

i just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. i also don't like kids. my wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows i wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. i understand why she thinks that, but i still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little i would be involved in raising him or her.

for asking my wife to have an abortion?

edit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. if she ever wanted to stop taking it, i would support her 100%. i realize that i'm an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. it honestly never occurred to me until now (i think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). i see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. i'm going to get snipped asap.

edit #2: she and i talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. here are the main takeaways:

* i apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. i also apologized if she felt like i was pressuring her when i asked her to have an abortion. i didn't mean to pressure her, but i know words aren't always received as we intended. she said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows i was totally caught off guard.
* she apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. she said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes i don't feel like she tricked me (i don't).
* we mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. we've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",3
"for not paying for the extra meal i accidentally ordered at a wedding?. my sixteen year old son and i went to a wedding. when we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. there was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but i never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. i sent in the rsvp card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

at the wedding, my son and i got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. the waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. the waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

i later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that i had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. i told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. they said i should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that i should have asked for clarification if i wasn't sure. but i wasn't unsure, i never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. ten and under i would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up i would never think would have a kid's meal. the bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but i've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. i think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. 

if i refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? i know wedding meals are expensive, but i think this was their mistake.",3
"for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after i got rich?. my mom left my dad when i was 17 (i'm 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. we all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. she had 2 more kids with this guy. 

when my mom and dad broke up i moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. the major reason for this was because she told me to leave as i kept fighting with her new dude. i really did not want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and i was really upset that she didn't give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. when she told me to leave...something in me changed and i am still unable to forgive her. that solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. and my sister and mom were close so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

since i was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc i like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. they gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that's much they believed in me) and basically, i majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. the profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, i'm living a life i never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

i moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we've started a new life. i am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and i'm grateful so much bc i was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

for the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. she is getting increasingly more insistent that i go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don't. she keeps telling me that 'even if i don't forgive her i should look out for the kids as they're innocent in all this' 

because day to day i have no interest in helping her or her family? imo she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. i just can't forgive her though.",3
"for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face. my newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. it requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

enter lady with four kids: a newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). she really really should have brought an ipad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. the mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. she was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. ffs at one point when i wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. my newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and i did not feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

i tried being polite about it ""sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""ma'am!"" -points to kid- the lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. rinse and repeat. i told her she needed to stay with her mom. little punk deadass says ""i don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


finally, i'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? why is your baby crying! make him stop! i don't like that"" and her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. so now i'm out formula, kid still screaming, and i have a huge mess that i don't have a great way to clean up. 

i'm at my wits end. i raise my voice at this kid. ""look what you did. i am not your mom, i am not your babysitter. you are bothering me. get out of my face!!"" 

people looked at me like i was the biggest bitch on earth. a lady speaking spanish actually did call me a bitch. the little girl starts crying. i'm not apologizing. the mom confronts me, i tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill i'm prepared to die on.

now it's not like i was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

anyway i never stopped using the toilet bin. 

now i'm back she's started a new thing. moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that i keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when i'm on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

i personally think i absolutely should not be hiding the fact i have a vagina and it bleeds. her boys will grow up thinking it's gross and something that needs to be hidden. i would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. and i just want to be comfortable in the house i'm living in.

edit: for more info, this isn't a random house i've moved back into. i've lived here since i was 3 before my parents got divorced when i was 7. my step mum and her kids moved in when i was 12(ish). i moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. 

so this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more.",3
"for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?. my former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. as a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so i was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. she (now laura) has not started hrt yet but is living fulltime as a woman. laura and i no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

ever since i moved out and laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. she's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

i am fine with what laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

i tried to talk about this privately to laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. my son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. the moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. people were obviously listening and when i gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because i was jealous of her confidence. to make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that i was a piece of shit for saying what i was. my son and i left in tears but laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

ever since then i've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and i was a bad person for asking laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. i'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if i've gotten old and out of touch. it just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this. for speaking to my ex this way?",3
"for being cold to my ex-fiance and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?. so, right now i'm in kinda a shitty situation. i've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. all of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but i don't feel that way, heres the story.

i knew my ex for almost 10 years. we go back all the way to high school and have been friends. after we graduated i said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. we dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. i won't lie, i loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. she, however, seemed super worried. i sat down and talked with her about it. i told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy i would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. she was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

these past 7 months have been a roller coaster. she moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. that was until a few weeks ago. an old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. i was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. this guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. it turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. he is not lying about this. he sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. i was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. along with this, he sent me a string of facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because i make more money that the real father and she would rather i care for it.

suffice to say, i was fucking pissed. i confronted her, she cried, i cried, it was a mess. in the end i broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. she's in the process of moving out now but i have not said a single word to her. i have pretty much told her that i want her out of my life. i also demanded a dna test the minute the child is born. if it is mine, i'll help her support it. if not, then i am never seeing her again.

i've been cold to her. her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but i've refused any contact with them. at one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and i kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. any time she's tried to ""reconcile"" i've shut it down,

my friends are saying i'm in wrong here. according to them she's pregnant and because of that i should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. i disagree fully. but i could be wrong. am i letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",3
"aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why i have missing fingers?. i have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. it's fine. i can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days i can't, that's the dyspraxia). however, i won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. i only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

i'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but i still find it annoying. i really don't get why you'd think it would be an ok thing to ask someone about, but hey. i wasn't raised in a barn. usually i nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

anyway, i started a new job about a month ago, and i honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. i felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and i decided to make myself laugh. when the first new coworker asked about it, i completely lied and told her that i chewed them off as a baby. i then decided to tell the next person who asked that i cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that i was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. all genuinely ridiculous reasons but i'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. i didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. maybe they just thought there's no way i'd lie about how i lost my fingers.

within about 3 days, i learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. i'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3d printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

anyway, i told this story to my brother today and he told me that i was an asshole because i caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. my argument is that i'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because i didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, i was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think i actually severed three fingers with dental floss when i was 3. i'll accept my judgement, though.

update: gonna check out here, i think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. a few reminders for people: i'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",3
"for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?. necessary information: when my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. after a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

that was when my husband and i stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. when she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and i still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200b;

now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. he's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. my daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. since i'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. i asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. i asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. i also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200b;

he thought of asking me because i had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". i told him that no, it was not. i was 42 then and i'm 59 now, i didn't had the health issues that i do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  i would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. now he thinks i'm playing favorites and that i'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but i think i'm just being reasonable.

&#x200b;

edit: while it is nice to know that i'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". i disagree as it was not my intent and i never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. he's also very mad about being called an asshole. while he is my son, i find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. i'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",3
"for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)

   i've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. you can skip to the tl;dr if the exposition is too long.

she's a self-proclaimed ""foodie"", which i honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. she can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. 

if you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' when someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.

(it doesn't stop there, she knew i had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as i walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. it's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)

that's not it, either. she *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, bam, i'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. 

it's gotten to the point where i don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, i've saved up more being with her than i ever had in any other relationship. the only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.

our anniversary was recently, and i had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so i suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, ""i'm not learning how to make sushi because then i'll *never* get a real date ever again."" we ended up going out instead.

it kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. she's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like olive garden ""because she likes the red sauce"" or other places because she likes the food, and now that i'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because i've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.

she also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste i've ever seen so i kinda think it's just an excuse.

i just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.

tl;dr: so, reddit, am i the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because i practically have a private chef of my very own?

edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, i just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.

edit 2: i'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. i'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick

edit3: no, twitter, i don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. i buy her herbs and succulents. what flowers do i buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?

also, yes, i wash the dishes

#final edit:

okay guys. this will probably be my last edit. this post exploded unexpectedly and i've tried to respond to as many comments as i can, but there's just too many of you. if you've asked me a direct question and i haven't answered, i'm sorry. my inbox is a mess.

i really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and i can honestly say that i've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. it's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.

so her mom picked up the girls and i took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. she was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and i apologized for being stupid. after, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so i asked her to marry me.

she said no. she did it kindly, but she still said no. she said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. 

i'm pretty heartbroken. i thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.

so, reddit, you were all right. i'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.

"for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food?. i'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. i've lived there for 6 years. my neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (i actually don't know her first name but i'll call her katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. we exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

so i don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, i don't have as much money for takeout anymore. i'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. i'm gaining weight and i never feel great.

this is where katie comes in. i can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (i know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). i've even complimented it a few times. so i got the idea that i'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or i can pick it up from her!) at night. she's cooking anyway and then i'd have varied presumably delicious food.

i asked her the next time i saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). the next time i saw her a few days later, i asked her if she was sure and upped the amount i was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and i should get a housekeeper if that's what i want. she also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like i was being creepy (i wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). i think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

so, aita?

edit: people keep assuming i'm sexist because i didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. it's not an assumption for me. he and i have lived across from each other for 6 years. the cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and i've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

edit: okay. it is abundantly clear that i was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as i hate to admit it, creepy. my instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, i'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. thanks.",3
"for suggesting that the reason my female friends dislike my housemate is because he's not sexually interested in them?. i (23m) live in a house share with 6 others. 2 other guys and 3 girls, we're all the same age.

now one of the housemates, we'll call cliff (23m). i call him cliff because he reminds me heavily of brad pitt's character in once upon a time in hollywood. cliff is a very good looking guy, he's friendly and pretty much the poster boy for ""strong silent type"". he doesn't talk much and is mysterious, but he's also very confident. 

the thing is, we don't see that much of him. but whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house. like a different girl each week. he occasionally comes to the parties we host in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him. 

now the three girls i live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls in the club and got with them instead.  since that day, these 3 girls have made catty remarks about him.

when we're in the kitchen (when cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. they were doing it yesterday so i just chimed in and said ""are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...i saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

i told cliff what they said and he just looked at me and laughed, and then said ""don't concern yourself with what they say. they're childish"". so i dunno...aita?",3
"for ruining jeans for women?. i work at an office where i'm allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the ""no jeans policy."" she frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

problem is, for the past few months that i've been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. that is, until a few days ago. 

i love wearing jeans, and have always felt i could make them professional too. i was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. she said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

i said ""well, the girls get to wear jeans.""

""no they don't.""

then, my coworker, amanda walked in wearing jeans. i pointed that out. my manager confronted amanda, telling her that she wasn't allowed to wear jeans. 

in the moment, amanda appeared playfully mad at me. but i went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but i think she may actually be mad. i apologized, saying i didn't want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

aita?

edit/ update: wow, did not expect all of the responses, though i can't say i'm surprised about the polarization. at work today, it wasn't bad. only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. i do feel bad that i ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day i will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",3

"meta at any point, the advice you're reading could be coming from someone too young to sign up for social media without parental permissions.. this seems like a really weird meta post, but i just wanted to warn people that captain sparklez, a youtuber with a high child/teenager viewer base, spent almost a whole trails episode talking about this sub. it's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.

it seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. the thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

this isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. honestly i knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds i know to this day. but it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

i *am* the asshole, i already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. sorry, teenagers, but i kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. i wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but i would also be looking at their advice differently if i knew their lack of life experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️

just be careful everyone. and please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. this doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind ""sub dedicated to helping others"" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than ""sub dedicated to calling other people assholes."" i just don't want to see lives ruined over this sub.",3
"for not helping an obese woman get up after she refused my help the first time?. i was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. at a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

as i was near, i rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

when she saw me coming near her she said "" don't touch me i'm fine "", in a really agressive angry voice. 

i said ok, i just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied "" i dont need your help"", again super angry. 

i wasn't the only one that got up and got closer to her, but i was the first one, cause i was sitting right by the restroom

cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

she couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. so another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

the barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if i could help and i said "" i was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, i'm good"".

i kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

they all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

am i the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

"for telling my wife that if she quits her job i expect her to cover all the housework?. my wife wants to quit her job. she wants to be a sahm to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.


in order for her to do that, i would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on saturdays. i told her that i if she quits her job then i expect her to cover all the housework. i may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. i will will help out on weekends but during weekdays i rather rest. 


my wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and i am being lazy and discriminative against women. i don't really mean that, as i think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. i will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. aita?


edit: i admit that i did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because i was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. ofcourse, i also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.",3

"if i report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to hr for basically slut shaming me?. i've \f21\ recently encountered a new sexual partner. we used a condom, but after words i felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time i have ever hooked up with someone i just met. my previous sexual partners have all been someone i have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. while condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a sti, it cannot provide absolute protection. a few days ago, i noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an std. i have never had one before and i have no idea the symptoms, but an std was all i could think about. 


i went to an urgent care because i wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or uti) and if not, i wanted to send my urine off for an std screening.  my doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which i was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


it came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. she says based on my symptoms, i am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and std screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


as i'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" i sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""with all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". i looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". at this point, i was pretty fucking angry. you could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. i thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

i was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn i get slut shamed for it? i posted this in a forum about sexual education and i was getting advice to report her to hr. i don't want to go after anybody's job, but i don't want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

will i be the asshole if i report her to hr or should i leave it alone?

edit: for everybody asking, i was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. i just kind of stared at her because i immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information i shared with her so openly. so after a couple of seconds she said ""i appreciate your openness and honesty tho"" (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so i just said ""thanks"" and left. i was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. trust me, i wish i would have but i wasn't even thinking about going off on her. i was just embarrassed. 

also, she was a nurse practitioner. i know a couple of times i referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was np. 

and for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that i'm having more fun than u 😘


update

before i start off with the update, i want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) i am not heartless, and in the original post i even directly said i did not want to go for her job. that was never my intention and i even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you're obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. i also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody i just met, so ""closing my legs"" or ""quit being easy"" doesn't fucking apply. in game if thrones, every single ""whore"" had one thing in common and that's that they enjoyed sex. so if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) for teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. what you decide to do with your body is really nobody's business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

now to the update: 
i called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or np supervisor. they didn't have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the nps was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

first and foremost, i explained to the manager that i in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. i did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or pip to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

i explained to her everything that happened and before i could even say who the np was, she knew exactly who i was talking about...which confirmed that she's most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

i then explained how i confided in her and that i came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. i explained that her words didn't hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers and future interactions with her other women patients. 

the lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she'd ""call the doctor (her supervisor)"" right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. she also said she was placing a note and that the np wouldn't be back in the office until next monday. 

with all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! you've truly been so helpful. 

and for the people calling me a slut for this, i hope to god this same thing doesn't happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",3
"for not letting my kids go on vacation with my ex because it's my time with them.. so right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because i won't give up my appointed time with them. my son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. 

&#x200b;

a little backstory. me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. i blame him for it and he blames me. i won't go into detail here. we ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. while this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. we rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. one thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. and unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. in the 8 years since we've been divorced i have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and i've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200b;

well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. his parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at disneyland and he want's to take the kids. well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. he asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and i shot him down. it's my week with them and i get to spend it with them. i told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that i need to ""think of them"". i told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200b;

well, this last sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. when i asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. when i asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to disneyland"". asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them i was not letting them go to disneyland with him. he's trying to paint me as the bad guy. i sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. my daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200b;

i'm not though. i think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. i demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"". 

&#x200b;

i'm so pissed right now. am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during my time with my kids? how is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",3
"for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last name?. my teacher doesn't like my first name and always talks about how weird it is, and how my last name should be my first. so she took it upon herself to only refer to me by my last name, on tests she'd even cross out my first name when i wrote it. i kept telling her i preferred being called by my first name, but she laughed it off. so i started calling her by her first name, the first time she was shocked but after a month she just kept yelling to me how i was being really disrespectful. i've gotten numerous detentions because of it, but i don't want to stop until she calls me my first name. so if i keep calling her by her first name.

edit for more information: i have an arabic name and live in a country where majority of people are arabs. i should also clarify that in my country we already call teachers by their first name (ex: mrs. name) however i stopped addressing the mrs and only call her by her name. the country i live in isn't very well, and school systems are upside which is why it may be different then everyone else's.",3
"for telling my mom she's a whore?. throwaway. long time lurker, first time posting. 

i am the oldest daughter of 4 children. i'm currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

when i was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. i, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

this has put a strain on my mothers and i's relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
she didn't even try to keep it a secret from the kids, i remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and i'd see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. as a kid i didn't understand, but as i got older i realized what she was doing in front of us and i feel sick. 

people ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this ""family friend"". they split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

i've confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. this was roughly 3 years ago. 

my mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. they exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. i read the messages and it's very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she's just catching up with an old co worker. but i know my mother, and i know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. i mean it's been years, why else would you want to catch up?

my new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn't agree with it, it's been years, he wasn't in her life yet.

she asked me what i thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. she asked for my honest opinion about the matter and i told her; 

""to be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy's marriage and you guys had 4 kids. idk why you think it wouldn't ruin this one, but why don't you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?""

she cried, said she couldn't believe i just called her a whore and left my house. we haven't spoken for a few days.

today, i got a call from my siblings saying i hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy's marriage was between them. i disagree, i had to witness my mom cheating on my father, i watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. she asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she's selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? sorry i'm not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",3
"for refusing to share my extra income with my wife when she didn't share hers with me when she earned more?. when my wife \32f\ and i \32m\ got married eighht years ago, she made about 15k more per year than i did. our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted. my wife was the one who insisted on this, and although i was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), i agreed since she felt strongly about it.

&#x200b;

a few years after we married i decided to go to law school. long story short, i ended up at a big law firm and now earn about four times what my wife does. since i managed not to go into debt, i have a good bit of money left over after i make my contributions to our joint expenses.

&#x200b;

my wife  asked me to reconsider this arrangement (she doesn't feel like its fair that i get to buy most of the things i want while she is on a much more limited budget), and i told her i would not reconsider it since this is what she wanted originally. i think fair is fair since this was her idea, but i do wonder if  i am wrong for refusing to reconsider our financial arrangement?

"for lying to my boyfriend about when an event starts?. so this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so i figured i would bring it to the group to see if i'm the asshole or not.

my boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  i absolutely hate it because i am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.

for an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  we live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  we were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.

a few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, i told my boyfriend that the event started at noon, not 1:00.  and just as i figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  we show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.

so last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  i had lied about what time the event started.  i know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if i can lie about something like that, whose to say what else i'd be lying about.  i told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that i don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if i'm 'hiding something'.  i explained that i only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  in my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.

he doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one i lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).

i've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but i just have to know if i'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.


edit:  so i posted this before i left for work when there was only a handful of comments and wasnt able to check it all day.  i certainly didn't expect it to get this much attention, let alone 20,000 upvotes.

though i haven't yet gotten a chance to read through or reply to any messages or comments yet, i'd like to thank everyone for their judgements.  whether you think i'm an asshole or not, you took time out of your life to try to explain your point of view of the situation and i appreciate that.",3
"if i record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?. my neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the tv. i've gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. we have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. they also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. it's actually turning me off sex. i find them insufferable. 

 as petty revenge, i'm considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they're loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. i feel they know i'm mild-mannered, and they're taking advantage - that since i'm not a tough guy or something (i'm a young woman), they don't care. 

i'm in australia, and i'm pretty sure that kind of recording is legal here.

"for telling a stranger to delete a picture of me and my seizure alert dog that he took of me on the bus even after he told me why?. heya. 

so this happened a few days ago, and i'm still pretty worried about whether i'm an asshole or not. 

i take the bus to and from work and it's quite a long commute. background: 

 i have epilepsy. i have a seizure alert dog, and he comes with me on the bus. because hes trained to do all kinds of support tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). 

ive had a lot of seizures on the bus, so i have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day. to accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, i sit in the disability seating section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the way. 

now onto the story: 

i'm on the bus ride home, and i found a seat in the disability section. i was about 2 stops from my home, and  i was starting to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. the next thing i know, i see a flash. 

i look up, and a man sitting near me was holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. i was in a bit of a rough state, so i asked him to delete it. i was probably firmer than i usually would be, but my dog was alerting me and i had about 10-15 mins to get home. 

the man was stuttering and saying things like ""i just wanted a picture he was being so cute and i saw his id badge (he has one attached to his vest that says ""seizure alert dog"")."" i asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes ""my daughter has epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog"" 

i told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that he deleted it. 

i was then at my stop and ran home.

i felt bad, because i do epilepsy activism work so i felt for him but i was really uncomfortable with someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section just felt wrong. 

should i have just let him keep the picture? aita?

edit to clear up some things: 

-i dont care about legality, just the asshole nature of the situation
-i'm a female :) 
-i live in canada
-while i dont have exclusive photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse 
-if he had asked me, i would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. hes super cute so i get it.

"for correcting every single sentence spoken by my boyfriend's aunt in front of everyone?. i know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! 
i'm a native french speaker from canada, but i have a very pronounced ""acadian/chiac"" accent. for those who don't know, it's pretty much a mix of french and english with some local dialect thrown in there. pretty common in the maritimes, where i still live. i'm perfectly bilingual in both languages.

i started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks english, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they've all been really great, except for one of his aunts. she says she was a french teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in france, and she insists on only talking to me in french. i agreed at first since i didn't want to be rude to his family but it's getting super weird. i don't understand how she was able to teach kids english or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like i have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope i'm right because it makes absolutely no sense. (example: she said ""a la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche"" which roughly translates to ""to the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth"" when she meant ""this pumpkin pie tastes delicious"") 
she constantly criticizes my ""accent"".  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me i need to ""pick a language"" when i accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper ""français standard"" is actually getting harder for me since i've been only studying/working in english). 

so last night during dinner she started going on about how acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total bs, and obviously weirdly directed at me. for the rest of the night i stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like i didn't understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. i wasn't trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the french and ignored me for the rest of the night.  
turns out she was super pissed and told everyone i was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. looking back i think i might've taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and i feel bad. my boyfriend said i was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. here?


edit: forgot to mention that i told her a few years ago that it's hard for me to fully speak proper french as i spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain acadian culture (she wasn't having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again.",3
"for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?. my daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. she has been begging for a nintendo switch. due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a switch. money isn't the issue... it's her behavior; she acts very entitled & she's lying left & right. i just don't feel now is the right time for a switch.

the theft: 

on easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband's aunt & uncle's house. aunt & uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we'll call her cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. she lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn't get many upscale things unless they are a gift. well, cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. she eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.

well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.

my kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. she snuck it out of aunt & uncle's by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. she proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when aunt & uncle called & asked if we had seen where cousin might have left it.

due to cousin's challenges, she was utterly distraught over her missing gameboy. it's one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.

i'm disappointed about the thievery, but i'm even more upset over my kid's attitude about being caught. i only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. it wasn't until i sat there & thought about it that i knew she was lying to me. once i told her i knew it had to be her because of xyz did she finally confess. her behavior only got worse from there. she refused to apologize when uncle & cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like she was the one being wronged. 

i feel like i need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing is not ok. i think that purchasing the switch (with my daughter's help from money she would ""earn"" by doing extra chores) & having her give it to cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.

i mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... birthday... i don't really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. what do you think reddit?

edit: thank you all for the replies. i just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. 

also - i do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. not sure how or when, since i have a so to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.



***edit: i'll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying i'm ta for being a lazy parent. our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and i. my husband and i are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. he and his family hardly ever tell her ""no"" to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. i assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",3
"update - for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. a few months ago, i posted this post( https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/achoyx/aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting_to_go_to/) asking if i was an asshole for not wanting to take my girlfriend out to restaurants. it blew up. it ended up on twitter. people shared it to facebook.

the general consensus was, yes, that i am the asshole, and it just went downhill from there. a couple people told me to kill myself, so thanks for that. more than a couple people told me that they hoped my girlfriend broke up with me. 

well.

after i posted - and proposed and was rejected - things got pretty awkward between us for the first time in five years. she started to get snappy at me easily, she stopped being as affectionate to me, she started making pretty much nothing but casserole. everything changed - to clarify, she usually liked to make more involved food than casserole.

then one day, like three weeks ago, she threw down the spoon she was using to serve the thousandth casserole this month, and snipped at me, ""do you seriously fucking think that i *actually like* eating at olive garden?""

guys, she saw the post. she was *furious*. 

she doesn't like olive garden - she'll eat there because the kids love it and it's cheap. i was right about the red sauce being non-acidic, but, well, in her words, ""she never developed a taste for pasta, she's latino, do i ever see her make pasta? no. a meal isn't complete without rice. you don't know me at all.""

she yelled about olive garden for a solid twenty minutes. it wasn't just about olive garden, but it was a lot about olive garden.

long story short, we've been separated for a few weeks now, and it's not looking good. she ""loves and respects me but feels it's best for her to respectfully disengage"" from me for her own personal betterment.

 so, yeah.

tl;dr: i ruined my family by not appreciating my girlfriend. i didn't take her out on dates and i didn't pay enough attention. i would do anything to fix everything.

edit: to clarify a few things

1. i didn't post on april first.

2. i say that she yelled about ""mostly olive garden"" because she did. she was really embarrassed that a bunch of people on the internet were making fun of her over olive garden, where the kids are catered to.

3. she did not call herself latino. she calls herself latinx, but i thought latino would be less confusing. guess it just made me look like a dick.",3
"for being mad my girlfriend took my keys?. my lovely girlfriend and i have been together for 8 months. she slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

my issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student id to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

i asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my id on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. i told her that i didn't appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. we started to fight about it and i ended up asking her to leave.

since then, she hasn't answered any of my texts or calls. when i told my roommate about this he said that i was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and i yelled at her about it. i think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. aita?

edit: i thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, i get that she was being nice but why couldn't she have asked??

edit 2: and no she still hasn't responded to me

edit: i'm at work now obsessing but i know that i screwed up. i had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess i'm projecting or something. and no, my girlfriend hasn't responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money i tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it's early in my time zone

final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. i brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. we had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  she chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.

also, i am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",3
"for telling my roommate that guys who go to porn conventions are losers?. i (26m) and roommates with (30m). let's call him mark. mark told me that he is considering to buy ticketed to a porn convention and my first reaction was to laugh. he asked why i laughed so i just explained.

i said that i can understand people who are in the industry who go, so men/women looking to further their career. but the dudes who go as fans that aren't in the industry are just weirdos and losers. i've seen videos/pics and they look just as you'd expect them to.

i'm currently planning my mother's funeral on behalf of my siblings (they live overseas and are not here yet). my mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. in particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.

this women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. they have a long long history of bad blood between each other. both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. obviously i think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.

anyway even though i really dislike this women, i have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. she's my father's wife and 2. she was close friends with my mom. my wife was livid at finding out about this and insists i put my foot down and not let her attend the service.

so for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. i keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. i try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and i wont hold it against her. she refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.

so a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and i lose my tempter. i tell her (paraphrasing)

""just shut up already. you don't get a day in this. you don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for christs sake. just leave me alone already.""

i did not say it calmly. i yelled it and was definitely angry because i'm busy organising my mother's funeral. she has gone off crying and i'm left wondering if i went too far.

i can't deal with this nonsense and i'm just going to accept whatever judgement is given and go with that.",3
"for not letting a friend use my umbrella in a japanese downpour?. my friends and i went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.

i warned them multiple times that if it rains, i would not let them borrow my umbrella.

one friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. i reminded them that i would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

roughly an hour later, it started raining. hard. it was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. i stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). when we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. neither were particularly happy.

for standing by my word and not saving my friend from the rain?",3
"for not allowing my niece to use ""promised"" money from my grandma's estate to go to college? my family is derisively calling me ""scott's tots"" in order to get me to bend and give in, and it's sort of working.. edit: for all the people asking, scott's tots is an episode of the the office, the plot is michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. he assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. the episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. i've seen it called the ""best unwatchable episode of tv ever"" because it's so cringe worthy. i've watched the office 8 times and i skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. parks n' rec is a better show though...fight me. 

so how do i begin with this. i am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. my grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who i call niece because i truly don't understand all the ""removed"" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. the condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise i would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. the stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (i really hope this is making sense). basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do i get to keep it long term. 

my cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to university of arizona so she can start next week. either they didn't know or didn't care about the gpa requirement because when i asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. i don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 gpa. i asked her how she got into uofa and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. 

i basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my grandma's will and that i will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  

that's when all hell broke loose. my mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. my sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that i'm running my own version of ""scott's tots"" because i taking away money that was promised for education. there's also an undertone that i'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so i can save it for myself if they don't go to college. 

no amount of explanation is helping. i've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can i keep their shares. if they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. no one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and i imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). 

there is really nothing stopping me from doing it. i write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what i'm doing. 

i have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the scott's tots thing because i don't want to be seen like that. 

would i be the asshole if i withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?

edit: just for my own notes since i'm saving this thread and i guess if might help other people be clear.

cousin a (nieces mom), 38: paid.

cousin/sister  j, 32: paid.

me: paid 

cousin b, 25: not paid.

cousin j2, 20: in school.

niece k, 18: not paid (subject of post).

a, b and k are the ones causing all the issues and calling me 30 times a day.",3
"update: for not agreeing to house my pregnant teenage sister and her delinquent boyfriend after our parents disowned her?. og post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cvzd4t/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_house_my_pregnant/)

it's been a little bit more than two weeks since my first post and i guess it's safe to say now that the situation has been resolved in probably the best way possible!!

in my last post, i stated that my sister was still living in the car of her delinquent boyfriend who sells drugs and refusing to come home because my parents had disowned her. at this point, i would like to clarify that my family and i are chinese and it is common in chinese culture to ""disown"" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. however, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. his business was a passion project on the side. my dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)

alrighty, onto what ultimately happened with my sister. despite the chain of advice i sent her, she ignored me still. i regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. i was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then i received a call from my parents!!! according to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. she had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. my mom was very tearful as well. they scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and i believe she went in the next day.

i had no idea what made her finally break and return home so i texted her (first, i told her i was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. at first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*. lmao. what a fucking asshole. glad my sister finally returned to her senses. she told me she broke it off with him and i sincerely hope that's the truth.

this past monday, she got the pills to successfully terminate her pregnancy. according to my mom, she was begging that they do is asap, which was really a breath of relief for all of us because we were worried she might want to keep it.

the future seems pretty bright right now for her. my parents decided to pull her out of the public school and send her to a progressive private school that some of my close friends also went to (it's a fantastic school and i think it'd be great for her). she's officially starting next monday. i'm going to visit her and my family this weekend and see how she's doing. :)

tl;dr: sis returned home safely and apologized to parents. delinquent bf was forcing her to sell drugs for him in repayment for the hospitality that he has provided her in the form of the backseat of his car and mcdonald's. sis terminated the pregnancy and will be attending a new school next week.

edit: forgot to add that the new school also has a wonderful counseling department. i urged my parents to speak to the head psychologist there and they did and she will be having mandatory weekly meetings with her and another therapist at the school. :)",3
"for intentionally posting the wrong test answers on a cheating website?. backstory:

i failed my first 400-level  physical chemistry test 2 months ago. i barely passed my second one last month.i noticed i scored significantly below class average on both and the curve wasn't quite what i expected it to be. (that's ok, labs + hw keep my grade at a high b)

side note: the class is about 60 people. unbeknownst to me, it fills up quickly every semester because people think the professor is 'easy'. i didn't know this. the class just fit my schedule and i certainly didn't think it was 'easy' after those 2 exams.

here's the catch: our professor is old and i noticed during exams that many people were suspiciously using their phones. i heard rumors that someone had posted the test questions to a relatively well-known site (it will remain unnamed)  and some students had used that to score a's and b's. (we can't really use the site for homework help because of our homework structure, but a lot of us use it for test review & test prep, which is extremely helpful). our tests are long -we get 2 and a half hours for each test- which gives these students plenty of time to post the questions and receive the answers online. 

exam day:

i was extremely irritated when i heard this. this rage really fueled me and i over-prepared for test 3. i studied like crazy  for it because i felt like these cheating students were robbing me of points from a regular curve. i was able to finish the test in about 45 mins of the given time. i didn't know everything, but i felt pretty great about what i turned in.  i was the second student done with the exam and felt pretty good as i wrapped it up. 

once i finished and began walking out, i looked around and saw a ton of people cheating. i was so angry and so distraught, that i used my free time after the test to go on the site and see if my peers had posted the test questions. of course they had. i had memorized all of the questions (there was only 6) and found 4 of the questions had been posted online.  i answered all of them incorrectly, though i made the process look somewhat legitimate. i realized that if i answered those questions first, the real site tutors wouldn't answer them in the given time (i was right). 

present day:

i scored a high b, and the curve put my grade at an a. 

i had the fourth-highest score on the exam.

most students failed, even though i found this test to be much easier and much more manageable than the previous two. i looked at the tests of my peers as we compared results. we always compare the partial-credit points to make sure our grades are fair. i saw that a lot of them (i'd estimate about 13-15 students based on what i saw ) used the ""fake"" methods i had used on those incorrect answers.  more students failed this test than the second test, and it was pretty evident that i'd screwed some of the cheating students. 

i honestly can't say i feel bad about what i did. i worked hard, and their lazy efforts directly impacted my gpa and my future. 

edit: 
a common argument i see here is ""see you studied and did better! just keep doing that!"" 
i studied like a maniac. i didn't go out, didn't attend meetings, just had total focus on this one test. it's a completely unsustainable level of study and was only possible because i didn't have much going on in my other classes.",3
"for withholding from my children that my husband had a wife and child before he met me? they've just found out and are acting like i've betrayed them.. my children are 17 and 14 respectively, and i'm hoping the fact that they're teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. 

my husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. no one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. 

i had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. it was at an aa meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the us. 

i have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. i like to joke that i'm keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. i've had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- i am so damaged that i just feel lucky that i got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. 

we had two children- two sons. we'd never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it's a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. 
he has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. 

my mother in law told the kids this sunday gone, as she decided it was 'time for them to know'. she didn't consult us before telling them, and certainly didn't do it in our presence. 

since then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they've been prodding their dad asking why we'd never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they're acting like we've kept a secret affair family from them or something. 

my 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. i broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing i'd ever heard him say. i asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. 

he told me that it made 'so much sense' why we were abnormal, why we don't drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. 

the two are pretty heartbroken, and i feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children's lives as a result of us staying quiet. i am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and i don't know how to proceed. i have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news.",3
"for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?. so i'm 17 and i used to be morbidly obese. i was actually morbidly obese until last year when i decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. i'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and i feel really great. i went from 130kg to 70kg and i'm 5ft 9

anyways my sister eats horribly. she is morbidly obese. my parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

anyways i saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. the sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. my mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. it's absolutely insane i think and there was nice coke can to go with it. i told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. i offered her a piece of tofu in which i was having for lunch. tofu is actually delicious. more people should try it.

 she told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that i'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when i was a child(i wish someone did). apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. my mother said i wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

was i in the wrong?",3
"for not shaving my legs for work?. so i'm a 21 year old female. i feel like i should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out i rarely shave my legs. i'm straight, i'm very feminine, and i just don't like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. also i'm not a hairy person at all! you can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. the only time i shave is when i'm dating a new guy in my life and i've been with my current bf for 3 years now. also he doesn't give a rats ass if i shave my legs. 

so i work for a promotion company where i travel and work at event and festivals. but today i had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so i stoped to say hi before i left out. 

when i ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. i said sure and came in and he shut the door. he was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. i was in literal shock. i was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. my boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained i didn't shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that i wasn't being hygienic. i was even more shocked. 

i told him i didn't understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. i asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. i then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this i'd prefer hr to be there and he just told me that we didn't need to discuss it any further. 

later today i just got an email from hr saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. i'm freaking out and it's making me so anxious.
for not shaving my legs for my job?

edit: so people giving my boss hate i understand but i'm not mad at him and don't blame him. im not sure but i feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn't even force dress code and stuff. but also i really have no clue what really brought this on all of a sudden since i've worked there 8 months with no incident.",3
"for ""tattling"" on my boyfriend to his mother. my boyfriend and i have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.

since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. he'll sit on the couch and play video games and he'll only tend to her while she's screaming if i tell him to. even then, unless i'm in the middle of doing something right then, he'll ask me why i can't just do it instead. on top of that, he only holds her if i hand her to him while he's watching tv and she's calm. he stays up late playing video games but still won't get her when she cries, so i have to get up with her. we've talked about it multiple times, to the extent that i've told him i can't handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.

i'm honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. i put the baby in his gaming room and told him i was going out. in reality, i just went to the gas station because i felt like i couldn't trust him, and sure enough when i got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. i took a ~10 second video of this and after i comforted the baby, i sent it to his mother with an explanation of what's going on.

she called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he's upset with me for involving his mother and for ""taking a video out of context."" i'm at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but for sending the video?

edit: the pregnancy was an accident but my boyfriend wanted me to keep it.",3
"for kicking my best friend out and telling him to grow up after he called my baby belly gross and weird?. i've known james since we were 11. he's been my best friend for a long time and we're so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike and even share a last name. he lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. 

i had a crush on him growing up and i asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. he always declined and said we were just best friends. he's really goofy with me, and treats me like i'm his little sister and over time i came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. my parents treat him like a son and honestly, he's family. 

a couple months ago i had a ons and found out i was pregnant. being as i have pcos i am over the moon because i was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. i am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and i cant explain how many tears of relief i shed. i've always wanted to be a mom and finally i have a chance at this. i have my own home, have savings, i'm in the right place in life and i'm so happy. 

when james found out he was also over the moon. he thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. won't go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn't feel like going to the mall, can't come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. 

my mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one i cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. he confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. he said 'i know it's really weird of me but it just creeps me out' 

i found that so demeaning and hurtful, and i burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to gtfo. he apologized and left and i haven't heard from him since. i'm so upset that he's ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump! i want to reach out but i just feel so .... alienated from my own body and made to feel gross and i'm not sure if i'm the one that's being difficult or if it's him.",3
"for denying water to a group of women who were supposedly dehydrated as they refused to pay?. a very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. i've never objected to people crossing our land as i'm an avid hiker and don't want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. it's basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. so she'll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it's a multi day hike). 

it made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. it ""feels like"" 40-45 degrees celsius during june-july. today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. they said they were out of water and asked if i could refill their water bottles. i told them i could for 50cents a bottle. the reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). we aren't connected to an endless supply of water.

they were furious that i refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. i told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (i've drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted i top them up. 

they had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. so i refilled the young girl's bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. they refused and very angrily went on their way. my wife says i should have filled them up, but imo so long as the little girl is okay i don't think they deserved anything given their attitude.",3
"for sleeping over at my gfs 4 nights a week making her roommate uncomfortable and causing her to flip out?. let me preface this by saying that i (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. i've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. this is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. i'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

now, i've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. her beds bigger for starters and i cant cook at home because it's always congested, so liv and i cook a meal twice a week at hers. she has a roommate who we'll call (bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. i've tried my best to get to know bianca but it's not reciprocated and i can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. she's never asked a question about what i do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

liv told me that bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. i hate being the cause of her discomfort. whenever i'm at livs house, i don't use the living room and go straight to livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). besides cooking with liv, i'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

here's where liv and i may have screwed up. we were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). all of a sudden bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
we both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

their relationships gone down the gutters since i came along and i can't help but feel responsible. 

on an end note, liv and i want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

my mates telling me i'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and i should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. but i see it as the next step before moving in together, that i'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. so aita?",3
"for yelling at my sister in law?. context here: i'm an ex heroin addict. the why and how isn't important, but i got hooked at 15, tried to get clean at 17 but relapsed hard, finally got my act together and got off it for good at 21. i'm 26 now and completely clean. i don't even drink, except for on special occasions where i'll have two or three drinks at most.

now, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before i had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that i'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. the first year or so, i understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. however, it's been almost six years since i was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that i'm gonna stay clean.

she's very vocal about these concerns, too. if i get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks i've relapsed again and i'm having withdrawals. she made a huge scene on christmas day two years ago because i had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that i must have been doing a ton of coke. if anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money. i mostly just grin and bear it so as not to make waves, but recently she took it a step too far. 

i went away recently with some friends. on the first day of my trip, i dropped and broke my phone. because she and my brother were unable to get ahold of me for a few days, she became convinced i had gone on a massive dope bender, and began telling my family and friends that she knew this to be the case. when i got home, i found myself being given an intervention and told how disappointed people were. it was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back, and i sort of flipped at my sister in law. i yelled at her, asking why the fuck she doesn't trust me and why she's so hellbent on undermining my success and believing that i'm incapable of staying clean. she got upset and told me she was only concerned for my wellbeing, but i said imo that's bullshit; at this point it's absolutely about her not having faith in me and if she feels that way she should stay the fuck out of my business. at that point  she started crying and she and my brother left. i'm being told left and right that i'm an asshole and ungrateful because she's only looking out for me and i need to apologise, but i'm still upset that she evidently believes i'm incapable of doing this. aita?",3
"for making fun of my boyfriend's penis. upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). in the privacy our relationship, i playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. however, he has complained in the past about how much he hates ""locker room moments"" when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not. 

so the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. one of the cues was something like, ""things that are short"" and i write down, ""my boyfriend's penis"". they were all read aloud and when its revealed that i wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. my boyfriend tries to brush it off ""oh you got me! ha ha"" and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him ""oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro!"" more laughter.

after we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. he said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. he said that by making that joke, all i have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. he wasn't mad, just disappointed. he said that he would never make fun of me if i had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me i was beautiful no matter what. 

i felt really, really bad when he said that. i have apologized and things are fine now but i think that maybe he is blowing this out of proportion? am i the asshole or should he maybe not take this so seriously? ",3
"for dumping my gf after her unannounced backpacking trip. ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.

me and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which i pay for by myself, as i make enough money to afford it and i didn't want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend.
 
we also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn't want to go through that again in this one.

the fact that i pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course i pay in part for). also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother a lot about our lives and future plans.

anyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. however, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across south america which she was going to go on on friday, and that she had been planning this for months.

first i asked if i could come, to which she said no because she would be ""discovering herself"" on this trip, and when i asked why hadn't she told me she said because i wouldn't have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (which is mostly true)

well an argument ensued and at some point i finally put my foot down, it went something like this: 

gf: ""why can't i just go explore the world and live life to its fullest""

me: ""you can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out""

i believe it was the right thing to do as she didn't pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn't have any right to demand to stay, plus i was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.

that night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am i really an asshole for this?

tldr: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, i kicked her out my house.

"for completely ignoring my father's girlfriend. it's more like ""are we the assholes?""

i have a twin (we're 16,m). we have identical faces, but you can't mix us up. i have long blonde hair, he has short black hair and piercings. he's bigger, like he works out. no one mixes us up. 

we have known her for 2 years. she mixes our names up all the time. at least 3 times a day. we know she's doing it on purpose to annoy us. 

so. yesterday i was in living room and she called me my twin's name. i just ignored her and pretended she wasn't there. then she called me my name and i answered her normally. my brother did the same, we did it few times. now she's mad at us, apparently we're being extremely disrespectful and not being sympathetic because she makes ""honest mistake"" sometimes.",3
"for requesting prayer breaks at work because my religious coworkers do even though i'm not religious?. i'm an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. 

i have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. i would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. 

they get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don't need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  

i used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work i do. she couldn't give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. 

even though i'm a known atheist i decided i too wanted some time to meditate everyday. i told my manager i needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. she initially said no, and then i got a hastily written email saying of course i was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. she'd obviously checked with hr and covered her ass. 

for the last six months i've been having my 30 mins 'meditating' out in our company garden everyday. this has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have 'meditative time' and it's causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. 

i recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that i was being rude and 'ruining it' for everyone else and that at xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. i told her i'm not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",3
"for stranding a date without a ride because she was ignoring me?. so last weekend i went on a tinder date with a girl who i've been chatting to for a while. it was our second date and i thought things were going pretty well.

we end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which i recommended. it was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. i awkwardly try to join in but i'm basically ignored. i leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. they're still chatting. i stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. they back into a corner and only talk to each other. 

at this point i go out and grab a smoke. she comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn't seen this guy in ages. i tell her that's cool but i'm just gonna head home soon. she asks me to wait for her bc she doesn't have a ride and it's far from home. 

so i wait bc whatever, night is ruined and i might as well just hang out. i wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her i'm going home and she can either come with me or stay. i see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. i try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. i gesture to her that i'm going and she holds up a finger like ""wait a minute"" and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend. 

i've had it at this point and i just text her ""leaving now, bye"" and head straight to my car and leaves. i get frantic calls about 15 min later. she asks me where i am and if i could go back and pick her up since she doesn't have a ride and her friend doesn't live close to her like i do. i say ""no"" and hang up. 

anyways the next day i get the longest, angriest chain of texts in my life. she's upset because i left her with no ride and she had to beg the bartender to call her a cab because she ran out of cash and can't get uber/lyft for some reason. she calls me a pos and to never call her again and that she'll be telling anyone she knows not to ever go on a date with me.

"for not wanting to break up with my girlfriend/stepsister?. first of all, i know how that sounds, but it's really not like that.

my girlfriend and i were childhood friends turned high school/college sweethearts. we are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. we are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. the same home. because our parents are married.

it's my mom and her dad. both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. when we were in hs we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and i being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.

honestly, i hate being in this situation. even though i know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says ""go tell your sister x"". i think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. my (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to ""what did you expect from the crazy bitch?"" but i see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. my girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. we can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.

this living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. i love this girl and have spent my life with her. i want to spend the rest of my life with her. i just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.

"for (rudely) refusing to give my kid's hand-me-downs and old toys & furniture to my sister?. i found out i was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. when i told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if i had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. i was already living independently, both my boyfriend and i worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. in our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so i thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.

during my pregnancy i asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when i started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when i wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when i was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. they refused, telling me that i was expecting to be catered to. they also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that i was trying to win them over and have them ""forget that i was making dumb decisions"". when i spoke to other relatives my sister ""joked"" that i was trying to get gifts from them. i had severe post-partum depression and thought i was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. my relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. they told me they were afraid i was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.

which brings us to today, 3 years later. my sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than i did when i was treated ""as an independent adult"". our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff i have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. i answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. i've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.

hey again everyone. i finally have answers.

i never gave fake names to anyone so my date is now alice and her sister is gabby.

on saturday i got a facebook message from gabby. it boiled down to ""this is stupid, will you meet alice so she can properly explain?"" i try to get an explanation straight from her, but she refused and so on sunday i go to a coffee shop to figure out wtf is going on. 

she was cute, my crush was strong, but i managed to sit down with a decent poker face. she pretty much burst into tears the moment i arrived. lots of sorrys until she pulled herself together and i really nearly bolted bc i felt so awkward. 

gabby was the one to suggest alice use her pictures. alice showed me her phone and... it was a picture of her from a few months ago and she swiped through and there were more pictures, ones she said she was gonna put on tinder. all of herself... and she was bigger. 

i feel really fucking dumb. still. alice has been losing weight over this last year (down over 100 pounds!!!) and didn't have any flattering pictures bc she's continuing her diet and shredding weight off and her and her sister didn't know how to portray that on tinder without scaring everyone off. so that's why gabby suggested she use her pics bc they believe alice will look like her soon (tho she has probably several months to go before she's close if i'm being honest, not that i care. never did just thought i was being lied to).

when i sent the screenshot, she panicked and blocked me out of embarrassment/shame and it took a talking from her sis to meet me and come clean. i'm the first guy she's gone on a date with that wanted a second date so... fuck. sucks to be all those other guys i guess because i'm taking her out this weekend again. 

i'm gonna be cautious moving forward bc that was a shit ton of drama for a first date, but i don't know. maybe i'm being dumb? she's real sweet and we share the same hobbies and she's even pretty when she cries and my pa always told me that's how you know you're in it for the long haul and holy fuck i need to calm my crush down. this feels like high school again.

and that's that. just wanted to clear up the catfish fiasco since i got a good many comments and pms. thanks again for helping me set my head on straight.",3
"for getting 3 co-workers fired for making a hot list?. a bunch of people from my department at work went for drinks on friday after work. everyone was having a good time and there were about 20 of us there (from about 30 people in our department). i go to the bathroom, and as i am about to exit the hall to the bathroom i hear my co-worker say my name from around the corner of the wall. perhaps i shouldn't have eavesdropped, but curiosity/suspicion got the best of me and i did.

i overheard a conversation of three guys in my department making a ""hot list"" (they actually referred to it as that), which involved ranking every woman in the department from first to last. i was upset and disturbed. i was quite friendly with 2/3 of the guys, actually. yesterday morning i tell hr and they state that they have a zero-tolerance policy for actions like this. all three men were fired first thing this morning, and now i feel terrible.

i hated the way they were talking about women, but i didn't think they should be fired. with that said, we work for a large company that i know takes complaints like this seriously, and would not really miss these 3 guys, so deep down i suppose i knew it was a possibility when i complained. nobody knows that i am the person who reported them, and i've overheard people say that the person is a ""snitch"". i'm wondering if i should have just confronted them at the bar and told them how it made me feel instead, but at the time i didn't feel comfortable doing that. i especially feel bad because i had a fairly good relationship with two of the guys.

aita?

info 1: it was not a formal work event, but our supervisor organized everyone going out for drinks

info 2: a lot of people are insisting that i am upset because i was low on the list. i tried to avoid making this the focus, but with all the comments i feel like i have to address it. i was high on the list, and was not offended about my placement; i was offended about the fact that they were making a list in the first place. i hate that i even have to write this

"if i tell my girlfriend she needs to bring her own food to my house and pay for the food she has eaten?. i want to start off by saying i love my girlfriend and i'm scared that if i give her this rule or expectation it will make her feel unwelcome at my home. we have been dating for awhile now and she's always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn't eat much so i always gave her the okay. after she had spent a week at my place i told her she doesn't have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn't eat much since she's smaller but i didn't take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. she left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. i feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. i can't comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me's so often though since she's here at minimum 2 days a week. she has brought up in the past the fact that she feels i don't take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and i work 3 (not by my choice). i feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she's always making sure i'm taken care of and comfortable. i don't know if i should just suck it up because she's not taking much from me and if i'd be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. wibta?

edit: wow. i think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. my gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought ""haha this reminds me of me and joycemanner!"", saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. all within 20 minutes of making this post! she thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel's back.

edit2: to answer some repeated questions: i made this as a throwaway account. the account name is based off a pretty popular band (joyce manor) i like so, i didn't think she would realize it was me. i'm 26 and she's 20. her name is not joyce. i don't think she'll come on here to give her side of the story.

"for wanting a sunrise wedding?. every year on our anniversary, my fiance and i wake up early to go to the beach and watch the sunrise together. it's a very special tradition, as we have both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us. 

we decided we wanted to incorporate this into our wedding. our plan is to have our ceremony on the beach the and have everyone walk over to a beachfront restaurant for breakfast, bloody marys and mimosas (we've already talked to the restaurant owner about this, who loves the idea and said he'd be happy to open early for us). after that, everyone is free for the remainder of the day. our friends and family are mostly local and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some extended family flying in from canada, but that's unavoidable.

based on our geographic location and the date of the wedding next summer, we've scheduled the ceremony start time for 5:30 a.m., when there should be plenty of light but the sun itself won't be quite visible yet.

i was driving her home one day and said (this is abridged) ""hey i know you're going through a lot of bodily changes right now and you're really growing up. i think it might be time to start wearing deodorant.""

she said ""i smell?"" and i said ""yah, just a little. no big deal. just pick up some deodorant, your mom has some."" 

her parents called and were furious saying she's going through a difficult and sensitive time and how dare i make her insecure about her natural bodily functions. 

i said ""sorry, i thought if roles were reversed i'd want someone to tell me. are you really saying you didn't notice her smelling like bo all the time?"" 

they said she had to come to them and ask for it because someone pushing the issue would make her insecure. and by circumventing her psychological timeline i've given her a complex for the rest of her adolescence, maybe beyond.

so from my perspective i really can't see what i did wrong here. from asking her out until receiving the check, i intended to pay. after she offered to pay, i thanked her and allowed her to pay.

the next day i woke up to angry texts. she said i put her into an awkward position, forcing her to pay the bill. i asked what she wanted me to do differently. apparently i should have argued/insisted that i would pay. my friends agree with her. now i'm wondering if i should just apologize and pay her back.

"for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns?. throwaway for obvious reasons. basically i m42 got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. i got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""andy, sara, kate"". i had these tattoos all done at once after kate was born knowing she would be my last. my oldest child andyt22 came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. my wifef41 immediately supported her and made sure that i would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. it was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. i'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to athena. 

the problem arose yesterday when my wife and athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. the tattoo going down my arm still reads ""andy"" and not ""athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. my wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but i explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""andy"" to ""athena"". i told her i would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which i can not afford either of. i explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that i don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if i don't support who she is, i just need to leave her life. my wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if i don't ""get my act together"". i personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.

i'm determined to move past this as soon as possible and onto better things, the things that i should have achieved had mia not wasted five years of my life. but there's an issue that has me on the fence: i was supposed to donate my kidney to mia's brother tom, and now i don't know if i should do it.

tom has esrd and needs a second kidney transplant as soon as possible because the kidney from his first transplant is failing. i'm not that close to him and i was only going to do it because i wanted to help mia's family in any way i could because i though they were going to be m family. but now that i know that she was just playing me the whole time, i'm having second thoughts. organ donation is a big deal, i will literally risk my life to give part of myself to someone, and at this point i don't want to do it for the brother of the girl who lied to me, used me and made me a fool for five years.

"for telling my girlfriend her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy?. i (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. we met on instagram, i followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. i thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. she makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. 

however, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. she has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like ""she's dirty"", ""kids are all feral"" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. 

recently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. as soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. 

this really annoyed me, i get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. if she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. she just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. i just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. 

also at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.

on the way home, i told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of ""kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is"". i told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks i'm an asshole.

"for being a ""karen"" about my car being ""fixed""?. my car was shaking when i braked from high speeds, my dad told me it was the rotors and i believed him but the deal i got the car from has free diagnostic so i took it there. 

so my dad was right, it was the rotors. my friend had just done the brake pads like a month ago but not the rotors. so the dealer guy said it'll be 650 to get all four rotors shaved down and an oil change (synthetic oil so oil change is like 90 bucks itself). i said ok. 

he calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. i asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. i specially said *do not* cut the backs ones ""do as little as possible"". 

he calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so i needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. i said i told you not to cut those and he was like ""i was just tryna to help you out""


i'm fuming at this point, go to pick up my car. it's 750 for the two front rotors and the oil change (when they had quoted me 850 for all 4 and the oil change?!). i pay and leave. my car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. i bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed. we get into and he's like i'll do the back rotors for free labor but it's 200 for the rotors. i tell him i'll get a lawyer cause i'm not giving him literally another penny, i paid 750 for a car that's worse than before. 


i ask for the manager and eventually they agree that it was their fuck up and they'll eat the back rotors. pick the car up the next day and it's good.

"for inviting my atheist friends only for the wedding party and not the ceremony?. edit: didnt expect this to be a reason to be called a ""child molestator cultist"" but i suppose that's reddit for you?

i am getting married in a few months. we have a few atheist friends who have a general dislike for religion so i thought it would be for the best to only invite them to the party. my future wife and both of our families are roman catholic. catholic ceremonies are *long*. i'm talking 1 hour of pure mass and additional half an hour of the actual ""getting married"" part. if you are not a believer, it is boring af. hell, im catholic and i know i'll be bored for 80% of it. i thought i'll spare them the trouble.

anyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying i forgot to put the time and the church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. so i said that she doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part. she got confused, i explained and she got annoyed to say the least. said she isnt heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. i tried to explain again & fix things but i felt guilty the whole time. 

was it an asshole move?


edit: ah, i suppose i am ta. just for clarification though: 
- we did explain things and they are coming to church. no hard feelings between us. 

- those who i decided to ""spare"" expressed anti-religious-events stances in the past (not going to christenings, first communions & confirmations) so i thought it translated to wedding ceremonies

- i also thought it would be considerate to not force them to come because of the sense of ""they invited me so i have to"" and ended up going wrong about it :/",3
"for being upset my mil won't make a ""family quilt"" for me and my husband because we have no kids?. my mil has made a small ""family quilt"" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). the quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. i was really looking forward to getting ours because i admit i'm a bit of a hipster and i love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.

she recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and i thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. i asked my sil (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. i was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. turns out mil has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.

i message her directly about it because i'm just that kind of person. i like hearing it straight from the other guy. mil says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. i ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though i know it's a lie. i push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little ""break"" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.

i ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. i tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says ""i'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs"" verbatim. i hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.

but now i got a really mean voice message from my sil telling me that i crossed the line and am acting like a huge b\*tch for no reason. i'm shocked because i have a great relationship with my sil and she always defended me from other family bullshit. my husband wants no part in this now. for what i said to my mil?",3
"for basically telling my ex girlfriend that she's not as hot as my current girlfriend?. my ex (24f) and i (24m) dated 5 years ago. we were together for about a year, but then she dumped me out of no where for another guy and broke my heart. she and i shared the same circle of friends so i continued to be cordial with her for the sake of our friend group, and we remained friends until we graduated and i distanced her out of my life and no longer speak to her. i'm still close with my friend group, but they have drifted from her over the past year. i'll still see her sometimes when we have hang outs with the larger group, but i no longer speak to her and we just avoid each other.

this past weekend my friend had a pre-game/party for his birthday and she was invited along with our other friends. i have a new girlfriend (23f) that i have been dating for a few months (she is absolutely amazing, drop dead gorgeous, kind hearted, thoughtful, etc. i never thought i could feel this way about someone). i invited her too, and she knew my ex would be there but was okay with it.

at the pre-game, my ex had a couple shots, was maybe tipsy. she came up to me and my girlfriend and started talking to us normally. i was kind of confused as to why, but just went with it. she then says to my girlfriend, ""hey did you know me and ilovepotatoes22 used to date back in the day?"" to which she says, ""yes, i'm aware"". ex gf smirks very subtly and under her breath says, ""yup and he sure downgraded"" while looking me dead in the eye. my gf said ""wow, i'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me"" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. i was angry, i truly don't believe i ""downgraded"" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes i do find her more attractive than my ex. i told my ex ""i'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again"". 

she went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them i called her uglier than my current gf. i told my friends what actually happened and they understand but they told me i could have been a little bit less harsh. ex gf is apparently really depressed and has been telling my friends that she doesn't want to come to any of the hang outs anymore. am i the asshole?",3
"forbidding my wife from using my daughters old room. this has been an ongoing argument between my wife and i, but it resulted in a huge argument today and i'm starting to wonder if i'm in the wrong. i think it's impossible for someone in my position to see my wife's point of view fairly so tell me who's the asshole here. i'm also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it's solely this topic/argument that i'm interested in hearing your judgement on.

so my wife and i have two kids together. but before i met my wife i had a daughter with my now ex-wife. my daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. we haven't said a word to each other in almost a decade and i have no desire to speak with her anyway.

i still own the same house as then and i've pretty much left my daughters room as it was. at first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it's kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? i can't really explain the logic behind it because i don't think there is any. it just doesn't feel right to change her room.

this has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and i have really had. the house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there's my daughters old room. my kids know not to go in there and it's just left there. occasionally i will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. it's therapeutic in some weird way.

my wife has always wanted to change the room. at first it was because she wanted a study, but i refused and eventually she gave up. 

we're now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. again i put my foot down and said that wasn't an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.

 she really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. she was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. she was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. she said a lot of things but i think that basically sums it up.

when she said these things i was really hurt. but i've had a few hours to think it over, and i think i might be the unreasonable asshole here. it's not fair to make my kids share a room because i won't let go of the past. it's not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn't my first love.

"for singling someone out at a comedy show?. i do stand up. i also have a day job, because, you know, survival. 

i mentioned at work that i couldn't do any shifts after 4:00 on saturday because i had a show. my coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. 

i had no problem helping him out and i knew this club wouldn't care if i slid a couple people in. but i've been trying to get more bookings at this place and it's kind of a level up from the sort of places i usually get to perform at so i told them, you know, ""please make a point to laugh.""

i'm up there doing my show and i see them and they're the only ones in the relatively intimate audience who aren't laughing. it bugs me a little but i didn't want to lose my rhythm so just ignored them. then i see that in this dark room that seats, max, forty people this guy is texting with his phone screen on full brightness. 

so i start telling a joke about a time i gave friends from work tickets to see me and they texted through the whole thing and as i'm doing it i'm slowly approaching their table (and the audience realizes i'm talking about these people at this show) yet he doesn't notice or look up until i'm literally off the stage, approaching the foot of his table, staring at him. 

it killed, so that was the good part. but when i showed up to work i was expecting an apology from him. instead he was expecting an apology from me for (i'm quoting here) ""inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke"" ""making him look like a fool in front of his girl"" and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. 

he basically summarized it as ""you're supposed to be a professional and if you couldn't handle me texting you shouldn't be in show business.""

i think, without question, that he's the asshole. but he doesn't believe me and the only people i could tell this story to and ask to confirm i'm not crazy and my real life friends, so, biased. 

who's the asshole?

"- mad at my wife for throwing away pendant from previous marriage. i'm really upset with my wife after what she's done, but everyone of our friends/family thinks she is right to do what  she did. so i'm posting here to get an unbiased perspective.

i've been married to my current wife for three years. we dated for 2 years before getting married. before meeting my current wife i had been married to my ""high school sweetheart"" for well over a decade.

my late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. it was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and i didn't start dating again for several years after the fact. i never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.

i've always had a momento from my previous marriage. it was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. she gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. before meeting my current wife i would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.

when i met my current wife she wasn't comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. so i started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it's an extremely important item to me. for a time she accepted that until recently.

over the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she'd bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding i get rid of it. i can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but i had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... why can't she accept it's very important to me?

long story short, when i was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. when i found out i broke down because it was literally the last thing i had to remember my late wife.

 i don't know. maybe i am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. aita?

"for ordering jalapeños on my pizza intentionally to stop my wife eating it?. first up, i love my wife very very very much but damn does she drive crazy sometimes. i'm a big dude, i'm 6'4 and i'm always goddamned hungry. i'm a firefighter so i'm always on my feet and simply put, i just love foooooood. my wife always eats stuff like salads and nuts but she will always help herself to some of my food which pisses me off because it's just the right amount of food that i want to eat but she'll go ahead and take some. 

i've asked her so many times to leave my food alone and she'll get really defensive and say 'it's just a little babe, you'll be fine!' except i'm not fine, i'm hungry. and then when i'm hungry i get hangry and i snap at everyone cuz i'm goddamned hungry!

things came to ahead at our kids 3rd birthday party. wife said no to cake, despite me bringing over a slice
to her, so i gave that slice to my cousins kid who was on his second slice. my girl ended up eating the whole slice whilst i held the goddamn plate and then when i went to get myself some all the cake had finished.

lately my mil gave me the idea to just spice my food to stop my wife from taking mine, since she can't stand spicy food.  i tried that yesterday, i ordered pizza and asked my wife if she wanted one. she said no. i went ahead and got pepperoni and jalapeños, and predictably when it came she came over and got all mad because it was spicy and she couldn't eat it.

i told her i had to take drastic measures because i'm fed up of sharing my food and she called me a selfish asshole.

"for telling my mom she's the reason i don't want any kids?. i (23f) am the oldest of 4 siblings. my dad passed away when i was 14, leaving us and my mom. 

there's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. so when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. if i had to guess i'd say i spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. plus an hour or so on chores. 

now i love my siblings, and i love my mom. but from when i was 14 till i moved out at 19 i had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. all there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. 

i'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. i've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. i've politely told her i don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. 

when she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after i told her to stop asking) i told her ""giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me."" i didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. 

she cried. i told her i don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. i didn't apologise. 

aita?

edit: when i said ""taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't"" i wasn't trying to be malicious. 
a) she at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why i had to. 
b) i called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, i had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. 

i wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why i said it that way.

edit 2: yes, i'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. i was there. i never said i don't sympathise or that it was easy for her. i'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact that my teenage years where very tough, and i don't want kids because of that.

edit 3: for the people pming and commenting about how it's my fault i didn't have friends and not my mom's: i wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared it would distract me from watching my siblings.

last edit: for everyone asking, my mom worked 9-6:30.

actually the last edit: my mom came home around 6:30, that didn't mean i only watched the kids till 06:30. i usually was the one who cooked dinner and put them to bed, my mom was tired after work.",3
"for laughing at a guy throwing dollars on my girlfriend at a club?. my gf and i were out at a club to see a dj. we were dancing, drinking, having a good time. my gf has been doing yoga for a few years and when she's especially sauced she likes to throw in some splits and stuff on the dance floor. well, we got sauced and as she's doing her 3rd split or so a guy comes up and ""makes it rain"" on her - literally like 4 dollars. obviously he was making a joke that she was dancing like a stripper. whatever. this happened and in the moment i just fucking started laughing. i thought it was legitimately funny in the moment. my girlfriend gets up and says ""we're fucking leaving"" and basically storms out. get outside and she's basically telling me that i should've punched the dude out or something and that he made her feel like a whore and i'm an asshole for laughing. i'm fucking 31, i'm not punching anyone out at a bar unless they're actually getting physical or threatening to get physical. while i agree that it might've been somewhat demeaning, i also think it was objectively funny. aita?",3
"update: for arguing with my wife over her preferring to sleep with a body pillow over me?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/d8c3ic/aita_for_arguing_with_my_wife_over_her_preferring/

so a bit of a weird update since my wife actually saw this thread through her coworker. (e: to clarify, the coworker didn't know that it was about my wife, she was just sharing an interesting thread)

she texted me asking if i was looking to buy a new bed and i said yes without thinking much of it. she then linked me this thread and said we would talk later that night (not in a bad way).

we sat down and she apologized for calling me a baby and i apologized for starting a fight over something so small. 

she said that she really enjoys the pillow but we can get rid of it and sleep together instead. i told her this isn't necessary and that i would deal with it but she insisted. 

i've ordered her a new body pillow that just covers one side of her that she could put on the opposite side of me so hopefully everyone can be comfortable. 

everything worked out and we have been sleeping together for the past couple weeks now. the new body pillow came in and is on the opposite side of her. she switches between me and the pillow every now and then and it's not a big deal. a lot more comfortable to sleep now too haha. 


thanks to everyone who pmed me giving me advice as well as those giving advice in the comments. 

i tried to emphasize this as much as i could in the comments but seriously my wife and i never fight and this was extremely out of the norm for us. 

everything is good now though and we are going to start doing date nights again on saturday and it's been going well. feels more like our relationship when it was just starting out in the ""honey moon"" period kinda thing. 

but yeah, everything's fine now. to be honest it was always fine, this was just a minor thing that some how got blown out of proportion. i barely remember but i think we were both just stressed with work that day so we ended up getting into a silly fight. 

seriously i love my wife so hopefully no judgement by you guys on the one comment she said back then. she's honestly a really good person!

i made an update thread a few weeks back but was a few days early for the minimum and someone commented on the old thread a few days ago so i remembered to repost the update thread today with a few more updates.

thanks everyone :)

for telling my british neighbors they should learn chinese because we live in china?. i saw s similar post which inspire me this. i'm albanian and i live in guangzhou china. i live in an apartment building that's filled wit mostly chinese people and one british couple. they've been here 3 years longer than i have and can't say anything other than nihao and xiexie. they constantly knock on my door or call me to translate chinese stuff to which i told them to stop and start learning chinese. i taught myself to be half fluent in chinese before i got my work assignment and learnt the rest in the 6 months i've been here. they managed to get by because some of the staff spoke basic english but they left. i told them that they've been here for several years and should be at least conversational in chinese. yeag chinese is hard butvits inconsiderate and rude to not put any effort into learning chinese. i told them im never translating for them again and they lost their shit saying i'm an asshole and i'm making their lives difficult. i told them i'll start speaking to them in chinese and albanian from now on,3
"for surrendering my sister's child to protective services when she forced me to babysit due to mental health?. i'm 26m, my sister is 28f. we're the only family we both have, neither of our parents are with us anymore and we have no aunts, uncles, or cousins. i'm single, so is my sister: she's a single mother of a 3 year old. despite all of this, we're not particularly close. we live in the same city but i might see her once a year in passing.

to make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. she said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and i was the only person who could help. i couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. she took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. she left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.

it took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. he was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. they took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. i have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. i can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.

i'm just not equipped to handle a kid. my home isn't child proof, i have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. i work full time, i'm in school. i couldn't think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. i feel like i let my sister down but first and foremost i believe she let her own child down. i don't know what's going to happen.

was i the asshole?

**edit**: just so there's more info, i wasn't even left the base the car seat latches into. never mind i don't even have a car. i'll admit i could have asked a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn't address anything else.

child services is what its name implies, here where i live it's called facs. they work with families in struggling times like this. i told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. they left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because i'm not the parent. even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.

i didn't ""put the kid up for adoption"" it doesn't work like that. i contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. my best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out. i don't know anything else beyond my best guess.

and i can't just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies like the one i contacted can offload the work for me. it's been 8 days and no word on anything: if i took eight days off work with no telling when i could return, i might as well not return.",3

* ""i'm with the milf"" 
* ""to-do list: eat, poop, suck some titties""

"for not accommodating a vegan guest?. longtime lurker here. hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.

so my wife (29f) and i (29m) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we've lived in our current city. we like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. we have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it's become a great tradition in our social circle. 

our friend james started dating his girlfriend sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that sarah was vegan. i thanked james for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. he agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. everything was fine, until now.

during our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. my wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn't push the issue. 

however, after the meal, james took us aside privately and told us that sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. he added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

my wife feels terrible that sarah was so upset and apologized to her and james profusely, but i don't agree that we did anything wrong. i like sarah very much as a person and i don't have anything against her dietary choices, but i don't believe it's fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. for the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. aita?",3
"for not punishing my son after he came up with a pretty elaborate plan to ""peep"" on the neighbor girl topless in her back yard?. lots and lots of ugly background here but i'll try not to wander. my wife i have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in may. i have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. 

on monday i came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. i asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. they said they were playing army and since i've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, i knew their parents wouldn't mind either. so i told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case i needed him to come down. i was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. so they did this every day this week until thursday when my daughter came home from her cit job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if i was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. i climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where i assume the girl had usually sat. i told my son to knock it off and he said he would. 

this morning i got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would ""confront"" me and my son saturday morning. we sat down and it went from a calm ""this is something we're concerned about"" to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an ""adolescent sex ring"" in a matter of seconds. i tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and i've gotten them to stop. my wife asked if i planned on punishing him, i said that i don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. my neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. i told her that was really overkill. my wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and i asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. my wife has texted me that i am being incredibly irresponsible and if i don't do ""something"" she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. in all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend!

"update for not sharing my prize with a mentally handicapped person in a contest?. original thread(https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bihmbc/aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a_mentally/)

my wife went yesterday to collect our winnings and they shorted her $500. my wife is of the timid type and didn't want a conflict so she took the reduced winnings and had a few choice words but otherwise didn't contest it. they gave the rest to jessica. they made up a fake story to her that they made a 2nd place prize on the spot and jessica won it, thanks to the generosity of my wife and i. this was all bogus.

we made a post on our community facebook page saying we had a great time at the competition but didn't appreciate the comments we received or how we were treated. i guess jessica's family got wind of this and contacted my wife to meet up earlier today.

jessica's family gave us the money back and while they were excited at first, couldn't take it under false pretenses. they found it condescending to give jessica a prize just for having asd. it was a joint decision between jessica and her parents.

we talked a bit and learned jessica only joined because she's writing a cookbook for an asperger's syndrome organization. she's apparently an avid cook and has trouble keeping everything consistent every time, so it's half for her and half for this organization. part of why she went to the competition is to raise awareness of the cookbook itself as well as asd/ass and hopefully win, of course. we didn't know any of this at all, and i guess this is why the organizers wanted good pr.

my wife asked her if there was anything she could do and she can. she's going to help out where she can or if jessica needs assistance. things like editing, photography, etc. i guess everything turned out okay for everyone in the end, except my contempt for the competition organizers.

ps: here(https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bihmbc/aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a_mentally/em15ywu/)'s the recipe i used, a lot of people asked for it in the previous thread. here(https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bjai4e/update_aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a/em7gekx/) it is rewritten to be less ambiguous/more info.

pps: yes, i know ""mentally handicapped"" isn't the right verbiage. i've learned a lot about asd in the last few days. i only kept it to be congruent with the previous post. autism and asperger's in particular may not always or ever be a mental handicap, i should have said disabled instead judging by a few comments.",3

i call my husband and tell him and he's like ""oh ok did you get on the pill?"" and i said no, i didn't want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said i need to be on birth control because it's the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced i'm like trying to get pregnant without his consent. should i have called and discussed this with him since it effects him too (as in he has to wear a condom)

"for wanting my girlfriend to wear makeup and take care of body hair?. i know how the title sounds, hear me out. my \26m\ gf \24f\ takes forever in the bathroom. upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. when i playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago i was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. she said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. i told her that i got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that i also do to stay presentable. her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. now she's saying i have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which i find crazy as i'm not her sugar daddy. why should i pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?

i understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. i haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am i enforcing any ultimatums. if, as she says, i've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. if we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should i pay? anyone who says i'm ta, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? be honest with yourselves.

**gf's side:** he keeps being a dick about how long i would take in the bathroom, so as he said, i quit things he didn't even realize i was doing. no makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, i have curly frizzy hair so i stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. do i look like a beast? sure. am i a comfy, smug beast? hell yes.

he rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so i obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. i'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that i stopped, i feel like... why do i ever have to do all this shit. it's unfair. and if i have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. i conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. conservatively. he should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. otherwise it's not fair.

**both:** we love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. we recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.

**edit (from bf):** alright, i'm the asshole. you know, it wasn't even the people saying i *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying i wasn't. no way in hell do i want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think i'm not ta then i definitely am. my girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, ""in stained shirts and greasy hair"". jesus. the amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that i'm not ta and the reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man.

i think it's reasonable to say that i'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case i would either pay up or we break up. however, luckily, i am still very much into her. i would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and i think those who pointed out that i should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. as i said before, this was never a fight. and for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me i can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight.

**edit 2 (from gf):** thank you, reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. he let me shave his legs. he said he feels like a dolphin. i've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (i didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",3
"for taking back the birthday gift i gave my sister?. so, i'm 24m. my little sister is 14 and has always been interested in art. i moved an hour and a half away when i was 18 and we 
don't see eachother often, but i make a point to call/text


it was her birthday yesterday and i thought i'd splurge since she's been going through a rough time. she's changed schools twice due to bullying and our mom always tells me that she won't talk to anyone, is having intense mood swings, etc. i've made multiple attempts to help her, but she shuts me down and gets snippy.



anyway, i got her a set of 150$ artist grade markers called copics. i'm no art connoisseur, but apparently every artist who's anybody has them and our parents don't wanna spend that kind of money for her hobby (they're about 5$ per marker) and tend to give practical gifts like clothes. whenever we've texted recently it's been her ranting about them not getting them for her.

even on her birthday she was like a bomb about to go off. she barely acknowledged me and only said hello when she was asked. i was excited to give her the gift but the second i opened it she grabbed them and turned to our mom, saying ""see! even he knows you should've got them for me!"" which i awkwardly brushed off. everytime she opened a gift from our parents it was very snotty like ""oh, yayyyy, cheap sneakers, my favorite."" ""a plaid skirt. wow. i'm blessed."" 


i was prepared for an angsty teen, but i soon reached my limit. our dad showed her a journal they bought and she suddenly yelled ""i told you both exactly what i wanted but you spent the same amount of money on shit i don't need! fuck this!"" she threw it against the wall and ran up to her room.



our parents were a lot less well-off when i was her age, and they could barely afford a birthday for me. everytime it was a dodgy cake and a handful of clothes without holes in them, i accepted them like i was the luckiest kid ever. i would've never swore and yelled but she's been very spoiled.


i talked with them for awhile and apparently shes done worse before which shocks me. they think even if they can afford it now, she should learn the value of a dollar. i agree helped shape me to not have my every whim be attended to. besides, she got what she wanted in the end, why is she still mad in the first place?


sister came back to get the markers, but i took them back. i said that she was ungrateful and i wouldn't tolerate it. she started screaming at me but i just left the ""party"" prematurely with the gift in tow.



my whole family is blowing up my phone because i ""ruined her birthday"". in my eyes, i spent 150$ to get no thank-you and yelled at. this will teach her a valuable lesson and maybe spark a change in her teen angst phase. but my family doesn't want to hear from me until i give it back. considering i've got my entire family shitting on me, i have to wonder if i did make the wrong choice. so, reddit, aita?",3
"for telling my gf she doesn't understand real life?. i'm m23 my gf is f21 and we've been together for about 2 years now. now i come from a very middle class family, dads a blue collar worker and mom has been working since i was a kid as well. my gf's family is filthy rich and even she'll admit she's spoiled, everything paid for and a 3k a month allowance. because of this she's never had a job, doesn't care about school really (she's doing fine though but in a easy program), or about having to make money in the future. my car broke down recently and i've been taking the bus/subway to work and she's been razzing me about it saying its sketchy taking public transport etc. i told her i'm saving up again for a honda, and will get it next month. she just tells me to ask my parents for the money or dip into my savings. i told her she has no idea how most people live real life so she shouldn't be giving out financial advice because her dad funds her whole life. she got very pissed at me and said that she's not dumb and so on and basically called me a huge asshole. her friends also contacted me and told me to apologize to her, and oh her friends are the exact same way. spoiled rich white girls who go to western (my ontario mans will get this one). i told them to kick rocks.

"for serving myself the biggest piece of meat?. my boyfriend and i have been together for about 2 1/2 years. we live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. we have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. i wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but i do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when i can. bf doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. 

for reference, i am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. he is a 5'7 170lb guy. 

on sunday i went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. if you're familiar, it's 13er james peak in co. it was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). i had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. suffice to say, i was pretty hungry by dinner time. i made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. when it came time to eat, because of my big day, i grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. we're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. 

bf got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. he told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. i told him that i'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. 

he told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. i said that i agreed, but again, i'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. he told me i should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. 

we've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). so far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. i think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general. 

aita? is this just really dumb?",3
"for telling my brother to stop complaining about child support since he chose to have sex with a woman he barely knew?. my brother (26/m) has a one year old son with a woman he was never in a relationship with, apparently they were friends with benefits. 

long story short she got pregnant, he wanted her to abort and she refused, she had the baby, he got a dna test confirming he's the dad, now he pays child support. they share custody. 

i had dinner with him the other day and as usually he bitched about how child support is unfair, etc. i told him for the first time that it's his fault. he chose to have sex knowing the risk of pregnancy. he got mad and said it's not fair because women can abort but men can't, i told him he knew that before he has sex with her but he still risked it. he called me an asshole, but i was just being honest.

edit it:

"for not honoring my son's punishment?. update 2: i told my ex to cancel her vacation as my son will not be going because it affects my custody time. yes, i told her it was okay but after her husband's stunt of saying he couldn't do the sleepover which was on my day anyways, i had to crack the whip. let those two eat each other alive. they deserve each other.

update 1: this hilarious. my son's best friend mom emailed us an invite for a sleepover which is on my day. i was going to see if my son wanted to go, but my ex's husband said my son could not go as he was grounded. i can react in so many ways...


his mom and i are divorced and don't have much of a relationship. cordial, but indifferent. our son is now 11 and my ex remarried a few years ago but she was with the guy for some time.

we have 50/50. she requested that she have him for two weeks for vacation. i agreed even though this ate into my time with him. apparently, he got into it with step dad and he got grounded for a week. well, most of that week is my week with him before he leaves for vacation with them and she asked me to see to it that his grounding continues through my time. i won't see him for three weeks. i am not saying not to punish him. 

punish him when he's on their time. 

i have no problems with him when he's with me.

i refused.

i already made plans to make most if the days that i have him and i'm sure as hell am not going to cancel those plans because he mouthed off to step-dad. i don't care much for step-dad anyways. what i do with my son on my time is my business and vice-versa. 

also, i don't want to set precedent where i am the parent who has to do both sides of discipline.


edit: update: my son called him a ""freaking asshole."" my ex calls him the same thing when they fight. her words, not mine. he learned it from her, not me. i don't open share my dislike for her husband. maybe an eyeroll, but i'm too corporate and professional to do it in front of my son.",3
"for leaving my fiance over his reaction to me getting a student suspended. i am a librarian at a prek-12 school. i lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.

for any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. a lot. it's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. they don't realize what they're doing. usually i just say ""watch your hands!"" or gently move their hands away, but i don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.

one day, i was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. he stumbled and grabbed my chest. again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, ""looks like ms. aitaitaita is letting the boys cop a feel."" i went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out and grabs my boob. i could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and i took him straight to the office. the principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. the suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.

i told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. he said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. i pushed back because i think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because i weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. he also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a ""joke."" i pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me i should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.

i tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and i felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so i decided to break off the engagement. his friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. aita?

edit: thanks for your responses everyone, especially those of you pming me telling me to kill myself or that i'm an emotional bitch who should listen to the logical men or i will die alone :)))))) love u all",3
"for getting a family thrown out of a restaurant for underage drinking?. throwaway account.  we were at a local restaurant last saturday evening. this is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. there was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  there was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. a beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. there was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

but as i watched i noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who i assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. in fact, i'd guess the 4th girl consumed most of the mom's margarita. i mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. full disclosure that i'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. so i mentioned it to the hostess. a short time later a manager (i assume) came and asked to see the girls' id's. the girl with her own drink produced one. the second girl who had been drinking from mom's drink did not.  i did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. i assume they were asked to do so.

"for 'promoting religion at work'?. i'm a man with a hindu background working in the uk - that is to say i'm not very religious but my family are and if they're doing something related i don't mind joining in. it was a diwali this past weekend which is a pretty major festival in the hindu religion. 

i had a lot of indian sweets left over, and so i decided to bring 2 unopened boxes and leave them in the break room. at the end of our morning briefing, i stood up and said 'hey, it was diwali yesterday and so i brought in these sweets. help yourself and happy diwali!'. 

what was meant to be a nice gesture to ingratiate myself (i only started a fortnight ago) has left me seething after a meeting with hr. apparently, referencing diwali was akin to promoting a religion and therefore inappropriate at work. apparently i'd also given out hindu sweets (this i find ridiculous as they are just indian sweets with no religious connotations).

to me, it's no different from saying happy christmas which i know this company has no issue with, as evidenced by their christmas promotional video i watched in preparation for my interview. 

to be clear i know i'm not ta for brining in sweets, my question is to do with the promoting religion bit. i'm pretty sure i did no such thing, but it's possible i'm being blinded by my own involvement in the issue.",3
"update: for refusing to wear a wig to my friend's wedding?. the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c0xp8l/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_wig_to_my_friends/?st=jx7kr9p2&sh=bd95d6aa

so first of all, thank you so much for your replies and advice! i'm writing an update post because things ended up working out well, and because i want people to see my friend isn't actually a horrible person like people were saying she was.

i texted her asking if we could work things out over a phone call (we don't live in the same state, so our relationship is over phone and text). it turns out a lot of you were right and my friend was being pressured to ask me to wear a wig. her future mother in law found out about my shaved head and pitched a fit. like i said in a comment, my friend can be a huge pushover, and this woman is apparently a nightmare. she's also paying for vast majority of the wedding, so my friend felt even more beholden to what she wanted. that's why she told me she couldn't pay for the wig: mother in law refused to. neither of them knew how expensive a good wig can be, my friend only found out when i told her over the phone. that's also why our dresses, shoes and makeup weren't covered. it turns out my friend is mortified by what she sees as her mother in law making her look cheap and greedy, but she didn't want to tell us that because she's already embarrassed to be relying on her mother in law's money. (apparently it's her fiance's family insisting on a huge extravagant wedding.) 

that's why her reasons didn't ring true to me as well. she didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me that her mother in law was being so judgmental of me, so she basically blurted out the first things that came into her head. she assured me she thinks i look great with short hair and apologized for making me think she thought i look bad. 

i know people will question how i can believe her, but i've been friends with her for nearly ten years and i give her the benefit of the doubt. we've been there for each other through a lot and really care about one another. 

i'm still side eyeing the plantation wedding but i didn't tell her that because she seemed so stressed out by essentially being bullied by her fiance's family i didn't want to pile on. i do know for a fact that she only wanted that venue for the big oak trees all over the property, which are admittedly beautiful. i went to the plantation's website and they do acknowledge slavery's evils and even have a memorial to everyone who was enslaved there, so that makes me feel slightly better. 

i did tell her that asking me as a mixed girl to wear a blonde wig could be seen as racially insensitive and i explained why. she was horrified and apologized over and over sincerely. she wants to stand out from her bridesmaids in pictures, and she didn't even consider the racial implications of asking me because most of her bridesmaids are blonde. she's kind of oblivious to things like that (so are a lot of people!) but the few times i've had to point out something she said could be hurtful she's always been understanding instead of defensive. 

i decided i'm going to grow out my hair as much as possible for the wedding just to help her not get grief from her monster in law. it'll still be pretty short, so that's okay. she's fine with that too except she was worried i'll still have to deal with snide remarks from her fiance's family. i reassured her that after nearly a decade with short hair i've pretty much heard it all. by the time we hung up i felt way better not only about the wedding, but about our friendship.",3
"for not replacing my sisters $3000 gaming laptop after my child spilled juice on it because it was on the floor?. title is pretty self explanatory. but basically over the weekend, i had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. she's babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. she gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. things happen and somehow it got knocked over.

her laptop no longer switches on. she's blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. i told her no as it shouldn't have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. she's refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she'll never babysit for me ever again. i really don't feel as though it's my responsibility.. aita?

edit: yikes this blew up. a few people have asked for more info. yes, i packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. i supplied everything he'd need for the weekend - including nappies and food. my parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she'd be able to spend time with him. it wasn't just 'babysitting' but more enjoying time with her nephew. i gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as 'payment' for watching my son. every other time she'd had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach.",3
"if i don't share my rather large (to me at least) inheritance with my aunt and 3 cousins?. 

some background: my grandfather just passed away at the end of january. he was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. 

this is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. his only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. but to my huge surprised i was named as his sole heir with life changing money. with the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. 

here's where it gets even stickier. my mom passed away 6 years ago. she had one sister who i was fairly close to and from her i have 3 cousins. i don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" i have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and i don't know if they ever met him. to be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like i did. cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral i set up for my grandpa either. 


now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that i split the estate 5 ways. 

this is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:
no matter what i shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. if i do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. 

i can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. the first attorney strongly advised i do this. 

i do nothing. i am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. this is my second attorney's preferred course of action. 

but this is not about the legality of the situation. this is about what should i do and would i be the asshole if i keep the entire estate for myself. just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. i have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. i could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. 

basically, if i don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?",3
"for not letting my wife have mothers day after she ""canceled"" fathers day?. so, this is a little strange of a situation but hear me out.

&#x200b;

i've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. i love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. she is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  i will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). one of her big beliefs though is with holidays. she still celebrates holidays with the family (christmas, easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the ""money"" side of things. we're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.

last year in june my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. i was a little hesitant but i agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.

well, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. all of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. i obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. all of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. she's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. we fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.

"for lying to my son's girlfriend's parents?. my son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  they are both 16.  her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and i pick him up in the evening.  i will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.

the mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  it's her house.  most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  he is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .wtf?  and she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  they also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  whatever.

regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   well, today she came over for the first time.   the night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  i am a correctional officer and was working that night, so i wasn't home to take the call.  my son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   i don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  my husband agreed.

thing is, we don't really care.  i was sexually active at a younger age than them.  my son and i have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  he is a lovely boy, and i believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  they have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  anyway, not only did i not check on them constantly, i told him that as long as she was willing, i would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  my husband and i actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and i asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  good friend laughed and agreed.   turns out it wasn't needed.   dad eventually came and picked her up.

i absolutely stand by my opinion that my son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but i am kind of wondering if i should have made that choice for someone else's child.  i kind of feel guilty, but i think her parents are way over the top control freaks.

"for not wanting my kids every weekend?. my ex husband and i share custody of our 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. we have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like i have the kids friday after school and then he gets them monday after school. i get them back wednesday after school and then he gets them friday after school and then the week flip flops. we've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. i'm a nurse in the or so i schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad. 

recently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. my son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if i have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until i'm done. my ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). while they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, i do not want to give up my free weekends. it took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. my ex agreed if there was a weekend trip i wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but i honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips. 

i was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. my sister pointed out that if i was still married, then i wouldn't have all the child free time i have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like i do. my mom said she can't believe i'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. my sil seemed to understand where i was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever i was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the nyc shopping trip i had planned for december and my son would happily join me for my saturday morning spin classes. i considered that but my sil loves taking her kids everywhere so i don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go. they were really making me feel like an asshole though. aita?",3
"if i don't let my daughter put a lock on her door?. my daughter has recently turned 16 and, for a couple of months now, has been constantly asking for a lock to be put on her door.  she says it's to keep her brother out - who barges into her room every now and then to bother her - but i'm not sure if the benefit is worth having the lock in place.

i don't like the secrecy of her locking herself in her room and i'm worried she's trying to hide something from me or that she'll take the opportunity to lock me out. i admit that i've forgotten to knock sometimes but other than that i see no reason as to why she'd need a lock. 

the way i see it, it's my house and i am simply unwilling to have any locks put in anywhere. she's young, and doesn't really know what's she's asking for.

so, if i don't let her get the lock installed?",3
"for choosing my biological child over my foster son?. my husband and i never thought that we could get pregnant, so we got plenty of therapy after a few failed treatments and moved to fostering with the intent to adopt. we've had a few fosters, but this concerns our current foster, a 9 year old who's been with us for two years. he's a spirited boy, but not a bad kid. just takes a lot of time, money, and mental energy. 

the child's case plan has now moved to adoption, and we were identified as an adoptive resource. we were taking the first steps towards adoption when we found out that i was pregnant. it was mind-blowing as this is my first pregnancy, and i am now over 40. i had thought i had finally hit menopause, but was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. 

unfortunately, after thinking we could do both, we did the hard math, and with our work and our finances, the only way we could raise our foster son is if we terminate this pregnancy. we can't financially have both children. i can't emotionally bring myself to terminate what is realistically our only chance at a biological child, who i am already bonding with. my husband wouldn't think of it either. we have to refuse the adoption. 

unfortunately still, our foster son knows of preparations for an adoption through his therapist and social worker, so now we're taking him away from a stable home and what may be his only chance of adoption as he is older, all for reasons that aren't his fault. am i the asshole for putting a still unborn child above him?

edit: 

baby:
baby has passed prenatal testing with flying colors.

finances:

we currently live in a 2 bedroom condo. we are required to give foster son his own room, which is not possible with a baby by social services standards. us moving into the living room doesn't pass either. social services is giving us until january to find a larger place, but we would have to stay in the county. we can't afford 3 bedroom places in the county, as it's a costly area.

we don't qualify for assistance with both of us working, and if one of us quits, we wouldn't be able to afford our current place even with the assistance we could get. both of us working would make it difficult to swing appointments for two children as well. it's a catch 22 basically.",3

"for telling a coworker i was going to ""make a baby"" and name it a name she wants?. this is the dumbest argument i've ever been involved in, and definitely the most absurd work conversation, too.

i have a friend, ""julie"", who has just come back from maternity leave. she and i work on neighbouring desks, and the setup is that the longest part of our desks are against each other in a way that leaves us effectively sitting on opposite sides of one large desk. we were on lunch break, eating at our desks, and julie asks me about when my husband and i are planning on having kids.

i reply ""it's in the works, hopefully within the next year. definitely sooner rather than later""

then another coworker, who sits on the next set of desks over, hears us talking. her name is ""anna"" and i'll admit that julie and i don't really like her, and try and avoid conversations with her in general.

anna interrupts us and says ""hubby and i are working on having a baby right now.""

julie says ""that's lovely.""

anna then says something about hardly being able to wait for baby ""joseph"".

i say ""that's a lovely name, my father is called joseph.""

anna then says in a light tone, but there's clearly some venom to it, ""don't you go stealing my name now"" and laughs.

i'm a bit taken aback by this, tbh. i'm not offended but it's just a bit like '... ohhhkay, never mentioned it but... sure', and it's really confusing to me because i know about a dozen josephs, it's not exactly a unique name or something anyone could ""steal"".

julie tries to change the subject, but there's 2 more occasions during the rest of the work day where anna just sort of says something to me about not ""stealing her name"", both times in the same jokey but menacing tone. at this stage she's getting on my nerves.

and then anna says right as we're leaving ""promise me you'll wait until after me so i get joseph"", and as she says it she laughs like it's a really funny joke. julie and i give each other a look that says we really do not get this joke and i realise that she's said i should wait until after she gets pregnant for me to get pregnant in case i ""steal"" the name joseph.

we all head off, the three of us end up in the lift together, and julie asks about my plans for tonight. i say, totally deadpan, ""going to make a baby. the name joseph is so rare i'm worried someone is going to steal it if i'm not quick enough"" and julie and i both burst out laughing.

anna is really really offended. cannot stress enough how livid she was after hearing me say that. julie and i both think it's really funny but i told my sister and she says that while it was funny, i was kind of a bitch about the whole thing. i am now doubting how funny it actually was.

am i ta?

&#x200b;

backstory because people are asking: anna was fine when she first started working here a couple years ago, but she was a little too ""by the book"" and got a bit email-happy with hr early on, and would send emails roughly weekly, ccing in whoever it was about, reporting coworker x for saying she was going to vote on her way home (not allowed to talk about politics) and coworker y saying he was going to his niece's confirmation (not allowed to talk about religion) and stuff like that. we all just collectively stopped talking to her so she no longer had ammo for hr. she eased up around the 3 or 4 month mark when she realised it was making her pretty unpopular, but people were still cautious around her. me, julie, anna and a couple other guys who work in different parts of the office are the only people still here who were here for that, and we're still cautious around her even though she hasn't emailed hr in a while. anna has previously tried to befriend us and she's apologised for her actions in the past, but we still aren't her biggest fans. anna's desk has the same set up as ours but she doesn't have a desk-mate because hers retired a few months ago and they haven't replaced her yet, and since then anna has been trying to talk to us over lunch or while we're working. we've tried to keep it professional, asking if she has a certain form or if she got my (work related) email, or stuff like that, but she wants to talk about outside of work and generally get to know us. we're cautious about this because of what happened when she started working here.

&#x200b;

also i know i could have said ""i'm not naming my child joseph"" and been done with it but first off i'm not going to promise not to use it for the sake of a coworker i don't get on with and also it is in the running, as a middle name, along with a few other options, in the 50% possibility that i get pregnant with a boy.",3
"if i back out of being maid of honor at my best friends wedding next weekend? best man is my ex fiance who cheated on me and i can't be around him let alone walk arm in arm with him.. jump into the worst week of my life. i was with my ex fiance for 6 years. loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for august. refused a job offer so could move with him for his next air force assignment. monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) i text back she must have wrong number. she says she doesn't. in a moment of brains i pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. i'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. 

i confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. i consider it for half a second and say no. cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of std tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who i loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. 

and on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll ""make it up to me."" 

i've never hated a human being as much as i hate him. i can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. i understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because i'm upset. so i just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. 

woukd i be the asshole if i back out of the wedding?

edit: wow i checked out for a few hours to try and sleep and this exploded. i'm so sorry i haven't been reading i'll try and catch up

edit 2: ok guys i don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or nta and said i should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. i'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from ""panama"" where she said ""remember, you liked tounging my asshole?"" so when i get sad i have an instant reminder of who he really is. and then when it's all over i'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. if i can update a week from now i will. i still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.

"for calling off my wedding because my stbh asked for a prenup?. he makes close to 200k a year while i make 50k a year. my family is dead broke, his family is loaded. i've never asked him for money or to pay my bills. he's the one who wants to do pay for everything and gets mad at me if i pay a bill using my money. we even argued about when we have kids, he wants me to stay home while i want to work. i love my job. i'm frugal. i haven't been to a mall in 15 years and shop at big lots or dollar tree. i've never got attached to his wealth.

\-i don't want him to grow up thinking he's entitled to order me or anyone else to cook special meals for him.

\-i do season my food and cook it in other ways besides steaming or boiling.

"for refusing to pay for thousands for something my child broke?. i live in a pretty small town, so if you don't know somebody directly, you're likely to know a person who knows them, and this is pretty much biting me in the ass right now.

my husband and i are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. about a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. super bright, very loud, apparently very fragile and pretty much right out in the open. when i saw her touching it i told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. now, i'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but i felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.

a so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding i pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). i'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people i know think i'm in the wrong here. i personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. i also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, i think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them. whose the asshole here?",3

"for keeping my grandmothers ring when it was given to me by ""mistake""?. my grandmother passed earlier this year and she had a pretty nice jewelry collection. before she passed she knew what went to who and had had me meet to see what i'd like. instead of jewelry i asked for her wedding dress. no one else wanted it, i had gotten married in it, and she was really touched. after talking to her kids she went ahead and gave it to me before passing. 

when she did pass away i was surprised she hadn't written down who got what pieces. since i had already passed on inheritance of a piece i didn't go to the meeting with the rest of the family. basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. from what i heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. 

since i wasn't there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. it was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. it was sweet of them to do that, so i could have a piece of her everyday too. 

when i got the ring i didn't examine it. it was big enough i thought it was fake too. but then i saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating leo diamonds). i took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. it's value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). essentially i got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. but they chose it for me. 

now, they want to redo the distribution. but i feel like it's fair. i didn't ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. if i refuse?

"for forbidding my wife to go to her affair partner's funeral?. married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  in our second year of marriage my wife went home when i was deployed and slept with some dickhead (who i'll refer to as sd from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  she hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  sd and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.

&#x200b;

the reason i didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after i got home.  and she didn't try to justify it with the ""oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah"".  no she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though i agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.

&#x200b;

she immediately cut off all contact with sd and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that i was right to keep her.

&#x200b;

well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from sd's mother that sd died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.

&#x200b;

my wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like i got kicked right in the dick.  i instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. all those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  the pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.

&#x200b;

i asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  she keeps saying shit like ""it's the right thing to do"" and ""she just wants to pay respects"".

&#x200b;

i can't stop repeating that i'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and i'm re-living all those shitty nights i was sure our family would be shattered and i would only see my daughter 50% of the time.

edit 2: i apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as sd, because that's what he was.  fuck 'im.

a lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean i have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point i can see myself walking away if she insists on going.  we're going to counseling starting tomorrow",3
"for saying i wont pay for my daughters education if she switches her major?. as i said in my title, last night i sat my daughter down and told her that if she switches her major i will cease her tuition payments.

my daughter is currently a freshman in college. she has just started her first semester and i'm the one paying the bill. i have been saving for over 10 years to do this and i am happy to do it, as long as i feel she is actually setting herself up for success. during high school my daughter my daughter fell in love with computers. she took ever class she could on programming and computer science and declared that her major going into school. i supported her through all this because i thought this is what she loved and felt it set her up for a good job after school.

this last week she was on fall break so she came to stay with me over the weekend after spending a few days at my ex's house. my daughter yesterday morning decided to casually drop that she's planning on changing majors. i was shocked by this and asked why and what she was changing to. she is planning on switching into the liberal arts program. now i know the major is the go to punching bag and it feels cliche, but i was honestly a little shocked by how casually she acted about this. when i tried to get why she was switching all i got was that she all of the sudden hates computer science and has made multiple friends who are majoring in la. apparently she has been talking with the councilors up there as well and they along with her friends have all recommended she switch majors.

i tried to ask her the regular stuff ""what about your future"", ""how do you plan to get a job"", etc. and she decided to ignore me and tell me that it's none of my business and that she's an adult. this angered me. i'm the one paying for this i feel i have a right to know and not be blown off like that. i thought over it all day and so last night i sat her down and told her that while yes, she is an adult. i am the one paying for her education and i won't be paying for her to get what is in my opinion a worthless degree. i told her if she doesn't want to do cs that's fine. but she needs to put more thought into the change and find something that she enjoys and can get her a career. and if in the end she decides that she's an ""adult"" and she wants to be a liberal arts major. she can pay for it like an adult should, with her own money.

this did not sit well with her. we fought and she left saying i'm trying to control her life with money and am being a major asshole. my ex called me up after and told me that i'm no better than a dictator right now and that i'm using her college fund as ransom for her to do what i want.

all i want is for my daughter to have a good life and job prospects. here?

edit:

wow, did not expect this.

i have read a good amount of the responses on here and through the people who have messaged me. before i say anything else let me clarify my position a bit because i see the same question sent to me and i don't feel like responding to hundreds of people individually.

i do not have a problem with my daughter getting a la degree.

if my daughter called me up now and gave me her reasons for switching and a legitimate plan for how she will use this degree to secure a career, i would support her 100%. i don't care what my daughter does with her life. i just want her to do something with her life. i am looking to spend over one hundred thousand dollars over the next 4 years. the least i feel i can ask of my daughter is to have a plan in mind before she decides to make changes on my dime. i get that young adults who go to college are using this as a avenue to find themselves and explore. and many of you have told me that i should not treat this as setting her up for a career, and instead treat this as a ""academic experience"" to teach her life lessons. for those two last points, i feel you are wrong.

this money that i have saved is not a ""gift"". this is what i have saved for 10 years to make sure that she has opportunities that me my ex never had. this is my investment in her. for people who claim that i should be throwing my money at her no questions asked and support her, i respectfully disagree. giving my daughter money for free, in my opinion, is the worst thing i could do for her right now. supporting her as she makes a choice she has given me no justification for that will cost me thousands of dollars will kill me. and the fact that she seems to think that i am owed no explanation and that i should ""mind my own business because she's an adult"" is an insult to the investment i am making in her.

i am not arguing whether or not i am wrong. if you all feel i am an asshole for this, then i will accept that.

&#x200b;

i called my daughter and left a message saying that i wish to talk with her about this and that i feel we left off in a bad place and wish to talk about this more. if my daughter wants to go into la, then that is her choice. weather or not i pay for it will be mine.",3
"for kicking my husband out of the house because he lied to me about money. my husband hid $1500 (some insurance payout) from me and he played the whole ""i don't have money for gas"" victim part. this money is not part of our savings or anything. anyway, he had been hiding the money for 2 weeks. during those two weeks i bought groceries for us, i paid for our take out food, i offered to pay for his broken windshield, and overall i was concerned about whether or not he had enough money for himself. he saw me struggle putting to put gas in my truck. he let me pay for his car insurance. he heard my concerns and my offers to help him and he did not once tell me not to worry.

yesterday i asked him to lend me $20 because a friend invited me somewhere last minute and i didn't have cash. he got really nervous when i asked him if i could borrow his debit card. he started to act strange. i asked him if he was hiding something from me and he called me crazy and accused me of not believing him. i asked him if he was hiding money from me? and he denied it and said i was paranoid and crazy.

he checked his bank account in front of me and acted surprised. he literally shouted, ""wow wow wow i have extra money!!!! oh my god this is so awesome!!"" and he played the whole i didn't know part.

he continued to argue and i told him that i don't care about the money i care about honesty. why did he lie? and if he can lie so blatantly about this then he can lie (or has lied) about many things.

it took a whole day for him to finally confess that he was hiding the money from me because supposedly i was going to ask for some money if i knew. he said he felt guilty for not telling about it when he saw me struggle with money.

today i asked him to leave the house. i called him cruel and deceitful. i told him that i don't want to be with someone that can lie so blatantly.

by the way i'm 6 months pregnant with a very wanted and planned baby. we've know each other for 3 years.

am i the as*hole for leaving him over this? 
i'm just so hurt by how easily he lied and called me crazy and paranoid. and now i'm questioning everything in our relationship. maybe his gym sessions are time that he spends with women. i don't know anything anymore.

***update****
i followed the advice i received here (thank you). he's back home but staying in the guest room. he came back with a brand new baby car seat (guilt?) and he's apologizing profusely. we'll be taking marriage counseling.",3
"for pointing out that my co-worker is trans/doesn't pass?. alright.

i'm a european woman in her mid-twenties who recently moved to san francisco for a fancy-pants internship. it was a huge culture shock, but in a way, a welcome one- i'm gay (the very girly type people don't really clock as gay, but still) and this is the first time i've ever been out at work.

there is one co-worker who we shall call linda. she's a trans woman (mtf).

linda's position means that me and she and i don't really interact at work often. therefore, i was told about her before i met her. one of my co-workers told me that she existed, i was due to meet her next week, and that she was a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. i met linda, didn't even ask for her pronouns and just used she/her, everything went alright, i thought that was the end of it.

now, linda does not pass as a cis woman.  she's still a woman and i'd never misgender her, but it is objectively visible that this is probably a trans woman, not a cis one.

this now caused an issue. a few of us had a halloween get-together and invited linda. at some point, she and i were alone at our table. we got talking about what it was like for me being this very girly gay woman in a male-dominated field in a conservative european country. at some point, i made a remark along the lines of 'but of course, you as a trans woman probably faced similar experiences'.

her face just fell. she started hissing at me about how dare i presume she's trans, she hasn't been misgendered (i did not misgender her, at no point did i use 'he' or anything like that- i just said she was trans, which...she is) in years, and no one at work has ever had to ask for her pronouns etc. drunk idiot i was, i blurted out 'but...we all know?' which we do.

i was extremely confused. apparently, out of the younger group of co-workers, no one ever actually asked her for her pronouns or gender identity because we all, just like me, got told by some colleague who'd been there longer that this was a trans woman who uses female pronouns. this somehow led linda to believe that we didn't 'clock' her, which was a huge source of self-esteem for her.

linda now, and i say this without a hint of exaggeration, hates my guts. she confided to another coworker that she's extremely hurt by me pointing out that she doesn't pass and that it was invasive and rude and how dare i judge her. i, on the other hand, don't really know what the hell happened here. she is trans, that is a fact of life, everyone knows and it is clearly visible.

for saying what i said?",3
"aita: i ditched a girl 40 minutes from her house on our first date. i know the title already sounds like i'm a major asshole, but there is a few more variables that need to be discussed before you make your decision. 

also, this is a throwaway acct for obvious reasons

so i meet a girl on tinder named ""kim"" and we exchange a few messages before deciding to meet up for coffee.

the date is going ok, although it was a bit boring, we grabbed our cup of starbucks (i paid) we chatted for a bit and decided to drive to a cool little outdoor park to go for a walk. 

we drive around 30 mins to this park, listened to a bit of music on the way, still getting to know each other a bit and everything was going fine. 

i parked, we got out of the car and walked a bit, still chatting, nothing deep, but the usual what you do for work, hobbies etc etc.

i had to take a leak, so i go to the bathroom and when i walked out, i noticed she was talking to a guy and he was being very flirty and when i walked up to them, he asked who i was and she responded: ""oh he's just my friend hahaha"" and he said he wanted to grab her number to go out for a drink sometime. she was all too happy to give him the number and they hug with a kiss on the cheek before he leaves. 

at this point i was just over it. i wasn't that interested in her and if she's the type of person to show interest in another guy and exchange info in front of me i have no future with her.

i decided to make up some random excuse to get away from her and just got in my car and drove home. i didn't want to have to deal with her company for a 40 minute drive and was over it. 

oh well, i honestly feel like a bit of an asshole, but also feel it was just in a sense considering what happened....",3
"for refusing to support my wife through her diagnosis after her infidelity. my wife and i had a pretty normal marriage. no kids, both employed and really happy together. for 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. 

she recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. the first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. dinner went well, came home and went to bed. wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after i had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.

we talked, yelled, cried. i spent most of the night sick. told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. i've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.

before this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. turns out we were wrong, as i was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. i got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. she was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. i told her i wished her all the best, i'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while i'd help financially from a distance, i wasn't physically going back.

they (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. my own friends are split 50/50. i don't want to go back. before anyone pulls the ""this is probably why she cheated!"" card, no. we had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. we were solid. she just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. she never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. while i certainly don't think anyone deserves this and i am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. i feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing i won't forgive her when it's over. it feels like prolonging the inevitable, and i feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. she has family and friends so she isn't alone. i care about the woman i thought i married, but i no longer love who she turned out to be, so i feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. i'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. aita?

**edit**: to the reddit detectives further down. when i said ""we talk every month"" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. we talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. secondly, i mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when i was told i didn't believe it, i figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment i left. i also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. as far how she cheated the ""entire"" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. and i figured this would be easy to figure out but i guess not, i knew her friend forced her to tell me because i demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. finally, i know a lot of people post made up stories. i'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details i can't prove it. if i wanted karma i wouldn't be on a throwaway, i posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable i think it's time for neutral third party judgement and i was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided. to the mods, i'm sorry this post wasn't a great fit here. i'll post in the appropriate subs in the future.",3
"for sending my kid to school with ""adult"" snacks and lunches?. living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. i have a second grader who i have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. 

she came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more ""appropriate"" snacks and lunches. i thought for a minute that maybe i accidentally grabbed one of my quest bars or something for her and asked my daughter.

for her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. my daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, i put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. the teacher commented on it.

lunchtime came around, and i guess a similar thing happened. my kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week i made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and i guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. this is what sparked the note. 

so i explained that she shouldn't share ""spicy"" foods with her friends, and figured i'd skip the pickles next time. well, it wasn't good enough. just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send ""age appropriate"" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a pb & j, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.

i called the teacher and asked her about the note. teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is ""a little kid"" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating ""adult food"" yet. i asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said ""no"" and ""this really shouldn't be a big deal.""

this might be where i fucked up. i told the teacher that i'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. that when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, i will continue to send my kid to school with the foods i pick. teacher got huffy and hung up. 

just to double check, i asked my daughter two things: does she like her lunches? (enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and ""are the other kids making fun of you?"" because i know that can be an issue. she said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. 

so aita, or is this teacher way out of line?",3
"for giving my concert ticket to another girl after my friend said she only wanted to go with me as ""friends""?. i am 24m and i have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. she is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. i have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. lately i feel like i've been getting vibes that she likes me back.

last week i won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. she also happens to like this singer so i asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. i said i can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. she said she'd love to go, but only as friends. she says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. she told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. i said i'll think about it. i was quite hurt because honestly i don't have much experience with rejection, and i was annoyed that she turned me down. 

today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. she immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. still, i'm taking her out for drinks on friday. but just now, the friend who i asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. i told her honestly that i already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.

when i told my sister about what happened, she said i'm being really douchy. she says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and i should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. i said she can't understand because she's not a dude. because let's me honest, if i had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my ""friend"" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously i'm taking the second one. for just being honest about what i want?

**edit**: because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: yes i would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. nowhere do i even say that we have to share a bed...

but the part where she says she's not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. she likely said she'll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. so why would i make the experience awkward for the both of us when i could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **edit over**",3
"for forcing my son to see how difficult it is to raise a baby?. my son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. he is only 17 and she is 16. i told him i was proud that he came forward to tell me, but i didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. according to him, having a child is ""easy"" and not ""really that hard"". we tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.

since then, the house has been quite tense. any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. i have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. since my son told us they were pregnant, i have done the following:

1. i wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. i open the door, scream as loud as i can until i know he is awake, and i shut the door. i've done this 5 nights in a row.
2. i purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. i have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, i shut off the internet until he changes it. i will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.
3. while playing one of his games, i told him his ""baby"" wanted to be held. giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. i placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. while he was doing this, i went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. i told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.
4. i have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. when he presses me for a reason, i tell him ""you dont have a babysitter. you can go if you take your sack of flour with you."" he has not gone anywhere in a week.
5. yesterday, i did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. i told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. this was the last straw for him.

after his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. he told me i am being completely unrealistic. i reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything i have done so far he has done to me in the past.

his mother tells me i am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but i don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. if anything, i want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.

tell me the truth; am i being too much of an asshole here?",3
"for removing the stereo faceplate from my car before a long (3+ hours) drive because my gf wouldn't stop muting it to take/make phone calls?. to preface this i think i might have overreacted because honestly? i can't stand driving. i hate it. but i gotta get places and where i live that means driving.

little bit of info first, my car is an older car with the stereo that you can change the faceplate, like the buttons and stuff. a few years ago i sent it to a mechanic friend for a tune-up and he put bluetooth in it as a gift.

i occasionally(usually averages out to once or twice every 2-3 months) have to drive several hours to see a specialist for a medical condition i've had since i was born. over the last year or so my gf(r) has started to come with me, which i appreciate very much because i know hospitals bring back a lot of not-good memories for her.

for the issue at hand. r is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told ""this is important"", or ""i need to hear this"". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.

it drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.

she's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.

edit: to answer some faqs, she doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.

i always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, dr death, ymh, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. i love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when i'm allowed to listen again

i can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.

i've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for that long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. i never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.

after thinking about it and how i felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and i feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. i'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough.",3
"for sending an explicit video my ex sent to me to hurt me to her family. hi aita. i am going to try to make this as brief as possible so i don't ramble.

&#x200b;

i dated em for a year and a half. during this time i confided in her some personal secrets, which i don't feel comfortable sharing even anonymously. because of these she knows that there are certain things, related to sex mostly, that i am very sensitive towards.

&#x200b;

we did not part on friendly terms after our breakup and we don't talk anymore. i broke up with her because i found out she cheated on me, and she flipped out. recently i found out that she is seeing one of my coworkers, and that he is spreading rumors about me that she told him. she basically told him bits and pieces of the personal information i shared with her when we were together and now he's spreading some of that around the office.

&#x200b;

i sent her a message telling her to stop spreading my secrets around and to leave me alone. she replied sending me explicit videos of herself having sex with my coworker because she knew it would hurt me. that was the last straw for me, and i sent the video to all of her family and friends with the message that ""this is what em sends me when i ask her to leave me alone and stop spreading rumors.""

&#x200b;

her familly is quite religious and they lost it. apparently, they pulled their financial support for her college and arent speaking with her atm. aita?

&#x200b;

tl:dr my ex sent me unsolicited sexual videos when i asked her to leave me alone. i sent them to her family. aita?

&#x200b;

edit: well this blew up. i'll try and answer some of the things i have seen asked most often here:

&#x200b;

1: i feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that i have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. to put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, i was a victim of csa for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. it led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that i struggle with to this day (i never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that i've done that i'd like to not have spread around). she has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.

&#x200b;

2: by all of her friends and family, i meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. i worded that terribly. i have not been in the best headspace as of late. sorry.

&#x200b;

3: we have not spoken since. i have no desire to speak to her ever again. my coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and i have not heard anything from him. as petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all i care. i have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. maybe i am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. i feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.

&#x200b;

4: i will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. i have the money to fight a legal case if i have to, though obviously, i would rather not.

&#x200b;

yeah. that pretty much the main things i wanted to clear up. i'll go through the thread tomorrow if i feel up to it and see if there's anything else. it's a bit of a shitshow and i'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm",3
"if i didn't give up my honey moon villa to my grandparents?. my family is asian, my husbands side is white.

my husband and i got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our ""real"" one. 
we were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. my husband and i took the villa.

the bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. we made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. 

our villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. 

we have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. during dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. my grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. 

well, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to ""slave"" and live as ""peasants"" while their grandchildren get a nicer room. 

this is bora bora we're talking about. no one is living as a peasant here. 

there was only 1 villa available in our section. had i given it to my grandparents i think it would've been offensive to my husbands grandparents. if there was 3, we would've given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. but unfortunately, there wasn't. i mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.

i obviously objected, and said i felt as though my husband and i should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate our marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? wouldn't one just sit back and be grateful they're on a free vacation instead of complaining?

my grandparents freaked out. saying i'm holding money above their head and that i'm being disrespectful and not following their orders. they stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. 

idk what to do. my side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and i agree. they are so ridiculous. all i wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it's falling apart. 

i don't think i'm the asshole at all, but i've been up all night thinking wether i should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. but another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. 

so reddit, what do i do? if i denied giving up my villa?



***update***
even though i really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, i decided it'd be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that i was disrespectful.

during breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if i was there. everyone tried calling them-nope we're not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. after a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. 

i made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. they said they hadn't looked yet and that should be my job if i was kicking them out?? i made sure they knew i was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. 

they kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. 

well, i'm not doing that. 
i'll pay for their flight back home, but i've already done enough accommodating on my honeymoon vacation. 

so there you have it. my grandparents weren't even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. i called their bluff. 

after breakfast, i found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. they also didn't get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. 

staff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. my cousins came over and honestly couldn't care less my grandparents are gone, in their words ""they kill the vibe"". so everyone's happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. 

i'm happy i was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. 

i have an overflow of messages and comments, that i can't get back to. however, the main question is what my profession is. 

i did not go the usual asian route. i actually dropped out my last year of college and started a fashion line that took a couple years to take off, but surprisingly sky rocketed a few years ago. my dad is also an entrepreneur, i looked up to him and am so glad i had him as an inspiration who paved the way. don't give up on your dreams.",3
"for refusing to meet my wife's ex-boyfriend?. my wife stays in contact with her ex who she dated for 5 years before meeting me. all they do is text each other occasionally, which i have no problem with. i explained to her early on that i am not interested in ever meeting or befriending any of her exes. she agreed and it was never an issue until now.

her ex has moved back to the city where we live and she really wants him and i to meet. once again i explained to her that i have zero interest in such a meeting. i see no point to it, i don't need his blessing or approval, and i have enough friends. plus the whole idea just seems awkward. 

she explained that it would mean a lot to her if i would just meet with him. i asked why and her response was that it will keep his mind at ease knowing that she is with someone good. i snapped a little but didn't raise my voice and asked her: *""since when does his wants and concerns matter in our marriage?""* 

she didn't have answer for this and simply asked me to think about it. i know my answer is not going to change and i am honestly quite angry about this whole thing. aita? also any advice is much appreciated.

thank you.

**p.s**

i don't care if they meet occasionally to catch up, but i think i'll be getting a divorce if they start hanging out on the regular. i love my wife but i don't think i have her heart. he was her longest relationship aside from me and she lost her virginity to him.

**edit**

with regards to divorcing her over this:

> i'd rather divorce her than control her. i didn't tell her that i would do this, it will simply happen. i can control what i do (not meeting him), but i cannot control what she does. it would be better to part ways instead of turning the marriage into a toxic swamp.",3
"if i talk to my 18 yo brother about age of consent against my mothers wishes?. my brother is 18. he has a 15 year old girlfriend. age of consent where he lives is 16. they are both in highschool, he is a senior, she is a junior.

to my knowledge, he is still a virgin. he does know the basics about sexual health, pregnancy, prevention, and std prevention. another thing my mother and i butt heads about but she gave in on that one.

my mother refused to talk to him about the fact that if they were to engage in a sexual relationship, it would be illegal in my home state. she said he is innocent and he's not sexually active. it wasn't necessary. i implored her to change her mind because things can progress very quickly and he needed to know.

last night i called my brother and discussed it with him myself. i didnt try to scare him, just gave him facts. he also told me they haven't done anything yet. i told him that if sex was something they are considering, they should wait until after her birthday in 3 months. i told him that sex can happen at their own pace when they are ready.  i also mentioned was not for or against him having sex, only that i wanted him to wait until he wouldn't get in trouble.

i tried really hard to give a respectful but informative talk. my mother is pissed that i talked to him about it when she told me no.

for wanting my brother to be informed and safe?

edit: if it matters, i'm his sister and i am 26. i live out of state. 

edit: he lives in ct since a bunch of people have asked. i mentioned in a few comments, but now it's here too.

edit: thank you so much for the input and support. i'm going to have a follow up conversation with him about sexting and exchanging pictures also consent as a whole. i had missed that topic on the earlier conversation. also big thank you for the gold! this is my first. 

edit: i am overwhelmed by how much this has blown up! gold, silver, platinum, and on the front page?! thank you!",3
"update: if i cancelled our wedding?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cuvkw3/wibta_if_i_cancelled_our_wedding/

tldr at the bottom! 

hello, all! it's been some time since i laid out all the bullshit my fiance and i were dealing with in regards to planning our wedding and such. we were so overwhelmed with the immense response and support, so, thank you to everyone who contributed and offered advice. now, on to what happened! 

my fiance and i talked it through, the pros and cons, etc. we both realized how unhappy we were with how things were going and decided that we were going to cancel the wedding and move forward with eloping. we decided that we didn't want it to be just us, but a small group of family and friends as well. we were both ecstatic, but, also extremely worried at how our parents were going to take it. especially considering our guest list went from over 120 people, to 20. but, we were both committed and he decided to tell his parents and i would then tell mine. 

surprisingly, his parents were so supportive and extremely ecstatic that we were getting eloped. they were even more excited when we let them know we wanted them there and they booked their flight soon after! they also handled telling their families and friends in texas that we were eloping and to get over it. so, that saved us the trouble! his other family was very supportive and wished us the best. my father also was incredibly supportive and couldn't wait to be there. my mother on the hand, was furious.

the phone call to her started off calmly enough and i did let her know before beginning the conversation that she most likely wouldn't enjoy this. but, i pressed forward. i told her our reasons, our stresses, how we felt disrespected and disregarding concerning everything, i laid it all out in a calm and collected manner. once finished, she was very quite and simply said, alright. i knew immediately that i was pretty well fucked, but, we ended the phone call with her stating she understood. 

less than 24 hours later, she texts me asking if my brother (whom one of our biggest stressors was about) was invited. i was pissed because i had just had this conversation with her and explicitly told her who was invited and etc. i responded back with a simple no and that my father, grandmother and herself were invited. well, shit hit the fan.

she sent me a wall of texts, calling me all sorts of names, throwing my fiance's family in my face and how we took their side, how i never truly gave a shit about her feelings, all the good stuff. i remained calm and before sending each response, consulted my fiance as to not sound like a total bitch. long story short, she said unless my brother is invited, she won't be coming. so, i told her not to come. i was over it and stopped responding to her texts. 

for days she texted me, saying all the same as before and kept asking if my brother was invited. i responded once and told her that until she apologized (she won't) that i wouldn't be seeing or speaking to her about anything regarding the wedding. i offered an open seat to our wedding, whether she shows or not, is completely up to her. 

my fiance and i have already booked a small venue for our elopment and are more excited planning this than our previous wedding and are looking forward to our future! 

tldr: we are eloping, bitches!

edit; since everyone here has become a dictionary for the word ""elopement"", take it however you like. small wedding/elopement, i don't care. i'm marrying the love of my life in the way i want, so, i won either way 👍",3
"for buying the dress that my friend wanted but couldn't get because they don't have it in plus size?. i and my friends are going to be bridesmaids in our friend's wedding, and for the past few weeks we've been searching online for bridesmaids dresses and sharing links of dresses we like in our group chat so none of us ends up buying the same or very similar dresses. my friend ana sent a link for a green bateau dress and literally said ""i love this but they don't have it in my size."" (she is us 14.)

i agreed that the dress is beautiful while one of our other friends said that the skirt might be too wide for a bridesmaid dress. ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group's conversation moved along. 

yesterday ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. i really liked the green bateau dress so i checked if they had it in my size (i am us 8) and they did so i told our group that i was going to order the bateau dress. no one replied immediately, but i didn't think too much about it because it's not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. i ordered the dress.

a few hours later i got a call from one of my friends saying that ana called her and was upset that i ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn't buy it because it wasn't available in her size. my friend said ana thinks i'm trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that i can wear the dress she likes because i'm skinnier. 

to be honest i have mixed emotions about what ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so i tried calling ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that i didn't intend for her to feel that way. but she hasn't answered my calls or messages. 

so i just want to know: for thinking that there is nothing wrong with buying the dress ana liked but couldn't buy because they didn't have it in her size in the first place, or is my friend overreacting?",3
"aitah for letting my coworkers quit because i got fired?. a regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking at the bar i worked at for over 10 years, i worked there for 4 years. i made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought i was taking one. i just want to make extra money.

my manager happened to see this on the cameras. there is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it's a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.

there is no way to prove there wasn't booze in my shot, i saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove i didn't put liquor in that shot.

i honestly don't and didn't care enough to argue with her about it. i'm about to start a new job since i graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.

i trained basically every new person at this bar, and i was honest with them that i was fired in our work group chat. they all started saying if you got fired for that we don't want to work here either. they were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.

i told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. i said i'm going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink anything out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it. i also told them to think for themselves and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.

i then let my anger overtake me and i said ""if you want to find a job where you don't have to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane manager find different bartending and serving jobs. you're all capable people that don't deserve a psycho watching over you when you've put good time into a work place."" i basically contradicted myself. 

i feel like i went over the top, my sister said i should've kept my mouth shut. but i explained the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the ""mix things together to look like booze so people don't feel rejected when they buy you shots trick"". she thinks it's crazy the new manager won't trust me after training so many people in and my old manager loves me.

my old manager quit because she was moving away with her fiance, but she told the new manager that i was trustworthy and i thought the new manager would have some trust considering i was basically running the bar when she came in. 

whatever the case, aitah for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? because as of now 7/10 bartenders where i was fired from are planning a group quit. i don't want the bar to close, but i want my manager to realize that she messed up...",3

"for telling my mother-in-law that she can't control how i act in my home?. my mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. it's been ok. she and i are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. she is a traditional hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. i am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.

before, out of consideration to my spouse and out of a belief in the my ""my house, my rules adage,"" i used to watch what i said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. but when my spouse asked if she could live with us, i said i was okay with it as long as i no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. my spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. i don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.

last week, my 10-year-old and i were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. we were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. we are very mature, i know. but when i said, ""i fart in your general direction!"" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in spanish, ""don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. i will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer."" and i said, in english (i can understand spanish but can't speak it well), ""this is my home. you don't get a say in how i interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act."" she stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.

my spouse says ita because i embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because i expected her to accept too much, too quickly. they also say that i am being a little culturally insensitive and that i need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how i spoke to her, so i need to apologize. but i think it was important for her to see that i will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that i won't be policed in my own home.",3
"for removing all the cutlery and dishes in my shared apartment?. i have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only i can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. all the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but i told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.

things worked pretty well at first but over time i caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. after the third or so time i sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. they all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and i told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.

i came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. i see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead i just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. after this during the middle of the night i took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. it took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. 

queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. queue bitching. queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". i don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. i'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when i regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think i'm an ass for good now and i had only created an awkward situation that won't go.

i have no regrets, and i don't think i'm an ass, but given i lurk this sub a lot i'm curious for your verdict in this matter. aita?",3
"for exploding on my father's wife. throwaway  

hear me out on this one.

in regards to ages, i'm 17, dad is 43, and father's wife 27 or 28.

six years ago, it came out during couple's therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. my mom initiated divorce. six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. my dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day i can truly forgive him.

i do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father's wife, i begrudgingly show respect. i have never called her out of her name until later in this story. if she speaks to me, i will say something back. if i am in her home, i will clean up after myself. however, i will always refer to her as my father's wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. this is something she cannot accept.

i have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. while at my father' house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying ""the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,"" and said that i was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why i would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. i guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

she then revealed that when my dad gets back from his tdy (temporary duty assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say ""don't mess with her,"" with her 2-month-old daughter. i have never been in any of the previous family portraits because i refused to and my dad said i didn't have to.

i told her i was not going to participate

she asked why i was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

six years' worth of hurt came out. i told her she was a fool to ever think i was her child or that i considered her family. from my perspective, she was nothing, but my father's racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. i took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn't my father's child because she looks nothing like him.

she turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful i was and i had no right to talk to her in such a manner. i fully admit i called her a bitch and stated she didn't even deserve any respect from me because she didn't respect my mother's marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. after realizing what i had said, i left and haven't talked to her since.

everyone that i have talked to say i should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and i don't mind doing that.  however, certain people say i shouldn't have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

so who is the asshole?",3
"for refusing to fire our maid (at my wife's request). **edit:** well fuck me i just spoke with my maid. she says she hasn't seen my wife cheating but that she came home a couple of weeks ago and found my wife having a glass of wine and lying on the couch with a guy she's never seen before. from her description i've never heard of him either. she kept it to herself as she assumed it was just a close friend of my wife. 

i guess this thread serves no purpose and will get locked now. so before that happens just want to thank those of you that brought this possibility to my attention. honestly thought my marriage was perfect i never in a million years suspected my wife would be unfaithful.

--- 

my wife and i have 5 kids together, ranging from 2 - 15. my wife is a stay at home mom while i work a full time (8am to 7pm, 5 days a week) job. 

we live in hong kong where it's the norm to have a maid (or ""domestic helper"" as they're called here) rather than being limited to rich. our maid is a 34 year old filipino woman that has been working for us since she was 19 years old. she lives with us in her own room and gets weekends off. 

the problem is that my wife wants us to fire our maid. she hasn't given any specific reason other than ""i don't want a maid anymore."" i honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but i don't want to fire her because:

- she has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point

- she relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it

- we still have an infant/young children that require constant attention

- i work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. my wife doesn't cook nor clean so i am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is gone

the woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and i don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.

i'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. jealousy does not seem to be the case here.

"for telling my wife to get out of bed and feed the damn cat.. alright everyone, i need some judgement on this one...

my wife and i have a happy, healthy (no chonkers) cat that we love except for on weekends when he will sit outside our bedroom door and meow non stop until one of us gets up to feed him. this only happens on weekends.

monday-friday my wife wakes up for work first at around 6:00 am and feeds the cat. however on weekends we both try to sleep in, so come 6:01 am our kitty alarm clock goes off and won't shut up until one of us gets up to feed him. he will literally cry for 2 hours straight if we try to ignore him.

here's where the story takes a twist. awhile back we bought a timed self feeder to use when we are away for vacations. when we tested out the self feeder we discovered the amazing benefit of the cat no longer crying to us for food because he gets fed at his usual time each morning. i thought this was fabulous and we should use the self feeder all the time to save our sleep sanity.

my wife disagreed. her reasons range from:

concerned that the self feeder might not drop the correct amount of food each time.

concerned the cat might be able to reach his little murder mitten up the food chute and steal extra food between meals.

concerned the cat won't ""love"" us anymore since we aren't the ones directly pouring his food into his dish.

concerned it's a waste of batteries.

i've told my wife i understand all of her concerns but i still think the benefit of being able to sleep in without being woken up by a cat banshee outweighs the risks she has laid out. she still disagrees.

so i did the only thing that reddit hates more in relationships than cheating and gave my wife an ultimatum! 

i told her that we either use the self-feeder or come 6:01 am saturday morning when the cat wakes us both up, i'm kicking her (not litterally) out of bed to go feed the damn cat.

so reddit, aita?

edit: i'm seeing a lot of people proposing the compromise of using the self feeder just on weekends. unfortunately my wife has shot that idea down in the past too.

edit 2: many people have been demanding i pay the ""cat tax"" and post a picture of the real ah in question. sadly i am a reddit failure and can't figure out how to attach a picture to the post. if anyone knows how to do this and can direct message me, i will gladly comply and pay the cat tax.

"for having an almanac?. a bit of backstory. i met my wife in the summer of 2008. she was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. i had gone to pick up some boxes because i was moving. out walked my sara...it was close to the end of her shift. and working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (seriously, i don't care what ddd says, that place is gross.) she was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...i'm pretty sure i fell in love right then and there that wonderful may night. (inb4 ""thats so old fashioned!!!"" don't care. when you know, you know.) i wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.
it started after our first date. she had mentioned she loves lilacs. me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know jack or shit about flowers. but the way she talked about how much she loved them i knew i didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. so i wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (think what cops use to take notes.) this was the almanacs genesis. over the years i've written down information about my wife. her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. basically all the little things i knew i would forget. anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. i would go through it every once in a while so i could do something sweet for her. fast forward to yesterday morning.
i get a call from her around 11am. ""what the fuck is the almanac?"" (the almanac is written on the cover. it's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) she obviously has it, and i don't lie to my wife, so i tell her. she gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says ""i always thought you remembered this stuff..."" tells me she has to run and hangs up. i get home from work last night and she's really dejected. i asked her what's wrong and she says the almanac has cheapened every sweet thing i've ever done for her. she called it my ""playbook"" and said she felt betrayed. mind you i've never showed it to a single soul nor have i even told anyone about it. until yesterday i was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (she also said she hasn't decided if i can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) i'm kind of heart broken. i feel like this should be an example of how much i love her. i'm terrified she's going to burn it. i want to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. that's why i write them down. i don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. i do it because i love my wife. i hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and i don't want to be that guy. so yeah, i took notes. and now i'm getting the silent treatment. or at best single word answers.

"for asking boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip he's taking without me?. sadly this is a serious question.

in an exclusive (not open) relationship for 8 months. bf 30s is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me also 30s over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. he wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. 

i saw the condoms in his clear ziploc bag (note: plainly visible, i did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course i asked about them. his response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.

reddit, i watched him combine otc meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. i don't think anything in his bag is in there by ""accident."" but now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like i ruined new year's for asking this. 

for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?

edit: he has never cheated previously, doesn't know anyone in this country and is going there for a fairly intensive field research project. i don't believe he has an active plan to cheat. i am, however, upset, because to me the act of bringing condoms is an active refusal to close the door on the possibility of intimacy with someone else if the opportunity happens to arise.",3
"for telling my friend i didn't appreciate paying for a $200 meal at her husband's birthday party?. my friend invited my husband and me to a 40th birthday party for her husband. the party was going to be at a fairly upscale restaurant with dancing afterwards. we've been working on some remodeling projects, so we've been on a strict budget. my husband and i wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.

when we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. when we were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. i asked a passing waiter if i could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. the waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.

my friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but i was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.

as the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend's husband with the check. my friend's husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, ""i know this isn't how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. we told you that."" i suddenly started panicking inside. i was trying to catch someone else's eye to see if they were panicking as much as i was. one other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. i opened the check, and the total was $211. i thought i was going to throw up. i have never spent that much on a meal.

i held my shit together because i didn't want to make a scene. the couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn't paying. they said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.

i ended up messaging her and said, ""thanks so much for inviting us to \*\*\*'s party. we had a great time. just a heads up for next time, we really need to know if going to a party is going to cost more than $100. we are on a really tight budget, so a heads up would be appreciated. thanks again.""

my friend said, ""sorry! should have given you a heads up. glad you came."" and we haven't spoken or hung out since. i've tried to set up coffee dates and girl's nights but she just bails or never responds. it's been almost 3 months, and she doesn't seem to want to talk to me at all.",3
"for calling a pregnant woman a c***?. i was at the bookstore the other day and as i approached the cash i saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. 

as i got closer i listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. she was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn't available at the store. she was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn't available. the girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and i could tell she felt bad. when the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a ""inconsiderate little bitch"". as the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said ""what's the point of customer service if they won't help you?"" 
at this point, i had felt horrible for the young girl and i knew i had to say something. so i looked at the woman and i said ""i just hope whatever you give birth to isn't a total c*** like his mom"". the woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. i said i didn't care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. she cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. he came in, didn't say much (i'm 6'2, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. as she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. 

now, i still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that i was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. i felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. the cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. she thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so i think she's ok. 

ps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. 

i still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying i was wrong in using the c word?

edit: a few people have mentioned that i should not have included the hijab comment. it was not my intention to mention her religion for brownie points, i meant that it was very upsetting to see her trying to hide the fact she was crying because she was so embarrassed, and she didn't even have the chance to get a kleenex because this woman was just relentlessly going after her. sorry if it came across as pandering. was not my intention.

"for thinking a divorce announcement due to an affair was an april fools joke?. let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


am i the asshole?

"for showering my niece?. obligatory  ""longtime lurker, first time poster"" disclaimer. also a heads up i personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that i feel like i'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what i actually did wrong. 

so last weekend i  25m was watching my niece 3f. i have a daughter 5f myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. on this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. what was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. seriously i went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when i came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. i immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. i helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while i washed hers. 

i thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly i didn't even think twice about doing it. my sil does not agree. she keeps saying that it's ""weird and creepy"" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that i should've called her to okay it first. that mindset is kinda confusing to me. like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who i always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of atlantis. plus, what was i supposed to do? let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? however, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when i'm a man and not her dad. are they right and i'm missing the point or am i right that there's nothing weird about it?

eta: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so i'll address them. 

1. my daughter's mother is dead and i'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. 

2. idk if my sil was abused. will throw out there though that i was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and i as kids.

3. i was *not* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think i was. i never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. 

4. yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.

5. thanks whoever gave me silver.",3
"for taking care of my dad financially against my wife's wishes?. i'm m35, my wife is f28, we've been married for 3 years now. my dad is 65 and retired now with a small but decent pension, my mom passed away when i was 10 and my dad never remarried and never had another relationship to my knowledge. he raised me and my sister by himself and worked 3 jobs for over 10 years to support my sister and i through university. my dad is the hardest working person i've ever known and heard of, he is my inspiration and my hero. he was born in a tin hut in rural bangladesh and came to canada with nothing and worked tirelessly everyday to help himself out. i am very successful and have been taking care of my dad since i graduated uni and i provide him with about $1,000 a month and my sister who's a social worker gives him about $300. his house is paid off and i paid for a full renovation to his place this year which my wife wasn't too happy about but his place needed major work. 

my wife came to me last week and suggested i stop giving my dad 1k a month as he now gets a small pension from work and an old age pension from the govt and he basically has no bills except for minimal utilities, food, gas on a benz i bought him for his 65th bday and personal stuff. i told her that i want him to chill now that he's older and worked hard his whole life and the extra 1k i give him helps him eat at a better restaurant, get a nicer suit, go on holidays etc. he also started seeing a woman who's in her 40's and they're pretty happy so i'm extremely happy for my dad. the money helps with dates and stuff like that and gives him a better standard of living. my wife just basically put her foot down and told me that we need to save more but we don't i pulled in 500k last year, she made around 110k and we are doing very well and have no kids and i own our condo we live in outright. she basically called me an asshole for guilting her into giving money to my dad and said he's a grown man and can figure things out himself.

"for skipping my child's birth to see my dying father?. i had to make the hardest decision of my life a week ago and i want some judgment to see if i made the right decision so please don't remove and say it needs to go tinto another subreddit cuz i'll post there too

&#x200b;

my wife went into labor a few weeks earlier then expected and she ended up giving birth at the hospital. the day it happened she told me that she was in the hospital and needed me however i had just left the house an half hour prior to go see my father who was likely about to die (he did a few hours after i arrived). i decided to see my father one last time and i felt like it was more important than seeing my child's birth because i will raise him and see him everyday for the next 18+ years and i really need to say some things to my father before he dies. my wife and the rest of her family are fucking pissed at me and said that birth is one of the most important parts of our lives and i needed to be there to support my wife and see the child. obviously i didn't want this shit to happen but i felt seeing my father for the last time was important especially since i hadn't seen him in weeks and we weren't on good terms then which we eventually resolved thankfully. if you'd like to provide any advice you're welcome to as i could use some but i'm mainly here for judgment

"for hiding my personal life at work?. i'm in a little trouble at work because i've been sort of hiding my personal life. i've worked in this office for about nine years, working my way up. i'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. with that, i never, ever talk about home life. i'm not ashamed of my life i just don't like to discuss it at work. my coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. if i'm asked any questions i usually redirect or move on to someone else. in this manner, none of my coworkers knew i'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.

we hired melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. she spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. however, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. try as she did, i never gave her anything. my coworkers view me as a sort of enigma. compartmentalization aside, i've made some great friendships at work. there are more things to talk about than my husband and my kids. they are a big part of my life but i'm not even going to martyr myself and say they're the most important. they're hugely important and come before everything else but i'm not a sycophant and i enjoy the ten hours a day i'm at work when i get to be an adult and talk about things other than jojo siwa and the newest jenndashian exploit.

last week, friday, melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. at lunch she announced to everyone that i am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. i play softball, i kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that i'm on facebook. she couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. i use a shortened version of my name (ali from alexandra) and my married name on fb so i'm not sure how she found me, unless she used whitepages and put two and two together. i've already reported her to hr.

but the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a bfd. one of my friends said she's hurt that i don't trust any of them and hold them in ""such low regard"". i tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, i just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. i never bring work home. when i'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. heck, i chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when i'm not there. i've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. i honestly don't see the problem. i've never lied to them, i've never given them false info, i've never made up wild tales about my life. i'm still the same person i was, now they just know more about me than they did.

eta: i know this has been posted three times today. i didn't know reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and i thought it was the account i was posting from so i created a second throwaway and then a third because i never got confirmation the post was uploaded. i couldn't even get past the white screen with the little reddit face spinning in the center. those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. this one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.

eta:  i don't have any sort of interesting update. hr brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us wtf is going on. i presented my side, as detailed above, melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. i asked my hr rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. there were several. then i asked him to search my married name, or the one i go by on fb, ""ali smith"". there were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. in any case, too many to count. i haven't touched my own page since i reported the incident. it was about thirty names from the top but like i said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. i do have an instagram page that's on private but i only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. she found me night before last and friended me. naturally i blocked her. hr gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. my rep wasn't sure why melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called bs on her for claiming it was innocent. so that's that. that's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. however, i took the advice from this sub and i'm making amends. they're all most receptive. i'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. but they know enough about me to know i'm not an automaton or anything.",3
"if i don't donate all or even part of my inheritance (about $725,000)? my cousin say's it's ""blood money"" and claims she's donating 100% of her share.. using a throwaway since money is involved here. lots of background and doing my best to keep it under 3000 words. 

i was born in south africa but emigrated when i was just a few months old so i am totally american. i come from a family of full on apartheid supporters and when it ended, basically everyone bailed for america. my parents and aunts and uncles eventually were educated and came around but my grandparents, while being very sweet and loving to me, were true believers in what apartheid stood for. they made a small fortune in south africa by literally investing and owning businesses in the apartheid era. to be totally fair, they also made a ton of money in the us, but still the money because they were white and well connected in south africa. 

my grandmother died recently. she lived pretty lavishly up until the day she died in a very exclusive retirement home in socal so i figured there wouldn't be any money left and maybe i'd get some family heirlooms. my head about popped off when i saw the number me and my cousin will split (it's about $725,000 each). money that will literally change my life. 

my parents business failed so i wasn't nearly as well off as my cousin. she's also now married, lives in rancho santa fe (google it if you aren't familiar) and will be just fine without this money. she claims she's going to donate 100% of it to charities in south africa. she is seriously chiding me that *if* i plan on keeping it, then i am taking advantage of blood money built on racism. 

i have student loans i could pay off, i could actually have a down payment on a house, i could invest, i mean...i know where this money came from but it could literally mean my life would be better. i understand where it came from but i also can't possibly imagine giving it away. i have no idea what charities are like in south africa and family friends we have that still live there say that corruption has taken over everything from government to charities and i'm better off just keeping it. 

i understand my cousins point but man is it hard to say goodbye to that much money that will change my life.",3
"for being frustrated that my wife is angry about the sex of our baby?. my (24m) wife (24f) is 24 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. she made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about ""sending it back"" if it was a boy. the jokes all seemed lighthearted and i just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. fast forward to our 20 week scan. we go in super excited and nervous. i don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. 

we go in and find out we are having a boy. my wife immediately bursts into tears and i hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. she doesn't stop crying the whole day. i let her calm down and try to comfort her. 

it's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. she refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. 

now that it's been nearly a month i'm starting to get a bit frustrated. it's just such an overreaction. i told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. she cried and called me an asshole. i told her she needs to get a grip. i felt awful but i feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous.

"for telling step-daughter she's the reason for divorce. yeah, i'm probably a major asshole here, but let me explain my reasoning.

i came into her life 6 years ago when she was 11. her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). her mother is not happy. she hasn't been happy for a long time. her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids i've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.

she's made it no secret she hates me. i remember when she was 13 or 14, i paid for us to go to disney land as a family vacation (cliche, i know). she refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. i was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, i went along with it and stayed home.

stuff like that is the norm. she'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. she'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. it's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. but it's ruined the marriage, because i've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. anything i do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.

anyway, my wife and i separated over this. it's just too much for me to bare. but i'm not mad at my wife, i'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.

i decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. i didn't do this to spite her, because frankly i'm ready to move on with my life. i did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. i did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)

wife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. say it's going to emotionally scar her. but quite frankly, i think she needed to be told.

"for not paying for the meal?. on a road trip last week, my girlfriend and i stopped at a rural diner for brunch. we sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). it was a very nice meal honestly. our total was around $25. i was ready to pay with my debit card.

the waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. unfortunately i had zero cash on me. ""how were we supposed to know?"" i asked. she shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. there was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.

she sighs and points to an atm on the other side of the dining room. at this point i'm still apologetic so i went there with my card. i noticed it had a fee of, i shit you not, $9. i asked to speak to the manager. she brought the owner.

i told the owner this is ridiculous. i suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that atm. nope. he threatened to call the police. i said go ahead. my girlfriend felt the same way. long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.

i told my sister about this today. she thinks the cops were wrong and i was being an asshole. because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" i think the owner is the asshole. the only part i regret was not being able to tip the waitress.

"for refusing to pay alimony to my cheating ex-wife. i met my wife in my early 30s. she was in her mid 20s at the time. i was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. she on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. 

so when i meet her we click instantly and i fall head over heels for her. we get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. when we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. obviously i was jealous but i went along with it since it seemed logical.

so she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while i work 12 hour days and then some. i'm not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.

a couple years ago i discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend's husband. divorced obviously followed.

the only major asset we had in the us was our house, which was a premarital asset. we had a shared bank account, but since i am a finance guy i handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. 

now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, i'd have no problem paying what's fair. but the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. 

so in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.

so here i am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. so i sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it's taking so long to liquidate our savings. once abroad i immediately stop alimony payments.

now she has no legal recourse (i've double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.

the reason i'm asking here is that my own children are split on this. my son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. i figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",3
"for ditching my date and causing a scene?. i'm 19f and my date was 25m, i was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while i was half way through my session. 

i get an ig message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would've found me since my page is super private, my username isn't specific at all to my real name and i have 40 followers. 
he explains he's so and so's friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it's hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so i'm excited and we plan to meet up. 

we catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, i take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. i smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. we're in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.

i study justice so he's telling me how he's an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that's when i freak. he makes a comment about how high i am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point i start to get really scared.
he keeps asking if anyone knows i'm with him, who i live with, how much money i make & how much i have on me etc. just weird questions. i was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction imo was much more extreme. i was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. my perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say i was genuinely scared.

i hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so i could be around people and also so he wasn't dui, he didn't want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that i felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.

i get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he's taking a phone call. i go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene ""i'm really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me"" they catch on and can see i'm upset. i sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he'll take me home but they are very firm. he addresses me quite angrily and asks ""who does your mum think your with?"" the owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. 

i felt guilty since i had gotten along with him and he'd taken the time to see me, i'm not 100% sure if i was in danger and if i could've stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. i tried to have tact in the situation and didn't have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would've been better to tell him i was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

edit: some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, i'm super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? correct me if i'm wrong please. i genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there's something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way i did and if i'm the ahole for handling a bad date this way. i see that this isn't as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here irl i had very mixed and negative reactions. hence why i got on here and despite all that, i do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying i did the right thing even though it didn't necessarily feel like that in the moment.",3

my aunt is not someone i see often. she got on with my son but only really saw him a handful of times a year. she came a few times to see him when he was sick but not often. when we were told he didn't have long left i asked if she wanted to come and say goodbye and she said she was too busy with work. i figured she was in denial, maybe. i certainly was. she then missed his funeral to go to a concert.

her husband messaged me yesterday asking if he would be able to get some of our sons ashes so she can have some jewellery made. apparently she asked him for one for her birthday as she really misses our son and wants to feel close to him. i said no because i want him to stay with us. all of him. then my aunt called me yesterday afternoon and said i was being selfish, he was her family too. 

i still said no. she said she acted the way she did when he died because she was struggling with it, and was in denial. but so was i. but it's been 3 years and she's hardly come to see any of us. she's not even met our newest baby yet who is 4 months old. 

so tell me, as my aunt seems to think i am, am i being the asshole?",3
"for leaving/ghosting my gf that was financially dependent on me without warning after discovering she cheated on me. **update:** 

i was not expecting to post an update so soon, but i was hit with a bombshell this afternoon.

over the weekend, both of our parents had tried to come talk to me. however i had simply ignored the knocks on the door and eventually they left. however of course they know that i can't avoid work. so they wait outside my house this afternoon to ambush me as i get home from work. with them is my girlfriend. they insist i talk to my girlfriend and i eventually relent and our parents leave.

once inside, she starts apologising and begging for forgiveness. saying that our relationship is the best thing that ever happened to her, she will never forgive herself.... basically everything that you'd expect a cheater to say.

...and then she gives the most ridiculous excuse i've ever heard. she says that a few weeks ago she found out she was pregnant, she started having conflicted feelings on if she was ready to settle down and start a family, and so she reached out to her ex for support. this emotional support quickly turned physical

this makes no sense. we have always talked about having kids excitedly.

she takes out two pregnancy tests showing positive results. she also takes out an unused one and says she can take it now if i don't believe her. so she takes it, and sure enough she's pregnant. she says it's 100% mine as she didn't cheat on me until after she got pregnant. i ask to see her phone. she reluctantly hands it over and, sure enough, she's been texting him non-stop since i threw her out.

i tell her i need time to process this and ask her to wait outside. once outside i lock the doors, unblock her on whatsapp, and send her a long text. i'm reciting this by memory so i don't have to open whatsapp and see her reply.

>whether you end up having this baby is entirely up to you. but you should know the following. first, if the child is mine, i will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. we will never get back together. the moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. secondly, i will not interact with you at all until the child is born. don't reach out to me until then, i want nothing to do with you. finally, i will not have any role in the kid's life - nor will i sign any birth certificate - until i get a paternity test. this child could have been the greatest blessing to our relationship and future, instead you turned them into an excuse to cheat. i will never forgive you for that.

i have not read her reply, and don't intend to tonight. i also won't post any updates after this. i get the impression that the kid is probably mine, so i'm basically anchoured to her for the rest of my life now.

---------------------------------

**original post**

----------------------------------------------------

**with regards to the meta post:** i know i'm not an asshole for leaving her. i'm more concerned with the way i went about it.

-------------------------

my gf and i have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. she quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.

last week i discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-bf from high-school. i needed to use her phone to call mine, and went i unlocked her phone it was open on a whatsapp conversation between them. i have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and i don't understand why she'd want to be with him.

anyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. angry that i've put so much into this relationship and woman that i thought would be the mother of my future children. angry that i've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. just angry.

so i arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day (**edit: with landlord's permission**) while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as i can find, and leave it outside. text her of what i've done, and say if she wants to get anything else i've missed to have her brother come and get it - i don't want to see or speak to her ever again.

anyway, since i did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. they say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if i kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.

what do you guys think? am i the asshole here? should i swallow my pride and approach this differently?

**edit2: the lease is also only in my name and she's never paid a dime of rent in the entire time she's been living here.**",3
"for attacking a muslim's beliefs when she didn't want to sit next to my brother and his friend on the plane?. long time lurker, here is my first post!

so i (f16) was on a flight from dubai to new york, so it was quite a long trip. usually we are upgraded to business class on this airline since our dad is a pilot, but because my brother's friend couldn't afford the seat, we decided to stay in economy. our mother was sitting in business class so she wasn't present during this whole situation.

when we got on the plane, my twin brother and his friend, 16 and 15, were in the row in front of me, my brother in the window seat and his friend in the aisle. i was sitting right behind his friend in the aisle seat.

then his woman got on, she was wearing a hijab, so it was obvious that she was a muslim. i saw her looking very uncomfortable when she saw my brother and his friend, knowing that she had the middle seat. 

i wasn't paying attention but i took off my headphones when i heard my brother's friend say no to the lady. she then said: ""it is against my religion to touch men in public"" and my brother said,

""but we're not touching you.""

she looked very angry and was almost yelling at my brother's friend to move to the middle seat so she could have the aisle. i thought she was so entitled, so i told them,

""don't move. just ignore her.""

she then proceeded to ask me if i knew them, so i said yes. she asked to switch with me. so this is what i said,

""no. i don't want the middle seat because i'm very claustrophobic (i'm not, i just prefer the aisle seat so i can stretch my legs)"" and she said, 

""that's not my problem.""

that's when i got really pissed and i said it,

""your religion is not our problem. should've chosen better seats then"" 

then she stomped her foot and went to the flight attendant, and that's the last we saw of her. i'm guessing they moved her to another empty seat. 

when we got back from the trip, my brother's friend told me he was going to move and i wasn't right to attack her religion like that.

so reddit, aita?

"- i moved for my husband's job, my kids now hate me. bit long, stick with me. throwaway because i'm active on a mom board, and haven't discussed this there.

my ex and i split 5 years ago now. we had a daughter who is 16, a son who is 13 and a daughter who is 5. he's always been a good dad, and we split 50/50 custody, essentially the kids one week my house/one week his house. after my divorce, i reconnected with a high school boyfriend and fell head over heels in love again. he's in the military but hadn't had to move in years. we married 2 years ago. 

a year ago, he got orders to move to texas from where we all were in california. my older two kids were not happy at all, and didn't want to move, while the baby didn't really express a preference. i approached my ex and told him the situation. i said i know the situation sucks, but we'd foot the bill to him for every trip to him on holidays, breaks, summers, etc. he blew his top and said absolutely not, i wouldn't ""take his kids away"" and said he'd see me in court.

the judge ended up ruling in his favor, and i was awarded summers and every other holiday. i was absolutely devastated. i moved, and i've barely seen the kids since. they came at christmas for a week, and it was tense the whole time. the older kids, especially my daughter, are short with me on facetime, while the baby gets distracted and can't chat much. my daughter has said i chose a man over her, and that she wants nothing to do with me, while my son won't talk about it but i can tell he's angry. 

i've asked my ex to talk to them about it and he basically said i chose to leave, it's my fault and he's not getting involved in ""our issues"". so, let me have it reddit, aita?",3
"thinking of leaving marriage because step-daughter got herself knocked up.... yeah, i know this sounds awful.

my (32m) wife's (35f) daughter (16f) recently announced she is pregnant. 

she claims she doesn't know who the father is. i suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. i mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? it can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake.

anyway, moving on. she is adamant on keeping the baby. abortion is out of the question apparently. wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. they're both ecstatic.

the problem i have with this is:

1. my wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. she's still in school and fully intends to go to college. my wife and i will 100% end up looking after it.

2. i am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. my wife works part time and makes very little money. i don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me.

3. i wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. she's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. i feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us.

i raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. ""this isn't up to you. this is her decision to make. we will support her.""

i agree it's her decision, but why do i have to support her?

as it stands now, i'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. i'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am i prepared to pay to raise it.

i fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it.

"for making an obese man pay me cash to take up part of my seat on a long flight?. so this month i was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which i had booked and seats selected for. i specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat — just the aisle and window. 

well, a very obese man boards and i can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. i assume maybe he bought two hence why he's even attempting to board. i'm mentally crossing my fingers he's not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. 

i get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. i sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. after a minute, i decided to be upfront and tell him:

""sir, i'm sorry but this situation is not working for me, you're taking up quite a bit of my seat"". 

he wasn't rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there's not nothing he can do — although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. it just wasn't enough, though. he still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. i'm talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. 

i end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. she instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. she goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren't any open seats on this flight, so there wasn't a way to move people so he could have two. this causes a very awkward silence. 

the guy seemed embarrassed and didn't want to get up. he mentioned how he can't wait for a later flight. i felt bad for him but i was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight — the comfort i paid for. the flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he'll need to book another flight. the guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here's where i made my offer. 

i told the guy, ""look, i'll put up with this if you give me $150 — that's half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.""

he instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. he even told me he appreciated it. 

well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn't volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. i just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. 

from my perspective, i gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and i was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person's body pressed against you involuntarily). a win-win. he wasn't angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. 

after the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but i ignored them. this leads me to beg the question, aita? ",3
"if i tell my wife that i will no longer be helping with her pregnancy cravings or sleep next to her because she lashed out at me for not finding choco chip ice cream at 3am?. this happened a couple of days ago and i was really pissed. i'm here because i want to know if i'm in the wrong here. 

my wife is going to give birth to our twin daughters. i've done everything to support her. i make breakfast everyday and i make it a point to make whatever she asks me to make. 

yesterday, my wife woke me up at 2am and told me that she wanted to eat icecream. we had no ice cream left because she ate it all at night. i really wanted to get her the ice cream. she told me that she wanted choco chip. i drove for an hour to find a place at that time. but they didn't have any choco chip at that time. i didn't want to disappoint her, so i got strawberry, her next favourite flavour. 

when i got back, i told her that i didn't find choco chip. idk what happened but she started crying and yelling  at me. she threw away the ice cream, called me a fucking imbecile and told me i didn't love her. she also told me that she didn't want to sleep next to me. i slept in another room. 

now today, she comes to me, cries, apologizes and tells me that she was really stressed out. but i did not sleep with her at night. i've decided that i don't want to do anything now. this is not the first time this has happened. i'm not a fantastic cook. she insists that i make something for her, but when i make it she always tells me that it's horrible. she later apologizes and tells me that it was wonderful ( all this started after the pregnancy ). here??",3
"for going to a nice restaurant with my wife and sharing a meal?. my wife and i are not from the us but we have lived here for the last 2 years. on a friday or saturday once a month we will try a nice restaurant that we have not been to before in our city. however since we are not used to american portion sizes so we usually order much less food than what is considered normal.

when we go to a restaurant we will usually order an appetizer and main course and share both. we will also usually have one or two glasses of wine each, or sometimes we will share a bottle if we feel like it. however occasionally when the appetizer is large we just share the appetizer instead of ordering a main course.

last night we went to a new restaurant that is considered a quite nice restaurant in the city ($20-30 per main course). when they brought out the appetizer it was very large so we shared it and we were definitely full so we didn't order a main course. we were also planning on having some wine later that night at home so we only had one glass of sparkling wine each.

when we asked for the bill, the waiter was shocked. he asked if we wanted anything else and we kindly said no but that the appetizer was delicious. after around 5 minutes we still didn't get the bill, but after close to 10 minutes either the owner or manager (don't know who he was) came up to us and gave us the bill and he said something like ""this is a ~~full~~ full service restaurant, you cannot just come in here and order an appetizer and leave"". he gave us the bill and asked us to never come back to the restaurant.

here? this seems so foreign to me. we still ordered food and drinks, why are we less welcome than any other group? it shouldn't matter that it is a full service restaurant, people have different appetites.

edit: sorry i could have worded the title better.

"for having professional hair and makeup for a wedding when the bride didn't. hi, y'all.

my brother (m40) and his wife (f35) got married on sunday. i (f22) am pretty close with my brother, but not his wife, so while i was a guest, i wasn't in the bridal party. 

they got married at a somewhat local mansion, which is actually pretty affordable for a wedding venue. the dress code on the invitation was ""formal."" for the three weddings i've been to with formal dress codes (and the eight i've been to semi-formal dress codes), the implication was always that it meant professional hair and makeup. that is how *my* whole family took the dress code, so we all coordinated appointments. a few of us actually went together and had a makeup artist from a few towns over come in, so my sil could hire locally. 

well, when we got there,  her family looked good, but their hair and makeup were clearly not professionally done. when her bridesmaids came out, it was apparent they hadn't used a professional either, nor had she. 

it was kind of awkward in pictures, but i didn't really see a big deal.

well, yesterday, i got a barrage of messages from the bridal party, her mother, and the bride herself about my family trying to ""upstage her"" and that sort of thing. quite a few other relatives got the messages too, including my grandmomma. (fyi, my brother thought i looked pretty and didn't see an issue except ""when did you become a woman?"")

i've tried explaining that it was a miscommunication, but they're having none of it. was i really a bitch?

 however the last few days he got increasingly agitated and kept asking me if i was lying, if he's too small, and wouldn't take ""you're fine"" or ""you're average"" or ""i don't care how big it is"" for an answer. i told him to stop pestering me but this went on for a few more days until i snapped and told him he's below average but he has nothing to worry about. obviously he didn't take it well.

"for telling my wife that when/if she quits her job to be a sahm i am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore?. my wife and i have a 6 month old baby girl and a two year old boy. wife hasn't been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and i actually just got a new job. 

at my old job i was working 45-50 hours a week. at my new job my hours fluctuate a lot — it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. i make a lot more though so there's that. the pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. my wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a sahm which is what she's wanted. 

the issue is that my wife and i aren't on the same page about what this change would mean. before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. we also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). 

i told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. these cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and i also think it's practical.  she was mostly agreeable to that. but then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. 

i told her there was no way i was going to be taking on as many work hours as i am and then come home to cook or clean too. that would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. 

she looked at me like i was some sort of neanderthal but i think what i'm saying is completely fair. i'm not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. i recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce i would support her 100%. but i think it's fair that if i'm the sole paycheck and working crazy hours i don't come home to more stress and chaos. 

obviously my wife and i will have to work this out between ourselves. i'm mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base. 

**edit: well this blew up since i last checked it. i can see people are really passionate about this topic and you all have encouraged me to think more deeply about it. i will read as many of the (4.2k??) comments as i can. i think i'll let my wife take a look at the thread too since many have gone out of their way to offer constructive comments for both of us.**",3
"for telling people my sister's youthfulness comes from plastic surgery and fillers?. my sister is 34 and i'm 40, but since our early 20s people have always assumed she's the older sister. 

i don't know why she seems to have aged early or why i look younger - i was an alcoholic and a drug user in my 20s and probably deserve to look older. i used to joke that it was payback for her being prettier (she was and still is a total babe).

i moved away years ago and we only see each other occassionally. last weekend i went back to our hometown for the wedding of a family friend we hadn't seen in ages, and i was shocked by her appearance.

i knew she used botox, but this was next level. her face was puffy, her lips were super-plump, her eyes looked different and there was not a wrinkle to be seen. i asked about it straight away and she admitted she'd had her eyelids lifted and ""quite a bit of filler"". i'm cool with that - do what makes you happy.

she asked me not to tell anyone and i said of course i wouldn't. but then...

now, i thought she looked weird because i know what she normally looks like without filters and facetune, but people from our childhood who hadn't seen us in years didn't and were saying how young she looked and asking what her secret was.

i was absolutely fine with that until she said:

""it's probably because i didn't drink and smoke my way through my 20s like ambiguousturtlejuice.""

as a recovering alcoholic who prefers people to not know, i was hurt by that. without thinking i blurted out (louder than i'd intended): ""oh fuck off - it's all the plastic surgery and botox and fillers"".

i regretted it before i'd even finished saying it, but i thought she'd laugh it off and it would be fine... but she got teary and flustered and ran out of the room.

my mom thinks she was an asshole for bringing up my drinking. my brother thinks she over-reacted and should get over it. pretty much everyone else thinks i am a massive asshole.

i was out with my niece at a kid's playplace/mall for kids, and she was more terror than lovely. she was defiant, and i'm all about consequences after two warnings. she kept running from me laughing her butt off, so i told her it was time to go. normally she'll go quietly but this time, filled with vim, vigor and grape juice, she pitched a gigantic fit so i had to carry her. she wasn't screaming in a ""who is this help me"" way but in a clearly understandable ""no, i want to stay and play. auntie(me), no"" way. but also she's 3, so maybe if you're not used to her it's not clear.

i was pissed. i told her i don't have to prove anything to her and i'm leaving with my kid. she then literally ran  to security, screaming that a kid's being kidnapped. cops called. security guy asks what's up. i was polite to him but i told the lady off. i said it's way too damn *present day* to be act like  mixed race children, or blended family don't exist, and to immediately jump to kidnapping was insane. the cops showed, and they asked my niece who i am ""auntie (me)!"" and i showed them some pictures of us together in clearly different settings, they apologized, reprimanded her. it's done. 

she  works somewhere in the complex, but not where we were. i want to report it. she'd been watching us and saw my niece and i hanging for at least 30 minutes familiarly. so while i could have showed her the pictures, i didn't feel like i needed to. it's not her job and in fact the person whose job it was apologized to me as we left. now, i have had this happen before, and someone is a little sketched. i'm polite, it becomes obvious that she knows me, and they drop it. i just had flashforwards to a time when my niece might pull the ""this isn't my mom"" card. and then i really would need the cops to be called because i'd kill her. 

i get she was concerned. and that unlikely i'd adopted a white baby. but also, 100% fuck off, lady. aita? would i be if i complained to the facility?",3
"for telling a friend's girlfriend that she's spoiled?. several days ago we invited a friend and his girlfriend over for dinner. before we start, some background about my friend: i've known him for almost 15 years, he never had a lot of money, but he never let that get in the way. he worked hard, saved hard, and bought things if he decided he really wanted them, but was not a spendthrift. he paid his way through university without taking any loans, working his ass off in two jobs while full time studying. he recently opened a startup of his own which has great potential and has started getting nibbles and several customers, but is far from being a success, or even profitable, yet.

on to the story - they were talking about how they were looking to buy a car (his first), because now that they lived together, she felt that they could split the cost of a car because they were saving money on rent. i could tell my friend wasn't too hot on the expense, because all his money was in the startup and he'd need to take out a loan to get a car, in addition to the loans he had already taken out to get his business up and running. when we were talking about it, his girlfriend kept saying things about how ""at 33 years old i shouldn't have to take the bus anymore"", and ""taking public transportation is for losers"". as someone who bought my first car (used) at 31 because my family was growing, i'll admit i took some offense to that. i've used public transportation for years (and still do) and never considered it ""beneath me"".

the real kicker came when she started talking about getting a brand-new car, straight from the dealership. wouldn't even consider getting something a coupla years old. here's where i may have overstepped my bounds, and told her that her entire attitude is spoiled, and that if she really cared about my friend, she'd realize that he doesn't have the ability to spend that much money, and she should look at something cheaper if she wouldn't deign to ride the bus with the rest of the common folk. 

after a minute or so of awkwardness, the conversation switched to other topics and the subject of the car was dropped. after they left, my wife said i shouldn't have called her spoiled to her face and i almost ruined dinner for everyone. my friend told me, though, that she dropped the idea of the brand new car and they're looking at the user car lots.

so, aita?",3
"for allowing the girls on my hs track team (i'm the new head coach) wear bikini tops and cut off shorts for a fund raising car wash?;. this is very fresh, posting from my phone and a throwaway because i'm honestly nervous about how big this is going to get. i just got an email from the assistant superintendent of the entire district that i have to be in his office monday morning and i'm scared shitless. 

basically i just graduated college and got my teaching certificate last year. the school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so i volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this. we have some very talented girls and i enjoy it. 

we were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. on monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. they argued it was for thier comfort since it's about 80 here today. i was a little nervous but agreed. apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. i'm so naive i thought initially people were just being charitable but when i saw boys from surrounding schools i knew somthing was up. and it wasn't long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. the girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made. 

parents are furious with me and obviously it's gone up the chain. i'm hoping to god i can chalk this up to my inexperience and i'm not fired buf when i had a 6'4"" dad screaming in my face that he's going to get my fired...i'm scared. 

am i the asshole for allowing this?

edit: just as a quick update, in rhe last few minutes i've gotten two texts from parents offering me thier support and willing to show up with me monday to at the very least talk about how out of line the dad was who screamed in my face, that makes me feel a little better.",3
"for using the 'hidden' women's bathroom stalls when there's a long line?. okay this is so stupid and i really feel like i'm nta but my friend is adamant that i am so i'm seeking reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. 

my girl friends and i were recently at canada's wonderland and having been there dozens of times since i was a kid (am now in my 20s), i know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has ""additional stalls"" at the back of the bathroom. 

so basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says ""additional stalls ->"" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. 

well, for the last few times i've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and i always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. there never is and i use the bathroom stalls there. on my way out i'll always tell other women""hey there's stalls back there"" to which they say thank you.

my friend now thinks i'm selfish and rude for doing this. she thinks that i should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. 

i don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. 

my friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she ""sees a different side"" of me. this is something i truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, i'm starting to question if she's right?

please tell me if i'm wrong, seriously, i don't get it. 

tl;dr: apparently i'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.

edit: this is epic.. i really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. thank you to everyone that replied. i'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.

and to all women, i'm sorry our bathrooms suck. i'll be even more helpful letting others know about those stalls in the future.. having to pee really bad and waiting is the worst. tiny bladder club!!",3
"for showing up at my cousin's wedding in a hoodie and jean shorts?. last fall, my husband and i went to my cousin's wedding in another state. 

in the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. she was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. the wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. i thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. she didn't tell the couple tho. just complained about it to us behind their backs. 

we traveled 600 miles to the wedding. we treated the trip like a vacation. spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. 

the day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. i hate dressing up so i was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. 

my husband and i had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. a few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. i wore a hoodie, daisy duke shorts and cute sandals. 

i noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but i figured they didn't get the memo. the bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which i thought was weird for a casual wedding. the reception was awesome. nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. we had a blast. 

so we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. they thought it was very disrespectful. apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. this explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. 

tbh we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. and they never specified the dress code in the invitation. but i still have to ask. aita?",3
"for not being attracted to my girlfriend's body?. i made an alt account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
i'm also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so i'll try to keep it as pg as i can.

so, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. we have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
i will say that she's the first thin person i've ever been with. she's flat, petite and pretty short. most of the girls i've been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and i've always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
this all started when me and my girlfriend were watching netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if i was okay with her having a flat chest. (she's always been insecure about not having b**bs.) i asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that i never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. that kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she's not attractive if she doesn't have a certain figure.) she said she was just curious.
i told her i had to be honest, and said that i'm not attracted to her chest size, and that i actually prefer bigger b-bs. it's not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. if i'm being honest, that's why i usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
she was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. she texted me later on that night and told me what i said hurt her a little. she said we've been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like i lied to her. i told her i didn't know what to tell her, and that i was just being honest (i was.).

am i being the asshole here?

"for telling the barista that my girlfriend is with me?. basically i'm 25m and she's 23f.

she gets company credit for food and drinks as she works for like a week at a time. she cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. she always goes to the same coffee shop. 

me and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. she always says the guy who serves her coffee is ""beautiful"", she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. that was fine. 

anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. i trust her entirely, i know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything. 

anyway, i went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. i ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and i shit you not he said ""oh is that for emma?"" and when i looked shocked he went ""i just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it"". i said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. the guy kinda laughed and i said that i appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, i think he was flirting. he laughed again and said sure thing. 


i didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare i embarrass her like that. this pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! she said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend. 
fair, innocent mistake on my behalf but the gf never told me this beautiful man was gay. 

she stormed out and still won't speak to me without making sly digs.

"for being mad at my wife for dumpster diving?. hi everyone, i'd like some input. 

my wife and i struggle to make ends meet. we strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. this includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. 

recently our dd dropped the milk and spilled it. it was 5 days to payday and we'd already done our grocery shopping. my wife said she'd figure it out. i know she has a little money stashed for herself that she's gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, i figured she must have decided to dip into that. boy was i wrong. 

the next week i noticed our food was a little...higher quality. a couple of brand name things, even a roast on sunday with asparagus. i figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when i asked she said ""oh no, i found a bunch of money off coupons."" then she showed a few to me. 

they were those ""earn 0.07$ a gallon"" receipts you get at the gas station. she had gone there and dug through the garbage! she said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. 

i was speechless. i asked her how she could lower herself like that. she replied that she did it for our kids. when i asked why she didn't use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. 

i'm so disgusted guys. i can't believe she did this. i don't even want to look at her. she on the other hand is mad at me, and says i'm an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. for expecting my wife not to dumpster dive?

edit: ok! i am definitely the asshole. after reading all of your comments, i really thought about it. i talked to my wife, and told her i was sorry for the way i acted. she is annoyed but willing to forgive me. i was actually mad at myself. the reason we are struggling is because i was in an accident a few months ago. i slid through a stop light on an icy road. it has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade i've worked in for 15 years. i'm on disability through my employer but it isn't even half of what i used to make. we are getting by, but it is tight. and i don't know what we are going to do when it runs out. my wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). i guess i was just mad at myself because i can't take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. i'm going to give her a foot rub tonight. thanks for the honesty guys.

"for letting my kids reject hugs and kisses from family?. my two year old son is at an age where everyone wants to touch him and pinch him. 

my wife and i agreed we wouldn't force our kids to hug or kiss anyone because we want to teach appropriate physical boundaries and ownership of your body from an early age. 

recently my grandmother visited and when she was leaving my sister directed my son to ""give grammy a kiss goodbye"" and he said ""don't want to"" and we said ""that's fine, wave goodbye then."" and he waved and said goodbye. 

she started to say ""oh, no kiss for grammy?"" but i shut that down with ""(son) has a lot of ways to express his feelings"" and we left it at that. she seemed to understand. 

my sister took her to the airport but when she was over later she said i was an asshole for not having my son kiss his great grandmother goodbye knowing it meant something to her just because he ""didn't want to"". 

i tried to explain not wanting physical touching isn't the same as not wanting to leave the park or whatever, but she said it's not as big a deal to him to give her a quick kiss as it was for her to feel her great grandson didn't treasure her visit. 

we're about to host thanksgiving and there will be plenty of family expecting hugs and kisses and physical affection from our son, and in a couple years, from our daughter as well.

"for using poop bags for my daughter's birthday party?. my daughter just turned 6. we had a birthday party for her on saturday. that morning was pretty hectic. i was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and i didn't notice.

all that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as ""sarah"" and it's ""sara"" and i said, ""who cares, just scrape off the h"" but she insisted on returning it. so i said ""fine whatever."" and then as she's leaving she says since i screwed up already i should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

and i go into the kitchen and i ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" she says ""the gift bags."" i found all the candy and toys and what i thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. so i make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

my wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt i made at helping. so a little while after that, the guests arrive. the day went pretty well until the end. my daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. my wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until i got the box. she looked inside an was horrified

""what the fuck is this?"" she whispers. and she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. i follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. she's so embarrassed. why? she wont say. i'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. i then i just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically i'm stupid and i've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? i tell her ""it's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. she says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

so yeah i've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. i told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said i was a huge asshole and she's mad that i dont think it's a big deal. and i still dont. actually, i think i'm the one that should be mad at her for keeping this going for almost a week.

so, reddit, aita?

"for making gargoyle noises while my overtly loud roommates have sex late into the night after repeatedly asking them to quiet down?. so, i've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. but basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.

i've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.

well, it didn't stop. 

anyway, since i'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, i've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until i kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.

the noises are kind of, like, skreeeeeeeoooooooash! skreeeeascchhhhh! followed by snorts and the like.

so far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what i'm doing downstairs. i brush it off like it's no big deal and i really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. his audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor gargoyle rears its ugly head.

"for demanding access to my fiance's bank accounts?. edit 1: wow, thank you all so much for you input. i will post an update in a day or so

edit 2: please stop giving me awards this is a throwaway account. spend your money on people who make dank memes

the title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

my fiance and i are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, summer 2021.

i make pretty good money for my age. in fact, i make more money than any of my friends or family, and i would bet i'm in the ""1%"" of my community. i try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. i should also add when we started dating, i was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

my fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. she was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  since then, she hasn't worked. i really didn't mind at all. i make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

i am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead i just would venmo her some cash weekly. it was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

she has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. i know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  she has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

i shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

i told her i would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so i could see exactly what she was spending it on. i could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but i hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

she blew up. telling me i wasn't trusting her and how i was the one against joint bank accounts so i should understand her privacy. yeah, huge red flags all over the place.

i talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying i was not respecting her privacy when i'm the one that demands it also.

"for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?. tl;dr at bottom

okay so i'm almost 19.

when my paternal uncle was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. they got married later on, converted to christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. 

i know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. he didn't say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. i thought it's weird they never told their daughters, given that they're all such protestors against abortion.

but anyways dad also has a sister, who's daughter i'm really close with. she's christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last may. then her boyfriend left her over it. i absolutely adore her baby, and i try to help raise him given that he doesn't have a father.

i'm usually on good terms with my aforementioned uncle's daughters, and i was messaging them three way last night. i was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and eventually they asked why i would celebrate him so much given that he was created in sin.

i told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone makes mistakes. but they overrode me, saying that she's easy and shouldn't have spread her legs blah blah blah. it went on for a few more messages.

i got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said 

""yeah i hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion all outside of marriage way back when. everyone makes mistakes and our cousin is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.""

three hours later and there was still no response; i knew i was in deep shit.

and i was! my parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night, meaning i'm using my old old old phone right now. they were very tense with me today. i was very earnest. 

i always like posting online where no one can physically judge me, so thus i ask, for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?

"for starting a business in direct competition with my father's and making him lose clients?. so i have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when i was 13. i never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. it's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

i worked with him on and off through college and i've gotten very good at it.

he asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after i graduated. but my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

i do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. he also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

to no one's surprise, my father said i needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

i refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. my father was upset but i guess he figured he couldn't stop me. we continued having weekly dinners.

for some reason, people are liking my company's work more. i have expanded my company more than my father ever has. i also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. i don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless i want to.

last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. i admit i did feel bad so i offered him a full time job in my company and that i'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. but i told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

this made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. he said i betrayed him. then i basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

i do feel kind of guilty i ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. but at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

"for telling my kid i would help him get a switch if he can beat ocarina of time?. my 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a nintendo switch so he can play botw. right now he has $200 saved up. at his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.

i know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn't been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. now i have to say, he's a really good kid. kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. he's been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.

instead of making him do more chores to earn more money, i thought of a more fun solution to help him get his switch. i told him, if you can beat ocarina of time (without googling for help - though i would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old n64, i'll pay for the rest of your switch and get you botw. wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. part of my reasoning too is i just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and oot is a timeless classic. 

he jumped at the idea! after a weekend of playing, he's already at zoras domain as young link. he seems to be having fun with it and hasn't gotten too frustrated yet. he's only played minecraft really so the dated graphics don't bother him either. 

but anyway i told a couple friends about it, and they think i'm a massive dick. that i'm trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that i should just get him the switch because he's already such a good kid. now i'm having second thoughts and am feeling bad about it, but he does seem to be enjoying the challenge.

like 90% of people in the gym i just want to be left alone, ignore everyone, and pretend the world doesn't exist.  so i move on with life and do another set, but then she does her set and sure enough when she is at the bottom of her squat her yoga pants are stretched on her ass they go completely see through and i can pretty much see her butthole.  i don't mean if i squint and stare, i mean plain as day, anyone on my side of the racks can see through her pants. 

no idea why i cared (am married and completely uninterested) but i go into helpful mode and pull my headphones out and turn around quietly enough that only the two of us can hear say this:

""hey this is super creepy, but i'd feel creepier if i didn't say something.  when you squat, your pants stretch and go completely see through on your ass.""

again i thought i was being helpful and that she'd want to know, but wholly shit did she not see it that way. this girl practically screams ""you fucking pervert! stop staring at my ass!"" 

not needing to be told twice now that half the gym is staring at me, i go back to my workout and suffer the angry looks for another 20min and go home.  

i tell my wife about it who laughs and says i was totally an asshole for saying that and she'd be pissed and super embarrassed if someone did that to her. so reddit, settle this, aita?",3
"for ""double-reporting"" an employee (to his boss, and then to corporate) and probably getting him fired?. my husband and i have a 15 year old son, who is biracial; my husband is african american and i am white (this will be important later on in the story). my son just got his driver's permit and has begun driving with me on a regular basis. the other day we were on the road, and he accidentally cut off a truck, making him have to break abruptly.

i scolded my son and gave a ""sorry"" wave to the driver. at the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. his car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. he rolled down the window and shouted the n-word at my son. my son's face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. the encounter **sickened** me.

i did some research on the company; at one point i even plugged them into facebook. they have a very active facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. i called the company and reported the man's behavior, describing him very vividly. they informed me that they knew exactly who i was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. i had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.

two months later, when i was browsing facebook kind of boredly one day, the company's name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it i clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. one of the very first photos/posts i saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. to my horror, i saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. meaning they didn't fire him.

the company is part of a nationwide chain, so i called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person i could get to, and i reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn't fire him. the man i spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person i'd reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have ""no place"" and ""no future"" in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee's career is now toast.

was it right of me to ""double-report"" this guy? i'm sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that i was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. am i an asshole or a ""karen"" for not dropping this matter?",3
"for not wanting to be involved with a child i helped conceive?. i got pregnant in high school, when i was 17 (i am just turning 30 now). i wanted an abortion and my boyfriend begged, begged, begged, guilted, begged me to carry the fetus to term and that he would raise the baby himself. he involved his parents, who involved my parents, and since my parents were against abortion, they agreed on my behalf that this is what would happen.

i was naive at the time about how horrible pregnancy and delivery would be with a baby you don't want. i was miserable, in pain, anxious, isolated, and sick the whole time. delivery was a nightmare. the whole process was so traumatic that i've been diagnosed with ptsd from it, for which i've been in therapy for the last four years.

in my country, if both parents are 18 and both agree to it, one parent can legally give up parental obligations, so i did that. i haven't regretted it for a minute (i do regret not getting an abortion because of the trauma it caused me, i do not regret giving up parental rights). i do not think about this child, i do not think of myself as having a child, i am not a mother. i have never met the child and never want to.

last month, my exboyfriend contacted me (again through my parents) because he and his wife have split up and now that his daughter is 12, she wants to know about the circumstances of her birth. i told him that we did things according to his wishes and i never, ever want contact with his child and don't want him to tell her my name or contact information.

he and my parents are furious and my parents also admitted they thought i'd 'come around.' they want to be in his child's life but want me to also be a part of it. i won't. am i the asshole here? all i have done is what i have always said i would do.

note: sorry, english isn't my first language. i also tried to talk this out on another forum and it turned into a very us-centric conversation about abortion and child support but none of that applies as i am not from us and we do not have the same type of child support laws.",3
"for telling my friend's husband about her secret food stash?. background: i have this friend mandy who i guess what you'd call ""militantly obese."" she has claimed in the past that it's a civil rights issue and that she is ""genetically fat"" just like people are ""genetically black"" (her words, not mind but you can see her mindset). 

recently mandy's husband said enough is enough is enough and told her that if she didn't at least make and effort to change he was leaving. mandy was diagnosed with being pre-diabetic and called me sobbing both because of what her husband said and the doctor being ""anofher link in the chain."" 

this was about january and mandy and her husband have been on a calorie restricted diet and he has lost...probably 20lbs and mandy has actually gained weight. mandy was using this as ""proof"" that her issue was genetic. 

i was helping mandy unload groceries the other day and came across a huge tupperware bin the back of her suv. i assumed she wanted it unloaded but as i moved it, the lid came loose and it was packed to the gills with treats, most opened and half eaten. i asked her about it. she got super defensive and told me to mind my own business. i asked her if this why she's gaining weight. she told me to fuck off. i texted her husband because in the heat of the moment i was furious she had spoken to me like that.

her husband has filed for emergency seperatrion so mandy can't ruin him financially (she has threatened this in the past) with the aim of divorce. mandy is blaming me, am i the asshole here?


edit: i accept my judgment and i won't delete but the comments have taken a ridiculous turn and i don't want to he part of this anymore. no i don't want to have sex with him. nor did i ever imply or infer that. enjoy your day.


edit 2: based on some responses that said i was the asshole for acting out of anger rather than concern (which i accept) i called and told mandy that i was sorry for my reasons for texting her husband. she said that i am just another person oppressing her and that even the avengers were oppressing her these days. i asked her what she meant (won't spoil the movie) but i explained to her that i was acting out of frustration and avengers is just a movie and now i was really concerned. she said i could take my concern and shove it up my ass and we're done and hung up and has apparently blocked my number. thank you for participating but i think it's a dead subject at this point. i hope she gets the help she needs",3
"for not teaching a skill to my oldest son that i taught his siblings because of the custody arrangement?. edit/update:

the moderators have been kind enough to let me update my post.

i know many, many people have asked about the skillset i mentioned. i just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable with a quick search. i will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. it's just a niche product and not many people do it. the tools and techniques are unorthodox.

i spent a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.

i have talked to my younger kids and i explained to them that even if they aren't happy with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.

they agreed to extend the offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a salaried employee. but they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. i actually think this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.

however, i'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. he is feeling some sort of way about working for his brothers, not with them.

i reached out to a teacher in alaska who i know casually. he might do me a favor and take on an apprentice. 

i need to scrounge up some money and see if i can send my son there. but again, it's alaska and i'm not sure if my son will be receptive.

i don't know what else i can offer at this point. my wife is disgusted that we've become that family that is fighting about money. she wants to force the twins to give a stake in the company to their brother but i really think it's a bad idea. they need to fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. i don't believe we should be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.

i'll be meeting my son this friday for dinner. i hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.

i also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. they've always enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. it's not helping.

thanks everyone.


this is the original story:

this has quite literally fractured my family.

i have an older son from my first marriage who's now 24. i have two younger kids from my current marriage who are 21 year old twins.

my divorce occurred right after my son was born. 

over the years, my visitation has been primarily summers and holidays since my ex-wife moved to a different state.

i have a particular skillset i'm was very good at. and all three of my kids have expressed interest in it. unfortunately, i have only been able to meaningfuly teach it to my younger kids.

this was because to make my visitation with my older son more memorable, i would do camping/vacations etc. i didn't have time to teach him properly.

also, anything i did try to teach him was forgotten and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.

the major issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using this skill. i provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. this company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.

my older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly making a lot of money. especially compared to his siblings.

part of this is my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe have me teach him what i knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and i told him i couldn't.

and now, i'm not well enough to teach anymore.

he is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. that he'll do the finances.

this was not received well by his siblings who say they do basically 95% of the work. and that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to get it running.

i'm really at a loss here. i thought of just giving my share of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started this company in the first place.

my oldest has become very bitter about this and has involved my parents. they are taking his side and now my younger kids are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.

our sunday family lunches are no longer happening and i'm having to see my oldest for dinner on other days. and everytime i see him i'm getting accused of not treating him fairly. it kills me because i made so many compromises to have him in my life in a meaningful way.

he accused me on saturday of pushing him out my new family and loving his siblings more. i haven't been able to sleep since.

should i have done all this differently?",3
"for telling my son that i don't trust his boyfriend. my son(26m) introduced us to his boyfriend(23m) few years ago. they live together and they're pretty serious, but me and my husband don't know anything about him. we see each other often. i just know his age and name. 

he's financially stable, he owns a huge house, when we asked him where he worked, he just chuckled awkwardly and didn't answer us. he never answers any questions. 

recently my son talked to me and said that he wanted to propose to him. i was happy for him of course. i congratulated him. then we started talking about some stuff. he asked me opinion about him. i told him that i basically don't know him so i don't trust him that much, but since he loves him it's his choice. he got upset at that and left pretty soon. he has been acting distant since that.",3
"for naming my dog askim?. 8 years ago i got a gorgeous chug. while extremely high i decided that the greatest dog name ever thought of is askim, because when people ask me his name and i tell them about 50% of the time they'll awkwardly bend down and ask my dog it's name. it's hilarious. 
i had my fun for the first few weeks but eventually everyone had just gotten used to the name and the joke faded away. occasionally i'll be chatting to someone that hasn't met askim yet and when they ask his name i have my little laugh but other than that it's a dead joke. 
well, i just moved into a new neighborhood with a great park that has lots of dogs and very chatty regulars. an elderly lady asked askim's name, said ""what?"" so i repeated myself and she turned to my dog and asked him his name. i quickly explained but instead of getting the usual chuckle she became extremely upset and felt very humiliated. since then a couple of people at the park have approached me and told me they ""heard about my joke"" and that they didn't appreciate pranks in a nice family park.

i honestly don't get it, but since the people that have reacted well to my dog's dumb name have been friends, coworkers and family and these strangers are having a very different reaction i'll accept your judgement on it.

edit: it's a always a little jarring to wake up to 650+ notifications, i'll go through them at my own pace throughout the day.

i should have been clearer, but i guess i didn't know how to spell it out until i saw you guys suggest it. i absolutely think that the reason for her reaction is that i made her feel foolish, and she undoubtedly thought i did that intentionally. this is a pretty close knit community and she sought support from her friends who just took her distress at face value and confronted me about it.

the truth is that i say the word ""askim"" multiple times a day. i'm aware that the name originated in a joke but at this point it's just a thing i call my dog. when going out i'm not looking for new victims or inviting people to get tricked, and i wasn't trying to trick her, it was small talk and i didn't even  think about it until i got a negative reaction. 

it's been pointed out that elderly people can feel really insecure about their diminishing faculties and i know from personal experience that it's very true. i really like the idea of posting an explanation on the community facebook page, especially now that i know it's turkish meaning and that it's a town in norway and neighborhood in sweden.",3
"not caring about or accommodating for my roommate's girlfriend's baby. i (27f) and my roommate (23m) rent from our landlord (60m) and are both on the lease. recently my roommate started dating a woman (19f) with a kid (toddler). 

both the woman and the kid are really annoying. i'm childfree and dislike being around children. this annoying toddler always screams and throws tantrums. i could deal with this until now. roommate's girlfriend decided it was ok for her to move in without paying rent since she got kicked out of her parents house (wonder why?). i am very vocally not happy with this and i told the landlord immediately and he said he'd do something about it but never did. it's been a month so i'm not even sure if she can be legally evicted now, not that it's even in my hands now.

best thing i can do now is just ignore the girlfriend and her kid. i don't acknowledge the kid, i bought a minifridge for my room so that she doesn't steal my food, i moved my tv and all my consoles from the living room into my room since i hate going out there now anyway. apart from that business is completely normal. i smoke weed (legal, not against the lease so long as i do it on the balcony), have people over including my girlfriend who i have sex with, practice my instruments as loud as i want during non-quiet hours. i refuse to babysit for any amount of time for any reason. one time i was sleeping and got woken up to my door being knocked on and my phone vibrating. i saw a bunch of texts from roommate saying that they need me to babysit. i lied and said i was out which lead to them having to cancel their plans for the day.

roommate's girlfriend hates me and thinks i'm being selfish. thinks that the baby needs to come first. she has no money and my roommate makes a lot less than me so she thinks i should be responsible for childproofing the house. i told her to take it up with the landlord and that i wasn't wasting my money on her and her kid that isn't even wanted here.

today i was having my lunch with my mom and vented about this to her and she said that i'm being really mean because even though the circumstances aren't ideal ""babys should come first, always"". am i really the asshole for wanting to live my life exactly the same as before some unwanted kid started squatting in my house? the way i see it she should go find some other place or if she can't afford one a shelter somewhere.",3
"if i tell my stepdaughter and my wife that i don't want to use the investments i made for my late daughter to finance her college education?. my daughter passed away 6 years ago fighting a rare genetic condition. the condition was also responsible for my late wife's death when my daughter was only an infant. i don't want to discuss anything related to that now. let me talk about the issue at hand. 

i'm now married to my amazing wife. i have a stepdaughter who will be starting high school shortly. i made a lot of investments for my late daughter. i thought i could give her a head start in life. but that never happened. so i decided to donate the money to a charity ( which helps kids with  genetic disorders ). the investments i made mature in an year and i plan on donating all of it. 

now my wife wants me to use the money for my stepdaughter. she tells me that this will help her have a head start in life and that would partially fulfill the purpose of the investments. she thinks this will also help us finance her college education. she doesn't want her getting bogged down by loans, which is a sound argument. i love my stepdaughter, but i don't think i'm ready to do this. i want to donate the money. here?",3
"for expecting a guy who invites me to his house for a movie date at dinner time to offer drinks or food?. the setup: i've known this guy for a couple years and we've worked together occasionally. we've had a couple dates before. we split the bill without any discussion or issue. 

he snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. i say sure.

i forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point i replied ""pizza and a movie"" and he replied ""yeah see you soon!"" it was just an innocent phrase but i didn't eat that day and assumed we'd get food together.

i show up and he has the movie. i say ""so are we getting food?"" 

he says ""i already ate. but i'm sure you have apps on your phone if you want something."" then he leaves to go to the bathroom.

i sit there awkwardly. this guy previously talked about being a men's rights guy. a normal one, not an incel dickhead. he also mentioned he's low on cash. but isn't it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? if he was too broke i'd obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn't the vibe i got since he bragged about a new game he bought. 

he returns and turns on the tv and turns off all the lights. then he goes into the kitchen, which i assume is to get alcohol. 

i call out casually ""what do you got to drink?"" 

he calls back ""do you like tap water?""

this is not some red pill bullshit. i know this guy, he's serious. there's nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. 

i call out, ""yeah, sure.""

he brings me back a glass of tap water. he winks at me.

i'm starving. i haven't eaten since 8am. 

i say ""hey, i don't wanna be weird, but i thought we were getting pizza."" 

he says in a sympathetic tone, ""oh. i see. you must have been confused. you mentioned the food, not me. i should have cleared that up, i ate earlier. sorry if that wasn't clear. we can still get a pizza if you want. just pick anywhere nearby and order it.""

this is still kind of shitty to me, but i ignore it and order one large pizza. the pizza shows up. i eat two slices of it. the rest of it sits there the entire movie. he doesn't offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. he tries to make out with me during the movie. i stop him and feel too weird to be into it. 

after the movie, i decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. i tell him my feelings and how he's weird with money and i'm uncomfortable. he feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. there was no bad intention at all. no red pill, no plan, nothing. just a dude who didn't think my pizza was his responsibility. 

then he asks me to have sex with him.

i decline. knowing we still have to work together, i manage to tiptoe out the door.

i don't expect or need people to buy me things, but i think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners. (and then they can offer to split the tab)

"for asking my wife for an abortion.. me (31m) & my wife (29f) are very vehemently childfree. we're not one of those nutters who calls kids crotch fruit or spawn or whatever godforsaken name there is, but it was an agreement that we had very early in the relationship that we wouldn't have kids.

now i've been putting off getting a vasectomy, i did get one a few weeks ago but i was just procrastinating it which was my fault i guess. however i used condoms and my wife has been on birth control since she was 14, so we were all good. so about 2 weeks before the vasectomy, me and the wife were getting down to business and i realized that i'd ran out of condoms, she reminded me that she's on birth control so we proceeded with the deed. i go get some
more condoms after, vasectomy happens, and  everything's all good.

nope. she's now six weeks pregnant, i was surprised cause isn't she supposed to be on birth control? come to find out that she hasn't been taking it for at least a few months now. on top of that, she wants to keep the kid which i am very against, she's very fucking ecstatic which shocked me cause obviously she's against having kids too. i feel so damn betrayed in this situation, she knows i'm very against kids and not only that but i was a foster child and don't know anything about my parents so i have no clue what inheritable diseases i may have. 

i really don't want to have a kid. so much so that i'm thinking of divorcing her if she's not willing to get rid of it, and to be honest i might divorce her anyways cause of the crap she pulled with the birth control. 

i have told her that i'm against this pregnancy but i haven't pushed any further than that. would i be the asshole for possibly divorcing her over this, or asking her to get an abortion?",3
"for suggesting that my trans friend wear a towel at a japanese sauna?. i am a 20 y/o girl. i am in japan on exchange with some friends of mine. most of my friend group are women, including a 21 y/o trans woman. she was born a male and started transitioning in her teens. currently she is pre-op and saving up for gender reassignment surgery. however, you can hardly tell that she used to be a male, save for her voice and height/body frame.

anyways, yesterday night, a bunch of girls (5 or so) from my classes decided to go to a nearby onsen, or japanese bath house. basically, you are expected to get completely naked. everything is gender segregated. there is a separate men's section and women's section.

my friend who is trans also wanted to go. so we all went as a group. everyone in our group knows that she is trans and pre-op, but i think everyone was uncomfortable talking about the issue of being naked in the bath house. finally, when we were in the changing rooms, i quietly suggested to her that she should probably wrap a towel around her hips instead of going completely naked.

she asked me why and i told her that many of the bathers would probably be a bit alarmed to see male genitalia in the bath house. she got mad at me and said sarcastically, ""thanks for your concern."" in the end she opted for the towel, but another friend overheard and said i was out of line for suggesting it. they both thought it was none of my business. i explained that not everyone is so accepting of her body and that i'm just trying to protect her from comments, stares, or worse.

they avoided me in the bath house after that although my friend did wear a towel around her waist the whole time. there were some looks but not as bad as if she didn't wear a towel.

i apologized afterwards to my trans friend and said i meant no disrespect. but she still seemed mad at me and are telling people that i am transphobic, although i do not believe that i am. aita?",3
"for accusing my brother of replacing my wife's refrigerated breast milk with cow milk?. my wife and i had our first baby a month ago. she prefers to pump a few bottles worth of milk at a time and feed the baby from the bottle. she stores the bottles in the fridge. 


my little brother has never had a girlfriend. he acts quite awkward around my wife and other women from what i've seen. he came to my house last week to see the baby and he noticed the bottles in the fridge. 


yesterday, my wife and i, along with our baby, went over to my parent's house. my brother knows since he's in our family group chat. he texted me when i was at my parent's house that he bought my baby some cool clothes and will drop them off. he knows my front door pin to get in. 


when i got home i saw the cool clothes he bought and thanked him via text. my wife bottle fed my baby that night with no issues. today, however, she said the baby reacted very differently to the new bottle she fed her. she coughed much more than usual and spat out the milk, which never happened before. so, my wife tasted it and said it was cow milk, not her milk. she told me to taste it too and compare it with the two other bottles in the fridge. that bottle indeed tasted much more like cow milk than the other two.


my wife suspected it was my brother drinking her breast milk and swapping out that bottle with cow milk. i agreed that it would not be out of character for him to do that. i thought it was a bit fishy he would come by and drop off clothes, especially since that was the first time he would come to my house when no one was home. 


i called my brother and asked him why he would drop by when we were not home and why he couldn't wait a few hours until we got home. he said he just bought the clothes from the nearby mall and it was more convenient to drop them off then. i asked him to please tell me the truth if he swapped my wife's breast milk with cow milk and he vehemently denied it. i told him how we found out the bottle contained cow milk and what a coincidence it must be. he said he really doesn't know, but i could hear the tremble in his words. i told him that my wife and i don't believe him and if he doesn't apologize now, we would tell our parents what happened and ask what they think. he once again denies doing anything so i hung up. 


before calling my parents, i want to know what you guys think first. are my wife and i just paranoid or do we have good enough reason to believe my brother swapped out her breast milk with cow milk?",3
"for not disciplining my daughter for laying into a nosy woman at church?. my wife and i have one 14 yo adopted daughter, sarah, which is relevant to the story. we recently found out that she has pcos, which i'd never heard of before. part of that is that she has a very large ovarian cyst that requires surgery to remove. the surgery is scheduled and happening soon. right now, she looks pregnant, which can't be easy on a teenager. 

between this illness and life in general, sarah can be... moody and nobody in life is immune to fits of anger. today at church, some woman decided that sarah was in fact pregnant, and that it was her chance at a free baby. sarah went off on her, calling her a ""barren bitch"", among other things, and causing a major scene that left that woman sobbing. 

my wife thinks that sarah has anger issues, and that we should punish her for not being sensitive. i don't agree.

first off, why is that woman entitled to say anything if sarah was pregnant? infertility doesn't make you exempt from social norms. i recognize that my wife and that woman have suffered, but they don't get to just do whatever. with her medical problems, sarah will probably be infertile herself, which i think puts her on par on that point. secondly, sarah lashed out in a rage due to mental and physical pain while provoked by an outrageous encounter. i don't know that that's the same as having ""anger issues"" or a personality problem. i've had physical fights over less. maybe that nosy woman needed to learn a lesson, and did.

for letting our daughter get off scot free?

ninja edit: sarah will have to be on oral birth control for her entire life, and may actually lose at least one ovary in this surgery. i'd say she qualifies for infertility on those grounds. i don't know how it wouldn't.",3
"for no longer wanting my trans cousin in my wedding party?. throwaway because my sister knows my reddit. 

i'm getting married next year and i'm so excited about it. my fiance has all his groomsmen picked out, and i'm in the process of asking my bridesmaids. i'd also have liked to include my twin cousins e and a in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. a is a guy and lives a few hours away. e is ftm, which i'm sad to say plays a major role in this aita. 

i drove out two weeks ago to visit a and ask if he'd be willing to be a part of the bridal party. i put together a box of goodies, and a card that said ""will you be a part of my bride tribe?"", deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. he was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and e's ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. i specifically asked him not to mention anything to e because i wanted it to be a surprise.

fast forward to this weekend and i meet e for lunch. i give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. e's reaction didn't go as i expected. he got really angry, accusing me of wanting to ""fit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold"" despite his transition. i tried to explain that i'd picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but i didn't get the chance because he kept talking over me. i feel like he went off the deep end. he called me bigoted, asked why i wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me ""basic"" and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. he left without giving me a chance to really explain.

i guess today e finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he'd be in the bridal party. i drafted a text message saying basically that while he's still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it's best if he isn't a part of the bridal party. my fiance says i should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think i'm being to harsh on e and should have seen this misunderstanding coming. she says i should be more understanding, considering the abuse/discrimination he must face. she says i should give e a second chance and if i don't it will cause all kinds of family drama.

would i be the asshole if i refuse to let him be a part of the wedding party?

eta: 
wow, i cannot believe how much this blew up. so i'm going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.

e sent me a text apologizing. his apology was for ""snapping at me"". he admitted he was wrong and it was ""totally out of line"" and now that he talked to a he knows what i meant and would be in the wedding party ""if i'd have him"". nothing specific was mentioned, and i haven't sent any response yet. 

a also did call me this evening, but i was out to dinner and missed his call. i called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.

also, e is a man. he uses the pronouns he/his/him. just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give anyone license to misgender him. if you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for e.",3
"for walking into my flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave?. i (20m) live in a flat with 5 others at university. there is one girl (20f), who's a bit of a...problem

she always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. very loud. and it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. we told security and they didn't do shit.

so we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. and yesterday, she does it again, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. we're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).

i have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.

i had had enough. i banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. i bang again and she doesn't open. so i try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.

so i walk in and see them having sex. they both quickly see me and freak out. she says to me ''what the fuck?!!'' but i look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. 

she keeps saying ''what the fuck?!! get out!!'' and i say to her ''i've had enough of your fucking shit. we've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. we're trying to sleep''. 

the guy is standing there awkwardly so i tell him ''get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so i tell him ''i'll fucking call security, and i've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. 

so the ''problem'' girl starts crying and i tell her that she needs to sort her life out, i then to say to her ''please leave this flat, move out. no one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.

i then leave and go to back to my room. i told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else i could have done. in fact they thanked me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, aita?

**to those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's not true. aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.**

**to the people telling me that i should have spoken nicely to her, i said in the first few paragraphs i already did this. me and the other flatmates asked her nicely to stop on several occasions and she didn't follow through. what she did was say ''okay'' and then continue to do the same shit. i'm writing this as a clarification for those comments.**",3
"for not wanting my in-laws to visit our new baby?. just to preface, my husband's brother has two kids, and his parents babysit them at least 3 days a week. i feel like this has kind of set the expectation for frequency of visits with grandparents. 

i just had a baby on july 10th, and my husband's mom has been over to visit us 5 times since then. i know she means well, but it's very stressful to have a newborn and to feel like i have to entertain also. it would be different if she was offering to help with something (not that i expect that of visitors, but people visiting new parents usually at least offer). she also seems to conveniently always come while he's napping (he naps for 2+ hours at a time at this point), and she leaves once he starts getting a little fussy, which is frustrating because any rest or chores i could get in while he's asleep don't get done. 

she texted me yesterday asking to come for a visit today. this is the first week my husband is back at work full time, and i'm trying to get in the groove of a new routine. i wrote her back and told her that i'm really not up for visitors this week because i'm getting settled in, and she freaked out and texted my husband asking what she did to offend me. she hasn't talked to me since yesterday after i wrote her, and she basically implied to my husband that we're being selfish keeping her grandson away from her. here?",3
"for feeding my vegan nephew meat?. my sister has been vegan for many years and she is also raising her son vegan. he has been vegan since birth. my nephew and son attend the same school so i pick them up from school everyday. my nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. 

i usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. a couple of months ago i left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew & son sharing chicken nuggets. i provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. i told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. his friends share their meals with him sometimes. i thought about telling my sister but decided not to. 

so basically i continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. usually he goes for the non vegan one. maybe because because he never gets to at home. i know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. she's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which i completely understand and respect. my husband thinks iata for not telling her and being dishonest, but i think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). 

so, aita? should i tell my sister what's going on?  ",3
"if i kick my boyfriend out of my house over chicken.. i love my boyfriend to death, but we have reached an impasse. i moved into my current house last year after i got a dog, specifically because i wanted her to have a huge backyard to roam around in. i bought her doggy door, and she loved it a few months later my boyfriend moved in from his apartment (though he still has the apartment) and was excited about the backyard because he always wanted chickens. he eventually bought 4 chickens and at first he kept them in an extra large dog cage, but let them free roam for most of the day. that was until we realized that my dog likes to chew there feathers off. so then the chickens had monitored outside time. then he decided that that wasn't fair to the chickens, and now won't let my dog have free access outside. he keeps her locked in her cage all day when i'm not home, and if she does need to go outside, he makes her put a muzzle on. she can no longer go outside and play with her toys, and my house is way too small for her to have room to play. he's even started scolding me even when i let her walk around inside without the muzzle inside, because he says if i'm not paying attention she might sneak outside and hurt the chickens.

&#x200b;

it's starting to piss me off because the backyard was for her. he doesn't even pay rent on my house. he refuses to make a properly gated area in the yard, even though there's plenty of room. when i remind him that my dog has a right to freedom in my house, he just reminds me on how bad the chickens look after she was done chewing them up. when i suggested him getting rid of the chickens, he says we can't because of all the missing feathers.

&#x200b;

at this point i think the only thing i can do is to ask him to leave, and take his chickens. i know he lives in an apartment, but at this point, that's his problem. if i asked him to move out?

&#x200b;

edit: okay, wow, i got way more responses then i ever dreamed of. i've been trying to read through them all. i feel like despite most saying i would n be ta. i think i agree with the people saying that kicking him out is too extreme. my birthday is next week, i think i'm going to ask if we could build some sort of containment for the chickens for it. also, yes i know i am a human doormat. been my whole life, i'm working through it in therapy.",3
"update: for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?. link to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/aja1al/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_girlfriend_because/

so the general consensus was that i was being a raging asshole, though a few thought i was just ignorant. it's been a while since i made that post, and my own conclusion is that i am probably both.

i've done a lot of thinking about my behavior that week and i've realized a lot of things. this isn't something that i wrote in my original post because it was off topic and sounded like i was just making excuses for myself, but my dad had passed away earlier that week and i had been in a terrible mood. i wasn't acting like myself at all. instead of coping in a healthy way, i'd been looking to my girlfriend for a pick-me-up and unfairly blaming her when she failed to deliver (for a reason completely out of her control).

the date wasn't really for her, it was for me, and that's what i'd been trying to avoid thinking about. i was behaving very selfishly and trying to convince myself that i was just upset because this problem had happened before. the truth was, her period getting in the way of dates had never really bothered me before this time around. i was just looking for reasons to justify my own anger.

that was extremely immature of me, to say the least.

i apologized to my girlfriend and, because she's an angel, she accepted the apology. because of the comments suggesting she may have a medical problem i asked her if she had pcos or endometris, and surprisingly enough, she said that she had never been examined for either.

we went to have her examined and it turns out that she has pcos, which essentially means she has cysts in her ovaries, which explains the irregular periods and extreme pain during them. so yeah, i felt horribly guilty about blaming her for that. luckily she has not seen some of the other symptoms of it (weight gain and hair growth) but she is pretty worried that they will appear. she'll be getting regular treatment from now on so i'm hopeful that she will see some relief soon.

tldr; i was being an ass because of my bad mood and it turns out my girlfriend has pcos. thankfully she forgave me and we are back to our normal, loving selves. thanks for the help, reddit.",3
"for /how/ i told someone i would not give up my handicap spot?. this is a throwaway account.

&#x200b;

for background, i (22f) am very petite, fit, and just by looking at me one would not guess i have a physical disability. 2 weeks ago, i had surgery with incisions on my spine and one butt cheek making walking more difficult temporarily. though, i have a handicap placard not just because i had surgery, but for the overall problem that me to be unable to walk long distances.

i'm not asking for refusing to give up my spot, but because of what i said. my brother thinks i went too far, but i think i afforded the woman the same amount of respect she gave me.

&#x200b;

i was going out to dinner with my brother (passenger seat.) i pulled into one of 4 handicap spots in front of a restaurant and the woman (late 60s) in the car to my right immediately opened her door to block my brother from getting out. we waited a few seconds, and it became clear this was intentional. i got out of the car and asked her if she would close her door.

&#x200b;

the woman immediately started berating me, saying i had no right to use the handicap spot as other people ""that actually need it"" would be unable to park. apparently, i am young and skinny enough to suck it up (though she doesn't know what my disability is) and deal with parking far away. she called me an entitled brat and accused me of ""scamming the government to support \my\ lazy ass,"" among other things. i told her a doctor saw fit i get a handicap placard, and when she said i look ""fine"" i told her that my medical history is none of her business. she continued to insult me, even calling me a lazy bitch at one point, and refused to close her door.

&#x200b;

i eventually had enough and let her have it. i told her something along the lines of, maybe if you didn't eat yourself into debilitating obesity others 'that actually need it' would be able to use your spot. she tried to respond by saying her weight was due to medical issues, to which i cut her off to say if she's going to make assumptions about me i will do the same. i called her a miserable old bitter bitch and told her at her big old age she should have learned to mind her business. she threatened to call the police on me for reasons she was unable to verbalize and i told her to go ahead and pointed to the restaurant we were going to and told her to send them in.

&#x200b;

when my brother heard this he finally crawled out of the driver's side. he said something like calm down and let's go inside, and i said that sounds like a great idea if the nosy bitch will leave us alone, but she seems too fat to follow up with the police and bring them inside. then we walked away with her still yelling things at me with her door open. she either didn't call the police or they refused to come.

&#x200b;

i know what i said was harsh but i'm pretty tired of people making assumptions about my pain and telling me about my pain. maybe i should regret it, but i don't have an ounce of remorse for what i said. aita?",3
"for inviting my sons entire class except for one child because of his autism?. my sons 10th birthday is next saturday and me and my husband have been planned a party for him. to make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and i had my son pass them out friday. we invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). except for one child well call david. 

the school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a ""normal"" class once a week. david is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. from what i know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and i have nothing against either of them. however, there have been incidents with david before. last year through friends i had heard that david had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. i don't know if i believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. there are other logistical problems as well (the party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end i decided to not invite david. 

well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. this got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. she told me that i am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. when i brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. i woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her.

just to be very clear, i was not asking if i am asshole for standing up for my friend, i stand by my actions 100%. i am trying to figure out if i should have done more to convince my parents to come rather than simply accepting they won't be there.

____________________

i (28f) am marrying my fiance (32m) in march.

i was in my parents home recently and i was telling them about our wedding party, which is going to include a male friend of mine as a groomsman. for some background. this male friend, we'll call him stephen, went to high school with me and is a post op trans man. my fiance said he'd love to have stephen as a groomsman, and i asked stephen and he was delighted!

then, i told my parents, and they were like ""oh we didn't realise she (yep, she) was going to be actually in the wedding. she'll be in all the photographs, we don't think that's appropriate""  so i was obviously instantly mad.they then said that they weren't going to be comfortable attending and being in all the photographs with her (yep, her again), and that i would need to remove stephen from the wedding party if i wanted them to come to the wedding. 

so i basically told them that if they weren't comfortable they didn't have to come. i left, came home and immediately transferred them the money for the wedding dress. i then get a phone call from my mother telling me that they will pay for the whole wedding if i remove stephen. basically bribing us. i just told her i needed space and i hung up.

that was 3 days ago and i haven't spoken to them. i'm shocked because they have never spoken ill of stephen before,! i'm upset that they would show so little respect to someone who is so important to me. i am also upset that they have so little respect for me that they think i would turn my back on a lifelong friend for money.

i don't know if i should speak to them in a few days when everything has calmed down, or if i should leave it to them. a few people i've spoken to have said i'm being a bit of an asshole because they're my parents, and they have a right to an opinion even if it's something i don't agree with. that i'll regret them not being at my wedding and that realistically it will ruin our relationship. i've had aunts and uncles calling me saying that this will tear our family apart and i'm being selfish. a cousin texted me to say that i'm choosing friends over family and that she and her parents won't be attending if my parents aren't, and the same for other members of the family. so it's basically blew up into this huge deal where a good portion of my family will likely not attend either! 

my view is that i don't think it's selfish to want to celebrate my day with everyone i love. i feel like the ball is in their court and they have the choice to come or allow their bigotry to stop them attending their only childs wedding! 

also to be clear i am 100% not removing stephen from my wedding or taking the money, i'm not considering either option (my fiance is in full agreement). but i just want to know if i'm the asshole for so easily accepting that my parents (and by default a lot of my family) won't be coming to my wedding?",3
"for telling a girl that she's not ""just being honest"", she's just being a bitch?. this just happened at lunch earlier and my one friend is telling me i went too far and making me second guess myself.  

there's this girl who is sort of part of my group of friends, but not really.  she eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that's it.  none of us hang out with her outside of school.  mostly because she's very insulting, all the time.  it's seriously like she doesn't know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  she just says ""i'm just being honest"" a lot. the problem is that she can't take a joke herself.  even polite criticism pisses her off a lot and makes shit super awkward.  my friends and i have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it's about her.  

today at lunch though i had enough.  she was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  ""are you sure you're not trans?  i've never heard of a guy being anorexic.""  and then, ""it's not attractive. just being honest.""   so i said, ""you're not just being honest, you're being a bitch.""  she asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  and i was like, ""no one thinks you're funny.  the only thing that's funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  take a look at yourself.""  

no one else was saying anything. she got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  i was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me i went too far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  ",3
"if i cancelled the adoption of my stepdaughter?. using throwaway 


so as the title suggests, i'm currently in the process of adopting my stepdaughter.



me and her mom have been married a year and the daughter was the product of a horribly abusive ex-husband. this abuser was still in their lives when we were dating and i used lawyers and the courts to slowly push him out where he has no control over their lives and he is starting to give up fighting the adoption because i'm set to win in a few months.



now because of personal issues of our own, my wife has just told me that she wants to file for divorce, but that she wants to wait until after i adopt our kid.



when i told her that i was afraid of adopting our daughter because of the child support i'll have to pay and not being a family anymore (which is why i wanted to in the first place) she had a full panic attack and accused me of leaving her in her abuser's control.



for info, the daughter is 5 and calls me dad.



so reddit, if i told my lawyer to stop the adoption process if i knew my wife was going to leave me after?


edit: wow this really blew up. to give answers to some repeated questions/comments:

yes i know the ex-husband is abusive for a fact, no this is not about the money her panic attack was about the control her ex has, and i will not even entertain the idea of suing for full custody myself.


edit 2: went out for a few drinks because i needed them because of all of this. 


wife had just been diagnosed with some mental struggles and her therapist urged her to allow the meds to take effect before she made a major life decision.


i was originally leaning towards adoption because i love that little girl and we get along almost better than her and her mom but after reading the almost 2400 comments at this point and roughly 200-300 pms i've decided to talk to a lawyer when i get home to make an informed decision.",3
"for getting annoyed with the a guy playing his guitar in a coffee shop?. i was sitting at a table in a coffee shop yesterday when this guy comes in to the shop carrying a guitar and orders a drink. he then happens to choose the space right next to my table to stand and play his guitar while waiting for his order. 

i find people who force their music on others very annoying. this guy and his guitar are no different from someone playing music from a bluetooth speaker in a public area in my mind. but i was lucky in this case - i didn't have to stick around. without speaking to the guy or even making eye contact, i stood up and moved to the complete opposite side of the shop to a new table by the exit. 

well the guy must have noticed my displeasure because he stopped playing after i moved. a few moments later he got his drink and moved towards the exit to leave. he opens the door to leave, pauses, then turns to me and says ""you could have just asked me to stop playing. treat me like a human being."" and then continued out the door before i could respond. 

so this guy is acting like i'm the asshole for not verbally engaging with a stranger who annoyed me. i feel like simply removing myself from the area when possible is usually the right play and leads to less conflict. aita?",3
"for leaving my toddler with my 'childfree' sister for a few minutes, resulting in a trip to the emergency room?. i (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that i can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. 

my 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. my sister and i have never really got on, when i got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks i force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). so, when i went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, i was shocked to find my sister there alone. i asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. 

my sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why i think this happened. i huffed because i was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. my sister rolled her eyes. i asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch tv until mom came back. my sister said 'absolutely not, i hate children and i don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. 

now, i completely understood this and i think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. i called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. my sister rolled her eyes and said 'fine, i'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. i was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. i didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.

so i left, and went for the bus. literally five minutes later i get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the er because she cracked her head open on the living room table. apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. 

i am absolutely raging at my sister. i don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. she argues that i 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which i feel i didn't. she says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but i feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

"for telling my daughter her ""child"" is not really my ""grandchild""?. my daughter (28) has gotten into dps and fostering, she has had her own child biologically but now plans to foster and adopt children. she has been fostering this 8mo for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they ""sort out"" their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. my daughter hopes to keep foster child. 

i am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when i asked to confirm the size of bio child, she asked me about foster child. i told her i didn't think to include her because she's foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. she said all grandchildren should be included. my thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. that would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. 

she went off on me and hung up and i am sitting here feeling horrible. i did not mean i do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but i thought i had a clear thought process? 

aita?

edit: i do care about this child, i'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. i just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.

final edit: i accept judgment and i commented on the person's comment that made me realize why i am in the wrong. they were to the point and just made it a simple question and i understood. 

i feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. i did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). maybe i should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, i apologize. 

accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. i am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - i'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. 

my daughter and i called her case manager and the photo idea including fc has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting fc or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.

thanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why i was in the wrong.

apparently, your super fertile after a loss and i ended up falling pregnant immediately after our loss and i'm currently 8 month pregnant with a boy. something my fiance really wanted.

i hate being pregnant. never enjoyed it. i hate even more how long i've been pregnant due to the back to back pregnancies. i'm miserable and i never want to be pregnant again.

in the unlikely event the baby i'm carrying now does also die i never want to be pregnant again. if the baby lives i never want to be pregnant again. i honestly can't explain how much i hate being pregnant. i love babies, children etc. not pregnancy. my eldest two girls and this baby are all c sections which is tough. i gave up work to be a sahm but i'm looking forward to when this one starts school and i can get back to work.
i hate how sick, tired and achey i feel. i'm short tempered with my other children. i'm fat and saggy. i poop constantly. my mental healths taken a complete beating - i've been in counselling for nearly a year now and feeling better though.

he is very against it. i don't feel comfortable doing something permanent that effects him too without his support but equilly ill never forgive him if i fall pregnant again. 

he says i'm making a decision based on anger that's i've essentially been pregnant for 14 months now.

if i agreed to be steralised - taking away also his choice of having any more children - because that's what i want?

also to add, we've discussed me using the coil but there's no birth control that's 100% effective.

edit: this has gotten more attention than i thought it would. i haven't had the chance to read all replies yet as been doing kids baths dinner etc, still need to get them to bed so will read every reply later.
just to answer a few questions that have come up so far. i wasn't sure how much info to add in my original post to not be rambly. 

fiance had always said as one of 4 he loved the madness and would want 4. i always said 4 was too many but we said we'd see how we feel after 3. we had never anticipated a still born and that steralisiation would be an option.

this past year he's been my absolute rock. he also lost a baby, but he had to hold it together while i fell apart. he's a fantastic father. this isn't a walk away from our family matter.

he's a bit of a stereotypical man in that he doesn't do talking about feelings, this is how he's always been and i accept that. he has so many other fantastic qualities. an example would be when choosing the music for our daughters funeral. he simply refused to pick. it upset him too much. you could say this is an ass hole move, however while i sat inside crying he was outside on the tranmpoline with our other 2 young children making them shriek with laughter, protecting them as best as he could.

i know in a way this is above this sub, because he's not an asshole, but i didn't want relationship advice. i just wanted to know if i would be crossing a line by doing it without his full support.

if i say i'm getting it done, he won't stop me. but he will resent me. if i don't get it done, i will resent him. 

his main concern is that its extra surgery with extra risks. second that i'm not my usual self (i'm not - i am a raging hormonal mess, with a dose of ptsd, anxiety and depression to boot thanks to our loss - however i have a fantastic counsellor and things have greatly improved). third he says there's other forms of contraception that isn't permanent. forth is my age. 

and i've had 2 c sections. 1 emergency, 1 planned. our stillborn was delivered naturally as she was premature and small so not the same risks. i have my third c section booked for the end of the month. i need to give an answer on wednesday if i want the tubal tie at the same time and we are still in disagreement, so one of us will be upset. i wanted to see if i was being an asshole for choosing my choice, of permanent steralisiation over his suggestion of the coil. 
so far it seems from comments that i'm not and i really appreciate all the replies. i will read them all xxx

edit 2. guys i was asking if i would be an asshole not if fiance is an asshole and i'm beginning to feel very protective over him with some of the comments. i'm not a baby factory in the same way he's not a sperm doner. we love each other and respect each other we just have a difference of opinion on a huge matter and we've ran out of time. whilst i'm really pleased it seems everyone is agreeing with me he's a good guy too. everything he does is for us. he's hardworking, loving and fun. he helps me with the kids after a day of manual work. he does baths and the park. he rubs my back, sends me off for baths when i ache. let's me sleep in, or nap due to pregnancy tiredness.
leaving us over this wouldn't of even entered his mind nor is it a concern of mine. we survived a stillbirth while raising 2 other young children, as a team, filling their life with joy despite the pain. we can survive anything if we've made it through the last 18 odd months x",3
"for ""allowing"" my 16yo daughter to get a tattoo?. my daughter is 16, and will be 17 in august.  in september, i'm going to move her across the country because she will be starting college at a very good school (she skipped a grade, graduated hs a year earlier than her peers).  

&#x200b;

last week my daughter graduated hs.  we packed up her room (the essentials) from her mom's house (divorced) as she wont be going back to live there...we're going straight from my house to her college dorm.  a few days ago, my daughter asks me for a ride to my friend tony's house because she is getting a tattoo.  i was surprised because she never mentioned this to me before. it was definitely framed to me as if this was already approved, she just wanted to go with me to get it done. we stayed up all night looking at designs, coming up with colorways/shading, and deciding on location.  the next day we went to tony's and she got a small 2"" x 4"" tattoo above her ankle.  i've known tony since high school, he's been a tattoo artist for 20 years.  i completely trust everything he's associated with when it comes to tattoos.  he even did my first tattoo when we were in high school.  the entire experience was actually a blast for me.  i haven't felt that close to my daughter in years, we really bonded over the whole thing.  to see the guy who gave me my first tatt also give her her first made me shed a tear.  

&#x200b;

of course the next day she posts pics online, and her mom flips her shit.  she calls me screaming about how irresponsible i am.  i honestly didn't know her mom wouldn't be ok with it.  she has tried her hardest to cut me out of all decision-making about daughter, so the norm is they make the decisions amongst themselves and i'm just sometimes along for the ride (and to pay).  she's also cut me out of multiple milestones in daughter's life.  graduations, performances, games, etc.  until daughter was old enough to tell me directly, i was never invited so i missed a lot of moments.  

&#x200b;

obviously daughter was aware of this, which is why she simply stated to me ""i'm getting a tattoo"" instead of asking me.  i definitely reprimanded her for misleading me, but otherwise, whats the big deal?  wife has been ok with her having sex since 13, picked her own high school and college, is fine with her moving across the country in a few months to attend and live by herself.  why are we acting like she is not capable of deciding this on her own?  would it be better if she gets it done 5 months from now from some shitty kid doing tatts out his dorm room with used needles?  

&#x200b;

mom is livid.  she threatened to call the police.  threatened to pick up daughter and bring her back to her house.  tried to make me take her to get the tattoo removed.  none of this is happening.  a culture was created in which i don't get input on things regarding daughter.  a culture was created in which mom allowed daughter to make decisions for herself.  here for not double checking with mom that a tattoo is ok?",3
"for eating my all of wife's toblerone, then buying a new one?. yesterday a mutual friend came over and gave her a gift of a toblerone from his holiday in switzerland. she agreed i could have some so i did. she's out for a for days and my temptation got the best of me, so i ate the rest of an almost full packet.

she has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so i assumed it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some of the chocolate left for her. fuck, it was already gone, so i've just rushed to the shop to get a new one in expectance that i'm a dead man when she gets back. 

she once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so i'm not taking chances.

toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. not sure if i should put it in the swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that i bought i new one. for now i'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. i'm in the uk btw, so the recipe is exactly the same as the one's in switzerland.

also, she religiously reads this sub, so if she comes across this - g, i love you and i hope you forgive me like you did with the pasta.

"for telling my girlfriend that if she wanted to be a surrogate for a friend of hers that i no longer wanted to continue the relationship?. my long time girlfriend told me recently that she is interested in being the surrogate for a child for a friend of hers who is gay and wants a child of his own.

i respect her desire to help and i told her: ""this is your body, and i don't think i have a say in what you can or can't do with it. that being said, if you want to be the surrogate for him, i don't think i would want to continue this relationship any further.""",3
"for kissing my ex-girlfriend before her parents pulled her off life support?. about a year ago, my ex-girlfriend (i'll call anna) was involved in a terrible car accident. she received over 20 injuries (lacerated liver, broken ribs, punctured lung, bruised lung, left foot torn off, just to name a few). she had to be flown to the city to receive treatment. i was devastated to  hear her go through this.  despite all the efforts, she was kept on a ventilator (per her parents wishes) and never woke up. 

after months of visiting anna, sitting by her, i was getting drained. her parents eventually told me (in a very kind way) that she would want me to find someone new and that i shouldn't let this be the end of my 'dating career' (i am 20yo). so after a lot of therapy and reaffirming my belief and faith in god, i put myself back out there. i eventually met a new girl who i loved (katie), and i saw a lot of traits in her that i saw in my ex. 

a few days ago (may 2), the parents decided to pull her off life support. at first i was extremely upset, but realized anna would want this; to end her suffering and her families). katie knew about anna and it was no surprise to her i wanted to be there when she was taken off life support. when i got there, i kissed anna's forehead, ran my hands through her hair, and told her i loved her. after the the doctors removed her tube, it was extremely emotional for all the family and me. i kissed her again (on her lips, and just whispered again ""i love you). 

at the funeral i gave her a eulogy (which katie attended) and told anna again ""i love you.""

after the funeral, katie was angry with me. she asked what i mean't when i said ""i love you, anna."" then i told her about the kiss  because i felt guilty. now, katie is now super pissed at me. she is staying with her parents and said i cheated on her. this was not my intention at all though, i just wanted anna to know (if she was even conscious) that i loved her, and would see her again. the kiss was not 'romantic' or 'sexual', it was just a final goodbye, i wanted more than to just touch her hand once last time.

"for not caring when my friend came out of the closet?. my friend is obviously gay. he does nails with the girls, he follows make-up tutorials on youtube, speaks in a higher tone of voice, and flails around a lot. he also gushes with the girls in our group when they bring up k-pop celebs (guys) and joins them for shopping when we split up at the mall.

we (the guys) know he's gay, the girls most certainly do, and it's pretty much an open secret at this point. nobody ever brings it up, and we basically just treat him like another girl.

so we're at school, it's lunchtime and we're all chilling in the cafeteria. he suddenly comes out of the closet and announces (to the guy-table) that he's gay. we're playing cards at the time, and our responses ranged from: ""cool,"", to ""finally...,""

well apparently, we didn't show enough support because he seemed upset that we weren't caught completely by surprise.

him: why can't you people just accept me for who i am?

(we stare at each in confusion)

me: uh... we don't care. you're gay? fine. it's none of our business. (shrug)

him: it's 2019. it's not okay to hate on gay people anymore. (he storms off)

girl 1: (kicks my leg) what the hell's your problem?

me: everybody already knew he was gay.

girl 1: soooo??? you could've showed that you were happy for him! god! (kicks my leg again)

me: kick me again, i dare you. (spoiler: she doesn't)

the guys at the table give me a mixed bag of: ""you done fucked up now boi /s"" and ""shut up, let's play. lunch is almost over""

"for refusing to allow my daughter to participate in high school cheerleading?. i have a son thats entering 8th grade and a daughter thats entering 9th grade.  both of them have always been bookworms.  very studious and cerebral, just like their dad.  i also played sports all through school and i value the experience that brings.  i've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  i tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  we dont know til we try?  even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   my wife insisted i back off.  fair enough.  

&#x200b;

now my daughter is entering high school and wants to become a cheerleader.  she has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  she actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  but one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  she's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in high school because she was ""a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.""

i said no.  i dont appreciate that reasoning.  my wife explained that i dont ""know what its like to be a girl in high school"" and i say ok?  hows that relevant?  i also dont appreciate cheerleading.  its too dangerous.  girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  we don't have the insurance to cover it.  lastly, i dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  my wife says i'm focusing on the bad and not the good.  most girls dont get injured.  i'm the pervert because i'm making it sexual.  i pushed for her to join a sport.  i let my son play sports.  she'll have a much better high school experience.

she came back after a week and did not stop talking about how amazing the vacation was. apparently she did that to help me vicariously enjoy the vacation. i was really pissed. my sister and my family supported me. but my wife did not. she later told me that she was too  stressed and depressed to be around me and watch me suffer. 

now, my wife is down with flu. and i've been helping her. but i think i should help her vicariously enjoy europe because it's one of her favorite destinations. i just want her to know how i felt. of course, i won't go, but i plan on acting like i did. when i told my sister this, she told me that i should not get back at her and forgive her and lead by example. i don't think so. i think i'm feeling the stress now. here?

my mil (mother in law) decided to tell my daughter that she didn't get as many gifts as my brother and that we spent less on her.

"for not going to my sisters wedding because of the ridiculous ""requirements"". so, i'm in the middle of a shitstorm and need some advice on if i'm wrong.

&#x200b;

my sister is getting married in less that 3 weeks. i haven't been involved in the planning as i have my own life but from what my mom has relaid to me it's been a nightmare. my sister want's a ""fancy"" wedding and is micro-managing everything. i have no idea how normal this is but from what i've heard she broke down crying when her fiance bought the wrong shade of white napkins. her and both my and the grooms parents have invested a lot of money into this too the tune of over 50k.

&#x200b;

in my opinion i think the whole ordeal is ridiculous but it's not really my place to say anything. at least until yesterday. a email was sent out to everyone invited to the wedding with ""attendance requirements"". these requirements were a joke. some of them were just nonsensical like what color ties are and aren't allowed or that no one can talk to the wife or groom alone. but some were absurd like the fact that no one is supposed to take pictures except the photographer for the whole event, no facial hair will be allowed or you will not be pictured, or that any women with shoulder length or longer hair must have it cut or wear it in a pony tail. the worst though were the ""gift requirements"". according to the email a gift of 300$ value or more must be given (or $250 cash) or you will not be allowed into the venue. the email also ends with ""those who choose not to follow these rules will be asked to leave. please think of the bride and groom's wishes during this stressful time""

&#x200b;

this is a joke, right? like i can understand micromanaging but that's just absurd. i called my mom to make sure this was not a late april fools joke and it was real. i told her that i won't be going because of this. that was wrong apparently because my sister has been blowing me up saying that i'm being selfish and that i'm ruining ""her day:. my parents agree with her and say i'm being an asshole. my parents have told me that they will pay for my gift but i still think that all of these rules are a joke.

"for refusing to pay for my step-daughter's expenses after she got pregnant?. my husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as an. an's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. an is now 16 years old, and pregnant.

an stays mostly with us because i am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition. it had always been my husband who pays for an's expenses.

when an turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(hs) in the big city we live in. we checked on hs and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private hs. she has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. i have been separating some money for this purpose, too.

my husband and i came to an agreement that i would also help her dream to come true, but i would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (an did not know this) and he agreed. this conversation took place two years ago... and now, an is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.

i laid some facts down to an, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. i recommended she terminated the pregnancy.

an's mom is ecstatic and so is her grandma. they have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". i think they're absolute loonies; i bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. i believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

i am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money i've been saving in other stuff if an decides to carry on with the pregnancy. i have not and will not make the ultimatum of ""terminate or i'll stop paying your tuition"", but i will tell her that i won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. i don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. i firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. money will go to some of the child's expenses and i will give no more. an can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.

my husband is telling me i need to understand the situation. i do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill i will die on. i can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but i feel like i'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something i shouldn't. husband firmly believes i am doing this to punish an and i am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. aita?

&#x200b;

**edit/commonly asked questions:** ann will not stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. i will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but i also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (i still need to make a budget, but i don't think i will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).

no, i will not make an ultimatum. i haven't spoken to ann about this situation. i plan on telling her i can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. she still will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. if father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.

i will definitely not pay for the private university. the country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. i am not closing her educational options. i may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to lse, for example) but i am not giving her the worst.

finally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. that would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.

**another edit because forgot to add:** ann was supposed to be on the pill. gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. she stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the ""natural"" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. husband and i have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but i'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point i just want to fist fight bio mom.",3
"for teasing my wife about finally catching her shitting?. ok so this is kind of a weird situation. my wife is one of those super prim and proper chicks. like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. you don't ever catch her doing anything ""impolite"", whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. i've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter. 

she had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. she wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so i had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about ""needing privacy to pee"", i'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done. 

well she had been in there for a while, and i'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. so i went in there and sure enough she was. i teased her and was like, ""see! i knew you shit too!"" she got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so i left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. she was real emotional so i shut up about it for a while. well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so i figured i could finally tease her again.

every once in a while i'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and i'll be like ""still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. man that was awful, i could smell it from in here!"" she always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when i brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. i told her it's just funny because it's the only time i got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. but i kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said i was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. so aita? i'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her.

it's working. it's just frustrating for ally because she should know a lot of this stuff. but her mom is very, very controlling. i expect i am going to do this with my other niece savannah when she graduates in a few years.

i have been running my own business for six years now. i took it over from my mother when she retired. my brother has no interest in the business, though he was offered some stake.   
my mother ran the business for 37 years before i took it over. she hired a woman named belladonna \54f\ who has worked there for 24 years. as such, belladonna feels she is pillar for the company and has asked to become a manager. she has tried to take on managerial roles before, but i wouldn't give her that job if someone paid me.   
she is a little snarky, but i had no issue with it. until i caught her calling ally ""cinderella"" and ""princess."" she was also ordering ally to get her coffee. when ally said she was working on something, belladonna told her ""well, i guess you just sit down and do nothing then.""   
i fired her on the spot.   
my mother thinks i was an asshole for doing that. but i don't tolerate people who think being older means they have a right to be snarky. i told people what ally was doing at the job, and that she was not an intern. she was simply my niece assisting me on stuff i needed help with.

"aita? i (21f) just had an abortion and my bf (29m) thinks i'm overreacting. hi all, i'll try to make this as brief and unbiased as possible.
i  met my bf a year ago, we have always had protected sex ( i'm on the pill and he wears a condom). i have no idea what happened but i still managed to get pregnant. i immediately decided to get an abortion.
i asked my bf if he could come and support me through the procedure. he said he didn't want to take a day off. full disclosure if it gives insight: he works from home taking contracts as a programmer, makes $150k a year and can take off whenever he feels like it.

so whatever, he told me he wasn't coming and that i had to take care of it. this was a week ago. the procedure was yesterday and it went as well as can be expected. i went to his house afterwards and he told me he had a surprise for me: it was a small, child sized bowl with cutesy animals on it. i thanked him but mentioned that this was maybe not the best gift as i just had a tough day and was emotional at best. 
he then told me he had a wonderful day with his family and proceeded to show me a video of his father and nephew doing egg hunts together and the father teaching the nephew to wash his hands, etc.
so i immediately started bawling because i just terminated a pregnancy ( it wasn't wanted and i don't regret it, but it doesn't mean i feel sensitive about it). he became very cold and asked me to stop crying, saying that i was overreacting and he was just trying to make me feel better. he didn't apologize and we went to bed upset. i woke up in the middle of the night because i was cramping and sore, so i went on his couch and had a good cry. apparently that woke him up because he came to ask me if i was going to continue crying for long and told me to turn off the lights asap because i was being inconsiderate.

aitah? i feel like he doesn't give a rats ass about me and is being disrespectful, he says it's the 'pregnancy hormones' making me whiny.

after work, i like to come home, greet my boyfriend who's usually relaxing on the couch, and change into my gym clothes. while i'm changing in the living room, we usually talk about our day. well today, i started telling him about an annoying co-worker while i was topless. out of nowhere, he abruptly stops me and curtly says, ""don't talk to me when you're naked"". i was really taken aback by this. embarrassed, i went into the bedroom to dress in peace.

angrily, i came out and asked my boyfriend why he suddenly had a problem with me being naked. before i get into his reasoning, i will admit that i am naked quite a bit. for instance, after i shower i like to do a naked kermit style dance to dry off in front of him. anyway, his discomfort is that seeing me naked all the time makes it less special when we have sex. he even mentioned that this issue came up in seinfeld and that jerry would side with him. i don't know about this, i feel like i have a right to be naked, but i don't want him to feel uncomfortable either.

anyway, should i let my fur flag fly or aita??

update: before i dive in, you guys really came through with the solid advice! thank you! ok, so after this incident i decided to cool off and go to the gym. when i got home my boyfriend sheepishly greeted me. i coldly said ""hi"" and sat on the couch to play on my phone. while i'm sitting, he walks over to me and without saying a single word, begins to start stripping! he gets butt naked, picks up my free weights and starts doing lunges, squats, bicep curls, you name it! i watched him in silence until we both couldn't take it anymore and started laughing. he then apologized, saying he doesn't have a problem with my nudity, he just doesn't like to have prolonged conversations when i'm naked. i understand where he's coming from, so we agreed that any conversation longer than 5 minutes will require a shirt. tough, but fair.

thank you again for your helpful comments! they were really thoughtful and made me think deeper about how i was making him uncomfortable. in terms of saying that me being naked all the time makes sex less special, he said it was a dumb comment that he only said in anger. i accept this.

i'm also a bit obsessed with all the seinfeld comments. jerry is absolutely an asshole and using him to argue your point is hilarious. now kramer on the other hand...

and thank you to everyone who supports my kermit dance! i will confidently dance dry after my shower tonight. but for no longer than 5 minutes. i know the rules.",3
"for specifically ordering food my wife hates so i don't have to share?. yeah so i'm basically joey from friends before anyone states the obvious. i really really hate sharing food when i order out at restaurants or takeout. i always order just enough for myself so when someone grazes off my plate it makes me unreasonably upset. 

so my wife is a terrible food snatcher. she always says she's not that hungry and orders a small side or nothing at all, then slowly devours the food i've ordered. so many times i've ordered steak and fries just to end up competitively eating fries with her as we both race to get the last fry. i ask her to order her own stuff but she'll say she's not that hungry or my food looks better, etc. 

anyways in the past year i've found a good trick where i simply order dishes with one ingredient she hates (cilantro, anchovies, carrots, or chilies) and she won't touch any of it. recently some family members discovered i do this and called me a massive asshole. they called me childish for not sharing food with a spouse but honestly i'm just sick of not being able to eat a whole meal. aita?

**edit**: to those asking if i've told her to stop, i do, all the time, but it's honestly worse because then she sits there and eyes my food sadly. or she'll sigh and push her own plate around and ask, sadly ""so how's your food? it looks really good..."" or she waits until i'm taking a break to ask me multiple times if i've finished and if she could now have a bite, in the saddest voice possible like she's begging for scraps. it just feels super disconcerting when someone is so focused on me eating my meal.

i like just getting something she has no interest in cause then i can eat in peace, and that usually forces her to order something else for herself as well.",3

my first post wasn't hugely popular but i wanted to update anyways.

after what happened with my parents, i won't lie, i relapsed. 

i had a weekend where i blacked out. i remember getting back to my apartment and all the drugs and booze i had bought was gone. and it was a monday morning. it was a lot of stuff. 

i scared myself so much i ended up calling my parents saying that they were right and i remembered everyone's advice on my last post and i apologized for how i treated them and that they were right in not giving me any of their money. 

i'm now three weeks sober and i took reddit's advice and made a compromise with my parents in regards to my inheritance.

if i remain at least 5 years sober and submit to a bi monthly drug test, they will reconsider my part of the money. i hope they do reconsider. 

i know i have a lot of work to do and i still have a lot of selfishness to overcome but i wanted to thank everyone for helping me try to realize that.

"for refusing to get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name even though i have one of my sons name?. i have a tattoo of my sons name which i got when he turned 1. i've never had a tattoo after that. met the love of my life 22 years ago, she had a 4 year old daughter, and i honestly truly love her like my own. 

recently my wife's best friend noticed my tattoo (it's on my chest so usually covered up) and she asked my wife if i had a tattoo of my stepdaughters name. 

my wife said no, and her friend is convinced this is a huge sad imbalance and is unfair to my daughter etc. she told my wife this, and my wife agrees now and thinks that i should get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name to be fair. 

i don't want to do it at all, and i keep saying no, but my wife thinks a 'real dad' would get tattoos of both. i got a bit upset at that comment and told her i was a real bloody dad. i asked my daughter and she said 'i don't want a tattoo of my name, but if you are getting a tattoo for me i want you to get a cat' .... i love her very much but i'm not getting a freaking cat on me either. 

my wife is very sensitive about the fact that our daughter isn't biologically mine, i absolutely 0% care as my stepfather raised me and he is the best dad in the fucking world. i love my daughter and she loves me.

am i the asshole for refusing to get this tattoo?

edit: a user pointed out i should explain why i got my tattoo. i got his name because he was premature and they told us he had a high probability of dying, the fact he didn't was a medical miracle. i was celebrating the first year of his birth because that was the biggest hurdle to get through. never saw any need to get any tattoos after that.",3
"for telling strangers that my wife and i are married?. my wife gets upset when i do this but i feel like i'm in the right here. if we are at a bar or a party, we usually go our own separate ways to socialize. i'll notice that she'll be talking to a guy that neither of us have met before and i can see on his face that he's into her. so i'll head over to where she's at and grab her, give her a kiss and compliment her. something like ""she's so funny. that's why i married her."" then i leave so she can continue talking. almost every time, the guy ends up leaving after i do. she's never really flirting with these guys, just talking sports or politics. but she's beautiful and very smart and she has a knack for being very personable so they assume she is flirting. she says all she is trying to do is have a conversation with a stranger but i'll i'm doing is letting people know we are married. if it was just a conversation, they should still be able to talk to her even though she's taken. aita?",3
"for asking my husbands sister to consider being a surrogate for us?. my husband and i have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. it took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. with that in mind, my husband and i came to his sister (sarah) with a proposal.

sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. my husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. with that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.

we invited sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. we told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. we told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.

sarah exploded at us. she said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. she actually left early. right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. my husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind sarah's difficulties. my parents think she is behaving awfully. most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much sarah hates kids.

it's really weighing on my mind and i honestly never expected this kind of outcome. she literally blocked us on every platform she could. are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",3
"for confronting my kids private school teacher about blue blood?. so this happened about a year ago but i'm curious. my wife said i drug it out too far and was an asshole. 

so my kid comes homes from school telling me he learned something new at school, and he was excited. so i was excited too and asked him what. he said ""we learned our blood is blue today!"". 

i felt a little bad but said to him ""you know i was told that as a kid too, but i've learned that's actually not true."". i said i can show him evidence from the internet when we get home. we get home and i show him and he believes me. 

the next day he goes to school and tells his friends and even the teacher that that was incorrect. his teacher tells him no, i am the one who is wrong not him. my kid even said he believes his teacher. so i show my son more proof that i am right, but he is still skeptical.  

the next day i compose a nice email, not rude. simply stating i told my son we didn't have blue blood and he told me that you told him i am incorrect. i give him some links showing we don't have blue blood.  

he emails me back saying i am still incorrect. at this point my wife asks me to drop it. i am upset and i don't want to drop it. as of now my own kid does not believe me, even after showing him proof. 

so i email the teacher again and ask him if he can provide me evidence that he is correct because i cannot produce anything showing he is correct. he finally relents and says i must be right. 

but at this point, i now need him to tell my son he was incorrect so my son will believe me.  my wife asked me to please stop but i didn't. i emailed him asking him to please tell my son and the classroom that he was incorrect so they don't go through life with incorrect information. 

he did tell the kids he was wrong and that's the end of that. 

now i feel that i have taught my son a few good lessons.  a) it's ok to question things including those authorities b) it's ok to stand behind what your beliefs are especially with evidence c) it's ok to be wrong(the teacher) we can all be wrong, but when presented with proof, it's ok to change your opinion based on evidence.

was i an asshole for dragging it out?

edit. to those calling me an asshole? what is the best way to handle this then? i'm serious, genuinely curious of the proper way to handle this?

edit: well this blew up. i'll accept my nta. but these people telling me my reasons for doing this are self centered? nope. couldn't care less. but i wanted my kid to challenge authority, absolutely, and to stand by your convictions.

final edit: showed the wife this. she said that i was correct in following through. but i was the asshole because she had to listen to me complain about this guy at home for days. 
thanks for the conversations though!",3
"for asking to be charged for a man's haircut when i am a woman. i am a butch lesbian and for the past 12 years i have had a short, men's style haircut. i'm not talking about a pixie cut that requires a lot of styling and time. my sides are buzzed fairly short with the top a bit longer. it usually only takes about 10- 15 minutes for me to get a haircut. during that time every salon i've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut. this has always annoyed me and i don't enjoy paying almost double what men with the exact same haircut as me pay.

recently i moved and yesterday i went to a new shop for my monthly trim and i decided to try something new. i asked if i could be charged the $22 for a men's cut rather than $40 for a woman's cut. the woman at the counter looked like i slapped her. she called a manager and the stylist over and they seemed shocked by the suggestion. they talked about it among themselves and then told me it wasn't possible. i pushed back and explained my reasoning and all they would say was they don't charge by style. 12 years of frustration boiled over and i ended up leaving. i was never rude or mean, but i still feel bad that i wasted a stylist's appointment.

for asking? leaving? being annoyed at what i see as a double standard?

i've thought about going to a barber, but i live in a conservative part of the country and i worry about a negative reaction there and every salon i've ever gone to explicitly caters to men as well.",3
"for being upset about my wife selling her engagement ring?. i got engaged to my wife when we were 26, we had been dating for 7 years.

i got her engagement ring engraved to say ""semper amemus"" which means let us always love, i spent all my savings on her engagement ring and even took a loan out to buy it, it seems silly now but i love her and she deserves the best.


we got married at 30, adopted our first child at 32, second child at 35 and now we're both 40.

i recently found out she pawned her engagement ring for £1,200, i spent over nine thousand on her ring.


she's telling me she's got a bunch of pictures of it and she isn't a jewellery person anyway which is true in all the years i've known her she's only worn her crucifix and engagement/wedding ring, the wedding ring means everything to her but she doesn't have any attachment to the engagement ring.

"for forbidding my father in law from seeing my kids until he stops his behavior. my father in law is the king of passive aggressive comments and passing judgement on other people's lives. he particularly disapproves of the fact that i work, send the kids to daycare, and expect my husband to contribute to the household equally in spite of the fact that he makes more than i do. if my father in law had it his way, i would be waiting on my husband and kids hand and foot at all times. 

his recent tactic of snarky comments has been to say that everything we own or pay for is done with my husband's money. if i buy my husband a gift, fil says, ""is it really a gift if you're spending his money?"" if i pay for my fil's coffee, he says, ""well, really your husband is paying for this."" it's annoying and frustrating. i tried being snarky back, didn't work. i tried talking to him about it and he just pretended he didn't know what i was talking about.

the final straw was that my kids have started saying it. i mentioned to my husband that i was going to get my hair cut and my son pipes up with, ""so you're going to go waste dad's money on yourself?"" and both kids start laughing. my husband told them that they were being rude and they defended themselves by saying that grandpa says it all the time! apparently he's taken to telling the kids behind my back that i'm wasting my husband's money on myself every time that i buy anything for myself. one of my kids straight up called me greedy and selfish.

i'm livid and i want to ban my father in law from seeing my kids until he admits to what he's been doing, apologizes, and actually stops doing it. my husband is onboard for the most part, but his mother and siblings are telling us that this is just how he is and it's not that bad and we can just teach our kids otherwise. are we assholes if we kick him out of our kids lives until he stops being such a jerk and poisoning my kids against me?",3
"for making a baby cry to save $100?. okay hear me out.

so today i took my baby over to my parents' house for dinner, without my wife. we have a five month old, she's home with the kid all day while i'm at work and needed a break—so i went with the baby. works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and i bring her home a doggie bag with dinner.

on the way home, around 10pm, i made a left in a no left. it saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. it's a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger.

of course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and i get pulled over. here in ontario, 'disobey a sign' is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how i know…).

baby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. so just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, i just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. baby woke up and starting screaming. when i rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way.

baby was perfectly fine. i gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. we're home now and she's asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. i felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so i moved $100 (what i would have paid for the ticket) into the kid's resp (university fund).

'my wife was absolutely furious when she found out' is what i might say if i was a complete idiot and had told her.

"for doing the same thing as my wife?. my wife recently decided she doesn't want to give oral anymore. her reason is that she doesn't like it and so doesn't think she should have to do it. ofcourse she's right, no one can force her to give oral, and she's entirely within her right to refuse oral to me.

that said, i've always hated having friday night dinners with my in-laws. my in-laws are nasty judgemental people and for the last 10+ years i've spent almost every friday night - when i should be relaxing from a long week's work - with people that i honestly detest on some level. why do i do this? because it makes my wife happy and i want her to be happy.

so i told my wife that's fine - she doesn't have to, but that i'd also like to stop doing something which i hate - spending every friday with my in-laws.

what made me mad was that from time to time my mom (f59) makes comments about how she raised my sister and i as a single parent. i disagree and tell her that she raised us half of the time while the other half we were raised by our dad (m58). she then says that he didn't do much and that we were raised by a single mom who did everything for us.

now i already know my girlfriend loves shiny things, but now she is absolutely adamant that she wants a real diamond ring. personally i don't like the idea of shelling out so much money for a piece of jewelry with an artificial high price. so instead i offered to buy her one that was lab-grown, as it's way cheaper but also doesn't involve shady business practices and labor. 

money isn't an issue, it's really about the ethics for me. i do not like the idea of buying her something that potentially harmed someone in the making of it for our wedding. but she thinks i'm being stingy for not buying her a ""real"" diamond. we've already gotten in a few arguments over this so now i wanted to ask you guys if i should just suck it up or not.",3
"for objecting to ""female employee only"" parking spaces at my workplace?. so theres not too much to say, i guess i'm more curious in others opinions on this.  i am an approx 22.5 year old man, i recently snagged a really really good job.  i work as a corporate level administrator in the trucking industry.  it's been a pretty sweet gig so far and have no complaints as of yet (2 months in). i would also like to preface the following with saying that i work with a very diverse staff of coworkers who are all as professional as they can be, rarely is it that someone cant pull their own weight. 

about a week ago i was walking through the parking lot to my car after the end of the day, and i was looking at the sunset through the chain link fence.  as my eyes darted around i happened to notice a pink metal plate bolted onto the fence, i thought to myself ""woah, what's that and how did i not notice it before?"" so i started reading it and i was immediately greeted with slight disappointment.  basically, it read as follows ""female employee parking space only!"" with a large symbol in the middle of the sign which is also seen on women's public bathrooms.  

now, let me clarify i am not ""irate"" or ""fuming"" about it, but i dont really buy into the whole chivalry, white knighting culture that the men of previous generations upheld *fedora intensifies*.  i even asked my fiance when i got home, just to get a female insight on it.  she said she thought it was stupid.  i guess i'm just coming from the territory of you can show that your a diverse company dedicated to equality, without making tedious or unimportant decisions like special parking.  just my two cents on it though.

while i was standing near the cash register waiting for my order, the woman stepped up and ordered a $4 coffee. i kindly offered to pay and she seemed so grateful and even thanked me twice. right after, she turned back to the cashier and said, ""in that case, you can add two extra shots and a blueberry muffin.""

i was so taken aback, i immediately told the cashier that i changed my mind and she could pay for her own order. i walked over, picked up my drink and left without another word. 

for reneging on my offer? 

edit: i want to thank everyone so much for responding. the only thing i'd like to clarify is that i felt bad about it afterwards. she could have intended to pay for the add-ons, it could have been a joke, etc. i didn't communicate with her very well because i fell into a trap of assuming the worst. if she looked at me expectantly to pay, i would clearly not be an asshole. it was more my quick response of which i was unsure.

for some reason, she likes picking on my breasts. she is always saying passive aggressive stuff like ""well, it's not like you'll ever feel real back pain, considering how small your tits are"", one time she picked up my bra when we were in the changing room after gym and said ""do you really fit in this? god your tits are tinier than i thought!""; ""can you really not pick up stuff with your underboob? that's insane how small they are!""; ""how will you nourish kids if you ever have them lmao""; ""if i were your boyfriend, i'd be soooo unsatisfied with them"". 

i'm not really confrontational, i just shrugged off her comments and told her more than once they're not funny. yesterday it was more, to my liking, a direct insult. i was just minding my own god damned business doing some work when she asked me:

her: hey op, would you use shoes if you had no legs?
me: well, depends if i had prosthetics or not. 
her: but would you if you had no prosthetics? 
me: i don't think so, why? 
her: then why do you wear a bra? hahaha they are so small. 

i was tired at the moment. i admit i snapped, i told her ""at least my breasts aren't saggy like a pair of rotten melons."" 

she got angry. like i just wished death upon her mother; father, and firstborn. she started crying and saying i'm an asshole for picking on such a sensitive subject for her ????? 

my boyfriend thinks i was not an asshole and technically i wasn't talking about her tits so that's shit she took upon herself. some of our mutual female friends told me i should apologize, her boyfriend told me that's a sensitive subject for her and i should apologize. she sent me a text that she will be mad at me until i properly apologize to her. 

i don't want to apologize as i think i was not the asshole here. play bitch games win bitch prizes, or as we'd say in my language, this woman ""se lleva y no se aguanta"".

i took advise from here too and told her to stop making comments about my breasts or i'd have to go to hr. you know, culturally (in my country) it's not that of an offense for women to speak about other women's breasts. she told me i was a crybaby and a weakass softie.

"for telling my boss his ""time theft"" concerns are not my problem?. the computers at my job are fairly crappy and require several minutes to boot. after turning them on i have to wait a couple of minutes for them to get to the password screen, then a few more minutes before they're all loaded up and ready to go. typically i come in, turn them on, check my phone messages, hit the head (long commute to work) then get going. it's around 5 minutes max. 

&#x200b;

so this morning he calls a meeting and announces that going forward he wants everyone there 10 minutes before their required start time in order to boot their machines and starts citing how much this so-called ""time theft"" is costing him and etc. i replied that if he wants me to come in at 8:50 instead of 9 that's fine, but the ten minutes has to come off the end of the day unless he's going to pay the 50 minutes of ot a week. i also pointed out that when he opens the building at 8am he could spend two minutes turning on everyone's (three people) computers, which would cut the wait time in half at least. then i said that my time is as valuable to me as his is to him and even though it's ""just ten minutes"" they're my ten minutes, not his and i'm not interested in donating my time for nothing. 

&#x200b;

"for not sharing my prize with a mentally handicapped person in a contest?. every summer my community has a cookoff competition. usually about 20-30 individuals or couples try to cook xyz and then they can win a portion of the entry ticket fees while the rest go into the community parks. it's not summer yet but they decided to do it early. this year it was pasta sauce. i've been going to these for years, ever since my wife and i moved here but this is the first time i entered as a competitor. it was earlier today.

one of the other competitors, i know her somewhat (only in passing) is a 15 or 16 year old with asperger's syndrome and autism. i don't know much about this condition evidently. i'll call her jessica. i guess a lot of people got wind of her being a part of the competition that we had news crews here taping her to put on the news. we've never had this before as far as i know.

to make the story short, i won the competition. and $1,500. there's no second or third place prize, it's winner takes all. my wife and i were in shock because i like to think of myself as a decent home cook and take pride in my pasta sauce specifically, but to win a contest? we were tickled pink. 

we celebrated for about twenty minutes when the event organizers came to us. you might be able to guess where this is going, but they asked if we'd give our prize to jessica as a ""gesture of good will"". they said they'd get some publicity since news reporters are here. we obviously said no, $1,500 is a lot of money. so they then asked if we'd like to split it, 50/50, with jessica. likewise we said no.

i guess some nearby patrons overheard the conversation and chimed in. apparently we're assholes and jerks for not sharing the prize at least. after a few moments, there might have been 10 other people all clamoring to us about how we're a disgrace to the community, etc.

"for not telling my sister about my nephew's new ""boyfriend""?. last year i took in my nephew, who is now almost 17, after my sister and her husband kicked him out because of his sexuality. i'm a single parent of two kids of my own, 15 year old girl and 12 year old boy, and we live in another state so it was a big transition for everyone but i felt it was important. i should also note that i left the church of latter day saints (mormon) 8 years ago and moved out of utah. it's part of the reason i am divorced. 

anyway, last night i took the kids out to a local carnival and my nephew ran into his ""boyfriend"" there. i put boyfriend in quotes because they aren't really dating. in my family they would refer to it as ""crushing on each other"" instead. the ""boyfriend"" joined our group and my nephew took a picture of him with my two kids and posted it on social media saying ""nothing better than hanging out with the people i love."" i thought it was innocent enough. he never said they were dating and you can love your friends, but another one of my nieces saw it and reported it to my nephew's mom (my sister).

my sister is furious. she said that she should have been notified that he was dating. when i told her that they aren't even dating she said that she should have been told they were interested in each other. here's the thing though. there is no expectation that kids need to tell their parents who they are crushing on and my sister never felt the need to know when she thought her son was straight. now that she knows he's gay i don't think the rules should change to where she has to know if he has a crush on his friends. 

i also told her that she doesn't really have a say anymore. i have legal guardianship over my nephew. he's living in my home. she kicked him out. she started crying after i said this and told my family so i've been answering phone calls all morning hearing about how awful of a person i am for saying that to my sister. i don't see it but maybe i'm wrong. should i have told her even though they aren't serious? was it a low blow to say the things i said to her? am i the asshole?

edit: thanks everyone. i feel like an asshole now for asking this question. it probably seems obvious to many people but this is all brand new to me. walking away from the church and my ex husband was the hardest thing i ever had to do and i think i still carry a lot of guilt from that. my kids don't get to see a lot of my family or their dad's family because we aren't welcome for walking away. to have my whole family pissed at me again really hurt. i don't know anything about raising a 17 year old in general and am only now getting caught up on what it means to have a gay child so it's a learning process.

edit2: i completely understand why people think this is a validation post and don't blame the mods if they have to delete this. i want to be super clear that wasn't what i intended to do. when you grow up in the environment i did it's hard to feel confident in any decision you make. everything i did from the time i started talking to leaving my husband and the church has been questioned. going against my family automatically makes me feel like i am messing up. when i picked a college they didn't want me to go to and refused to acknowledge or pay for, my first thought was that i messed up. when i divorced my husband and left utah and my family stopped speaking to me, i thought i messed up. it has taken years to overcome what i have been taught and i am not a confident person. i let my 12 year old join the football team this year and can't stop questioning that. every decision i make is harder for me than it is for most people. i am sorry if anyone feels like i am being anything other than genuine.",3
"for not helping to pay for my sister's college, even though i could easily afford to?. i'm 29, my sister is 27.

we're polar opposites. i've always worked hard and taken risks to succeed. my sister has always slacked off and never put any real effort in to succeed. she tried attending college but spent all her free time partying/smoking pot/sleeping around and ended up failing half her courses in her first year and dropped out. 

recently she decided she wants to go back to university to become a nurse. she currently works as a cashier at a supermarket so it would be a big step up career wise. problem is my parents have lost most of their savings due to some very poor choices and can't afford to support her while she studies and help pay her tuition.

on the other hand, i'm currently working as an actuary and have plenty of disposable income. naturally, my parents think i should support her and pay her tuition while she studies. they say she'll continue working part time and will pay what she can, but i'm basically expected to support her and pay her tuition, or let her stay at my house so she doesn't have to pay rent.

i shut down the idea immediately. in my opinion, her current situation is entirely her own fault for not working hard when she was younger. my gf and i plan on getting married soon and i don't want to waste money on my sister's education.

as you can imagine i'm now seen as the greedy brother who won't help out family... even though my sister has never done anything to help me.

so yeah, am i really the asshole here?",3
"for breaking up with my girlfriend over ""consent required""?. before any of you start freaking out at me, i want to say that i fully support both women and men asking for consent before getting touchy or sexual with another person, and i would never in my life think about treating another person that way. now that thats out of the way, the moment.  

i've been with my girlfriend for the last 8\~ months.  in this time, we've slept together, been sexual together, and all that jazz.  we've hit a comfortable routine where on friday nights one of us would go to the others place and spend the weekend there.  our usual routine on the first night is watching some shitty movie or tv show until we realize we don't actually care what we're watching and would much rather make out.  this goes on until one of us decides to start pawing at each others genitals like a cat pawing the bottom of the door while you're trying to use the bathroom.  things lead into foreplay followed by the usual sex times.   this has been our almost weekly routine for a good 3 months now.  we've been comfortable with each other and very open about our sexual desires and what not.

now, on this last friday, i went over to her apartment.  we put on some stupid netflix documentary that i can't remember the name of, and about half way through we started tongue boxing.  i got into it, and decided to start touching her, resulting in me getting under her pants.  i do the business and make her feel good.  after this, we just sit there for a minute in the after glow, before she pulls away from me and goes kind of silent.  i try to talk to her because i can tell somethings suddenly upset her but have no idea what, she tries to tell me that nothings wrong.  i tell her that i know when shes upset and if she's not willing to talk with me about it then i should probably just go, so she breaks down and says this.

""i just feel like you kind of use me.  you never ask for my consent before touching me and it makes me feel like an object instead of a person.""

now, of course i understand the sentiment.  i'm not always the most romantic of person, i try to make her feel good and give 110% to her, but i can see where shes coming from.  still, i was \visibly confused\ at this statement, and she must have noticed because she huffed and pulled away again and said that i never listen to her.

i point out how we've been dating for months, and that neither of us has asked for consent to touch the other since we first started dating and were just starting to be sexual towards one another.  she gets mad at this and says how it isn't the same for a woman as it is a man.  i tell her how blatantly a double standard that is.  

at this point shes getting angry and borderline yelling at me about this, and says that i'm no longer allowed to touch her in any way unless i ask first and she gives me permission.

i say that it makes no sense for us to be dating and in a romantic relationship if she expects me to walk on eggshells just to try and be intimate with her, and say that shes making me feel like i'm some kind of molester or sexual offender because i want to touch the woman i've been dating for 8 months.

""well maybe you are!"" she says angrily.  at this point, i'm angry, annoyed, and absolutely fed up.  i just say that if thats the way things need to be with her then maybe we just should break up.  she throws a fit over this and starts insulting me, at which time i just leave and go home.

not five minutes after i walk in my door, shes texting me saying that shes sorry for insulting me and yelling at me, i think it over for a minute and decide that i'm done, text her back that we're through, and go to bed.

&#x200b;

i woke up in the morning to almost 50 texts, most from her either being apologetic or angry, the rest being from friends of hers or her sister calling me an asshole because i ""broke up with the perfect woman because i wasn't allowed to grope her whenever i want.""

so, am i the asshole here?  i feel like i'm justified in my reaction and opinions regarding this, but at the same time feel like maybe theres some new wave promoting the virtue of consent that i've missed?  am i the asshole for thinking that you shouldn't need to ask for consent to touch or feel your partner if you're in a romantic relationship?  

&#x200b;

and before you start yelling at me (even though i'm sure half of you have already started typing) i respect a persons right to say no.  if i touch my girlfriend, or any girl i'm with sexually/romantically for that matter, and they say they aren't interested or aren't in the mood, i'll stop, no question.  i just think requiring consent every time is insane and more damaging to the relationship than anything.

"for telling a 'homophobe' that i've seen his grindr account?. for the sake of convenience, i'll call homophobe 'j'.

j and i used to be friends in school, until i came out as gay and he began to distance himself from me and spread rumors. he then started saying it was gross/wrong etc.

years pass, and i'm scrolling through grindr when i spot a faceless torso picture, unmistakably his due to a set of freckles on his chest, the username being his first initial, and the distance from me matching where he lives. his profile states that is hookup only, with no face pictures given.

i think to myself ""oh, he came out, good for him."" then i look at his facebook. he's still spouting homophobia, sharing lgbt stories with his own opinions etc, and harrassing lgbt people that he comes across online.

so, to tell him if i found his profile and recognized him, many of the people he's insulted could easily find him as well?

edit: if i do tell him i've seen the account, it will be private through facebook or grindr. it isn't anybodies' place to publically out somebody that doesn't want to be out.",3
"for refusing to meet my half sister who was a result of my dads affair?. mom and pops were married for 30ish years. i'm 26. always thought they were a dream couple until 5 years ago when i found out that my dad had fathered a child from an affair that he had in 2006. 

my mom went batshit crazy when she found out, i honestly believe her mental health cracked and deteriorated from then and she divorced my dad and moved to the other side of the us. essentially, i lost my mom to my dads idiocy, she is *not* the same woman as she used to be. 

my dad had always been in this girls life, but over the past 5 years i guess because he had no one to keep it a secret from he's more or less a full time dad to her. 

since the divorce i've kept my distance from him, i'm just trying to secure my bag , live quietly and stay away from drama. 

he has lately started up this crusade of me meeting this girl and developing a brotherly bond with her. i told him it's just not on the cards, i have no interest in picking up a relationship with anybody and i have my own hatred for my fathers new family and idc what anyone says, therapy ain't fixing that. believe me, i've tried. it's better for my mental health if i continue to do my thing and not involve myself. 

it's got to a point where everyone on my paternal side is bugging me for some sort of christmas miracle meet up, apparently this girl wants to know me very much and is begging that she gets to meet me as a christmas present. i've consistently told everybody 'no' and i'm also not celebrating christmas with them in case they try force anything. 

the only person on my side in all this is my fiancee, who is the only one who gives a shit about what hurt this might cause me instead of anything else. just wondering if iata for shutting everybody down over this.",3
"for telling my husband i won't take my stepdaughter on holiday again?. i have two children from a previous relationship. danielle (11) and elliot (7). my husband john loves them as his own, but also has a fifteen year old daughter, alicia, from a previous relationship. we've been married four years, but i've only seen her a handful of times, firstly because she spends of her time with her mother, and also because she attends an elite boarding school for girls, so the opportunity to see her is very rare. 

over the summer me and the kids went on holiday to spain for three weeks. john was supposed to come but he was snowed under with work commitments. however, when he told alicia, she said she's always wanted to go there and she begged him to convince me to let her come, which i did, but her mum had to pay for her flight/place in the hotel. 

it all went well at first, but a problem started when it turned out alicia didn't pack anywhere near three weeks worth of clothing, meaning that initially she had to borrow some of mine - which were oversized - and then when we went shopping, i couldn't afford anywhere near the sort of clothing she likes, and she cried at having to make do with ''cheap'' stuff. she then phoned up her mum crying saying i was being unfair to her for making her wear clothes that she wasn't ''used to'' she also continuously tried to persuade me to buy her alcohol. 


we had another row when she met some boys from the same country as us in a restaurant/bar. she was cuddling with one of them, and when elliot was tired and we needed to go home, she tried to stay with them and go back to where they were staying. as her guardian on the trip i was not prepared to allow her to go home with a group of boys we'd never met in a foreign country. she threw a huge tantrum at me about this when we got home, saying what's the point in coming on holiday if i won't let her have fun. 

finally, alicia was sulking throughout the journey home, and took to trying to antagonise danielle, asking her if she's ready to have ''no friends'' once she starts secondary school, calling her ugly and things like that. i stopped this immediately and she sulked even more. 

when we got back i told john how difficult alicia had been throughout the trip and said that i wouldn't take her on a trip with me again. he insisted that none of what she did was that bad, but i insisted on speaking to alicia's mum on the phone and telling her everything her daughter had done. she defended her daughter completely and insisted that everything she did was ''what teenage girls do''. i was shocked, but after john and leanne (his ex) spoke over the phone he has been defending her too, insisting that she's really nice if i get to know her and things like that. 

i've not said that i'll never be in the same room as her again, i've just said that i won't take someone that badly behaved on holiday with me again, but john says that i'm overreacting, and that i should give her another chance, which i have no intention of doing.

update: thanks for all these responses they gave me a lot of food for thought. while i still stand by my decision and won't take alicia on holiday unless john is there with me, a lot of people said that i haven't taken enough time to actually get to know my stepdaughter which to be honest is true, but as said above there are reasons for this. even though she's a very smart kid (girls have to pass very difficult entry exams to go to that school even if their parents can afford it), i think there are better ways to bring out her potential than boarding school. it is of course leanne's decision but it isn't something i'd have chosen for her or any of my kids. as some of the comments here have suggested it is entirely possible feels unloved and also unwelcome in our household, which isn't true at all, which is why i told john that i will make the effort to get to know alicia properly, and actually suggested that we invite her here next time she's home from boarding, and hope to spend as much time with her as i can.",3
"for cutting my mother out of my life for letting me be homeless?. back in 2009 when the economy tanked i lost my job, my car, my apartment, my girlfriend. basically everything. at first i didn't want anyone to know what had happened so i stayed at a friends house for a week while i looked for a new job. but his landlord told me guests couldn't stay for more than 7 days at a time in a 30 day period. so i asked my mother if i could stay with her while i looked for a job. i told her i'd be on the street homeless if she didn't help me and she still decided to refuse to help me. fast forward 2 months, i've been sleeping on the streets for every night still unable to secure a job. even something like safeway or mcdonald's. my dad finds out that i'm homeless and sends me a ticket to come live with him in nj and i accept. within a week i have a job and in 3 months i'm in my own place again. it's been 10 years since then and i haven't spoken to my mother because of what i perceive to be a betrayal. she attempts to contact me frequently and i ignore it. for cutting her out of my life? 

tl;dr mother let me be homeless and i never forgive her.

edit: i have already cut ties. i haven't spoken to her in 10 years. it's my siblings telling me that i am the asshole that prompted this post.

edit: people keep asking for her reasoning and all i can say is what she said to me. she said she couldn't afford to let me stay. but all i was asking for was a place to sleep. not money, or food. i was getting a small unemployment check and eventually i got food stamps. i could have contributed. 

edit: i guess i also have to say that i never asked my parents for anything. i've earned everything i have. i am not a drug user and i have never been. i don't drink and i've been the most responsible of all the children. oh and my post should probably be she let me stay homeless instead of let me be homeless.",3
"for leaving an 18 cent tip and getting the waitress fired?. i was dining at an upscale restaurant and the bill came out to $49.82. i pulled out a $50 to pay, and told the waitress i didn't need change. goes without saying, but i was planning on leaving the rest of her tip on the table. i used to work as a server. i always tip generously. 

the waitress misunderstood my intentions and said ""really?"" loud enough for all the other diners to hear. before i could say anything, she said something like ""woooow- thanks for the generous tip"", snatched the payment from the table, and walked away in a huff. all the diners around me were staring daggers at me. it was humiliating. 

i flagged down the manager and let him know what happened. he knows me and knows i'd never stiff servers. 

he offered to comp the meal, but i said it wasn't necessary. i just wanted to let him know what happened and would be on my way. the manager insisted that i was owed an apology. made sense to me at the time. she apologizes, gets her tip, i leave, everyone is happy. 

when the manager called the waitress over, both of us saw her roll her eyes as she was walking here. as soon as the manager saw this, he put on his ""you're about to get fired"" face. all the tears and pleading made no difference. it was ugly. people were filming with their cell phones. 

as she was being escorted to the back by some kitchen workers (who probably think i'm the second coming of satan). the manager insisted on comping our meal and we went on our way. 

when we got home, the wife claimed i was an asshole for making a huge scene out of nothing, and getting that poor girl fired over a simple misunderstanding. i feel like all i did was share a legitimate complaint to the manager. she is the one who escalated it by rolling her eyes at us. am i being unreasonable? what would you have done in this situation?

"for asking my sister to be discreet about her polyamorous (male-female-female) relationship in front of the kids?. i guess it should be are ""we"" the assholes, but idk if that's an accepted acronym here. 

apologies that the line up is a bit complicated but i'll try to lay it out as best i can. 

my family is going on a group vacation this summer. we are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. my husband and i are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization. 

it will be me, my husband and our two kids, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (kids' ages range from 3 to 9). in addition, my sister, her husband and their girlfriend are invited.

we initially only invited my sister and her husband,  but my sister insisted that their girlfriend (who i think they've been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well. 

my sister is in a polyamorous relationship and, although my family and i don't get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. so as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone  please refrain from any pda in front of the kids. we were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. 
my sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances. 

at this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. i'm conflicted though. she's my sister and i obviously love her. but i also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation.

"if i decline my twin stepdaughter's request to adopt her?. wife and i got married as widowers. my late wife and daughter passed away in an accident. my daughter was only 1 when she passed away. my current wife had 3 yo twins when we got married. the girls are 15 now.

so, yesterday when wife and i were watching a movie, she told me that the girls were planning a surprise for me on their birthday. and when i asked her what it was, she told me that they wanted me to adopt them. i was really happy, because it meant that i had done a good job, but unfortunately i cannot adopt them. i'm actually glad that my wife told me that. a surprise would have caught me off guard. 

the thing is, my wife and i had discussed about this when they were young. i made it clear that i didn't want to adopt anyone or have more children. call it coping up with my daughter's death or whatever, but i've never felt comfortable thinking about it. my wife is now asking me to say yes.

"for insulting a customer at my dad's restaurant for making unsolicited suggestions about my hair?. i (f 22) work part time at my father's restaurant/deli as a cashier while i'm in school. i'm mixed, so my natural hair is very thick and curly textured and since i stopped keeping it in a protective style, i like to where it out in a semi afro. one day, a frequent customer (an old man, probably around 70) says, ""you are such a pretty girl, you shouldn't wear your hair like that. you'd look much better if you went to a salon and gotten it straightened out"". 
i said back to him ""maybe you should have some hair before you comment about mine"". he's old, so he's a bit bald. he called me rude and nasty, then flagged down my dad about it. i got in trouble but i refused to apologize. my dad has also commented on my hair before. i told the customer, ""i'm not trying to make it about race but my dad is an older white guy as well, and i'm not white. my hair will never be straight unless i flat iron it"". but i'm not apologizing and i don't feel bad about saying what i said.",3
"for wanting my step dad to replace my laptop with a new £2000 one?. throwaway because i have to use my brother's laptop after the incident.

i (18f) have just started university and after two years of saving up, i splurged on a £2000 ($2600) hp spectre with the highest specs. i treasured the laptop, it was my baby. i used it for all of my uni work, gaming, watching shows, everything really.

now, my step dad is a horrible person. he's always complaining about what i spend my money on and spent all of my time working trying to get me to quit so i wouldn't be able to spend so much money. he's always had it in for my laptop and my phone that i paid a lot for.

i should also mention that i don't live with him, so what i spend my money on makes no difference to him.

anyway, i've just come home for easter break and my step dad has destroyed my laptop. i don't know how this happened exactly, but he sat on it, put it on the floor when he realised, and then stood on it when he got up. i could tell by the smug look on his face that he meant to do it and he wasn't remorseful in the slightest. when my mum was out of the room, he's made it clear i deserved it and hasn't stopped joking about it. he's also 'jokingly' said my phone is next.

my mum has forced him to apologise and she also made him agree to buy me a new one, as hes literally destroyed this one beyond repair. i'm already super upset about losing my games (but thankfully my work was backed up).

however, he's saying he can't afford to replace the laptop over £500. i understand that £2000 is a lot of money, but he broke it on purpose, and i spent so long saving. i've made it clear that if he doesn't replace it with the same specs and nothing less i will be either pawning his television, watch, old laptops, whatever or going to the police. my whole family thinks this is awful of me as this would be extremely hard for my family.

so, i know i'm not the asshole for the broken laptop. but am i for accepting nothing less as a replacement?

"for getting a single mother fired even though she was nice to me?. for context, i am really into body building and have been going to the gym 3-4 times a week since i was 13 (now 29).

there is a personal trainer, ashley, at my current gym thats also a single mother of two. i mention this as it's the reason i think i'm probably an asshole since she clearly needs the job to support her kids.

anyway, i'm not really friends with her, but she's always really nice to me and has flirted with me a lot previously. we talk occasionally. yesterday she asked if i wanted to add her on social media and i figured why not, so i said yes.

later in my workout i started looking through her posts out of boredom when i saw a picture of a morbidly obese person along with a caption making fun of them trying to run. the picture was clearly taken at the gym.

this really angered me because they're trying to improve their health, and the last thing they need is some attractive young girl talking shit about them, even if it's not to their face. i scrolled through a few more posts and sure enough this is a regular thing. she discreetly takes pictures of fat people to make fun of when they're working out.

really really pissed me off to see these people being made fun of for trying to fix their life. without thinking i just went straight to the owners office (we know each other well) to show him. ashley was fried immediately.

"for throwing away my dishes rather than wash them, even if my roommate can't afford to replace them?. i'm 28f, my roommate is 29f and is a single mother to an 8 month old.

we both contribute to rent equally, but basically all of the kitchenware is mine. i had it all before she moved in and we agreed before she moved in that we'd share them because she only gets so much money a month and it would be impossible to get her own kitchen stuff. it's no big deal to me, but at the time, her child was exclusively bottle fed.

now her kid eats rice cereal or oat cereal. i don't know how many people here are parents or whatever but this is the most vile stuff to smell. she mixes this porridge like sludge half and half with formula. it begins to smell immediately and after an hour? i've thrown up before from the smell. but whatever, kids gotta eat.

my problem is my roommate doesn't wash these dishes. she'll make this oatmeal stuff, feed it to her kid, then leave half of it remaining in the bowl in the sink, oftentimes when i'm at work. after 2-3 hours, it turns into cement basically, and our dishwasher won't clean it. i always have to clean it because she's busy with her kid. try as i might to get her to *just rinse it after use* so it can be put in the dishwasher, it falls on deaf ears. i even asked if she'd get tiny plastic bowls to make it and she said she can't afford it (a 5-pack is only like $5 and are dishwasher safe)...

after about a month of this, i've begun just throwing them out. instead of cleaning them, i throw my dishes away. we have no bowls now, she can't prepare this stuff in a plate. she's started using my cups to make it and i'll be throwing those away, too. it is nothing to me to replace these things and when i do, i'll be keeping them hidden.

"for evicting my son for moving in his girlfriend?. i own several properties and rent them out. my son is 20 and goes to school near one of the properties (10-unit luxury apartment). it's cheaper to let him live there rent-free than living in the dorms. obviously the condo is much larger (three bedrooms, 2 bath, gym on-site) private, quieter, etc. i put several conditions on his living there rent-free. nothing shocking; no smoking (he doesn't), no parties, keep the place clean, turn off the lights when you leave and no moving people in. a couple of months ago, i noticed that the utilities at the condo skyrocketed because he moved in his girlfriend. his girlfriend was having issues with her roommates. to add insult to injury, this girl moved in her friend who came out to la to be an actress and had no where to go. i told my son i didn't give a fuck what problems these girls were having - no roommates or he can move out. he lied to me about their moving out. i told him again - no roommates - or leave. he started playing with semantics how they're not really moved in and just spends a night or two. i don't give a fuck. i could be charging 4k a month for the condo (this is westwood, ca) and by letting them stay there, it puts me at risk of their claiming tenant rights. that could cost me tens of thousands of dollars in lost rent and legal fees. and if that's not bad enough, his girlfriend talks about the condo as if it's ""their"" condo.

rather than fight with him, again, i asked my property manager to begin the eviction process on my son. i treat him no differently than people who don't pay their rent. i told my son i ain't paying for his boarding at school and his ass is going to pay rent if he moves back home. the commute from my house to ucla is a bitch. he's not 12. i don't owe him anything. he should be kissing my ring for paying for tuition and keeping him on my insurance plan.

&#x200b;

and, no, i am not officially renting out the place to either of them. they don't have money, the credit or respect to qualify to rent one of my properties out.",3
"update: for being upset that my son didn't tell me he is gay?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c2oyc4/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_son_didnt_tell_me_he/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

i have been doing a lot of reflection on my actions over the past months since my post, including taking into account all of the advice i was getting from my last post.

i have decided to get therapy (which i probably should have done a long time ago i acknowledge) and work on my issues so i can start to be the father to jack that he deserves but never had.

i reached out to him a few days ago to express this to him and he said that while he appreciates that i'm trying, it's going to take him a long time to get over all the bullshit i put him through but that he is willing to try. 

he is honestly such an amazing kid and even though his mom and i don't get along at all, i will say she did good in raising him. 

we have a plan to talk every other day on the phone along with some in person visits and if he feels up to it, i would like to invite him and his boyfriend out for dinner sometime.

i know i have a lot of work to do but i'm trying to be a better man. that includes staying sober. maybe even my two sons could be friends one day. 

i just wanted to update and say thanks.",3
"update for following my 42m wife 27f around for an evening?. here is a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bxpblv/aita\_for\_following\_my\_42m\_wife\_27f\_around\_for\_an/(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bxpblv/aita_for_following_my_42m_wife_27f_around_for_an/).

if you don't want to read it, here's the summary...i believed my wife to be having an affair with a coworker who had repeatedly appeared in her pictures and conversations. so, one happy hour, i followed her. even though i had seen nothing definitive, i confronted her about the issue, and she threatened to end things with me.

believe it or not, i listened to your advice. i received extensive advice from both sides. publicly, everyone agreed i was at fault. in my direct messages, many fervently believed me to be in the right. regardless, i sat down and talked to my wife about my insecurities concerning her coworker, brandon. i told her i did not feel as attractive as brandon and worried that as i was getting older, her interest in me was waning. i also asked her if she felt financially stable in the relationship. i apologized for following her and told her i would never do it again.

she told me several things. first, that she was offended i did not trust her. second, that she did suspect brandon had feelings for her based on some of his interactions and comments. third, that she sometimes felt isolated by my work and never felt motivated one way or the other by my income. the thing about programming is it is hard to explain my work to someone who does not program.

she also told me my physical appearance and aging had no impact on her feelings towards me. she reaffirmed that she loved me and would never throw away our marriage for a divorced coworker.

so, what of our future? i asked her if she still wanted to be with me or if she could not see a future with me after i had followed her. she joked that she would forgive me after drinking a few cocktails at a tropical resort. she told me that in addition to the stalking, the cocktails would also help her forget about all of my past rants about various programming languages (java, specifically). i haven't told her yet, but i plan to surprise her with an all inclusive package to the maldives, or some other island young women enjoy that i never heard of until researching...

tl;dr - my wife and i are back on track. thank you, genuinely.

thank you to the kind user who helped me figure out how to create this update post.",3
"aita: for shaming people who blast music in public?. i hate when people blare music in public, even if it's music i like. i really don't understand why idiots have to loudly play music in front of everyone. i see these people almost daily on my commute on mass transit and it's been annoying the hell outta me. it's one thing to be listening to loud music in your earbuds, it's another blaring fetty wap from a portable speaker on a bus. 


lately, i've been making a point to carry around a couple crappy earbuds. whenever i hear someone blasting music phones/portable boom box i loudly say ""it must suck to not even afford earbuds, here have a pair on me."" and offer them the crappy earbuds.  my so thinks i'm a cunt for doing this.",3
"for telling one of my bridesmaids to take her glasses off during photos?. i am getting married in a few weeks and have my bridal party primed and ready, but had a huge disagreement with one of them yesterday. 

her name is tara, and she is stunning. she's legit the prettiest out of our entire group. absolutely gorgeous. however, there is one issue. tara has terrible vision. she needs very strong glasses and even with them on her eyesight is bad. she gets the lenses thinned down as much as possible and even then they are so thick you can't see her eyes behind them. her eyes can't tolerate contacts.

in our ''bridal meeting'' yesterday, i asked if it was possible for tara to take off her glasses during the main photos. i wasn't saying this to be cruel. i'd never ask her to take them off during the wedding party and walk around blind, but i'm just asking her to take them off during photos. without those glasses she's absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, way more than me, but with them on her eyes look weird and distorted and would take all the attention away in the photos for all the wrong reasons.

i brought this up with her but she got really huffy and sulky, told me to try on her glasses so i could see what she would be seeing during the photos if she took them off. i did and it was horrible, but i could stomach it for a few minutes to help out a friend and think she's being really unreasonable. she left early and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''. i don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. i'm doing her a favour. without the glasses she'll easily be the hottest bridesmaid so i would have thought she'd be ok with it.",3
"if i (37f) tell my husband (38m) that he can follow the event dress code or just stay home?. my side of the family is very close and ~~my~~ our niece (call her n) is getting married in a few months. the ceremony is halfway across the country and i've been saving for several months so our family of 5 can fly out for it. the venue is upscale and beautiful.

the ceremony will be a formal-ish event (she said it fits most closely with the ""cocktail"" definition here(https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet)). 

husband doesn't *dress up*. he wore a tux for his best friend's wedding when he was 20 and that's the last time he's worn a tie. he wore jeans and a casual sport coat for our wedding (that was fine with me - it was his wedding too and the ceremony was immediate family only).

when i broke the news about n's wedding, adding that we'd rent a suit instead of making an otherwise useless purchase, he said ""no. i'm not wearing a suit. i guess i'll be the only one there not in a suit.""

i told him that if he won't wear the appropriate attire then he can just stay home and everyone will know that he's a whiny butt baby who thinks his personal preference is more important than a special family event for someone he says he loves. i added ""nice priorities there, honey.""

* my mom and brother (n's dad) said yta - just ask n if she cares, but they're sure she won't.
* n's mom says i'm nta, but my delivery could have been better (i disagree - it was perfect for my husband).
* i don't have very many friends to ask, and i'm not asking n. weddings are stressful enough without worrying about inconsiderate guest questions.

what do you think?

edit: this got bigger than anticipated. and my very first silver and gold! thank you all! i don't know how i'll get through all your responses, but i'll do my best.

i really don't care that he's jeans, t-shirts and boots. we live in small town in the midwest. preachers and undertakers wear suits here.

i just need him to not be so inflexible on something so stupid. you'd think i was asking him to kick puppies or cannibalize small children.

last edit: i shouldn't have posted his uncensored pic. i removed the link, but we all know the internet lives forever. so i'll fess up about this entire post, but won't be bitchy about it.",3
"for being upset about a ""prank"" my girlfriend pulled on me?. this past friday, my girlfriend and i had a small get together at our apartment where i proceeded to get very drunk. i'm not a very experienced drinker. my girlfriend put me to bed early in the night. the next morning, i wake up very hungover and thirsty. i see that there is a water bottle on my night stand with a sticky note that says ""water"" on it. i thought this was weird at the time, because what else would it be? very thankful that i didn't have to get up to get water, i proceed to chug the ""water"" only to quickly realize that it was actually vodka and then vomit all over our bed. at that point, my girlfriend woke up and was very angry at me. 

i felt very bad, i didn't realize at the time that my girlfriend had left the bottle there, so i got up and cleaned everything up even though i felt like dog shit. she denied putting the ""water"" there so i just thought one of our friends did it. it was a shitty thing to do, but i got over it until later that day one of the people there that night tagged me in an instagram video of my girlfriend basically setting up the prank. it shows her pouring vodka into a water bottle and saying how funny it's going to be while her friend filming it is telling her she's being a dick and she just laughs and says ""hair of the dog"" then howls.

i confronted my girlfriend about this and she thinks the video is hilarious and sees no problem with it. i told her if she really didn't remember doing this, then she has a drinking problem. it was a very cruel thing to do. she said i was overreacting and being sensitive.

edit: i really don't think she lied. i think she probably did it in a blackout.",3
"for my sister and her bf breaking up?. sister, teri
sisters bf, tom

so i'm most likely the asshole but here we go. 

so my sister started dating this guy 2 years ago, everything was fine until last week. 

now a few dates in tom tells her that he is a father to a boy and a girl and that he has custody of them every 3d weekend and whenever he wants during the holidays. 
teri was ok with this surprisingly as she is subbed to heaps of child free pages. 

last week i found out that they wanted to move in together, he was looking for 2 bed places so the kids have a room.
i thought that she would be fine with this, turns out she is not. 

she complained to me a few days back that she hated that the kids had to tag along and that she hopes he looses custody of them so they can have more one on one time. i asked her if she was joking and she replied. no why would i want fucking crotch goblins living with me. i then repeated so it's a joke right? and she said no. 
so i asked her why she is moving in with someone who has kids, and her response was, he is hot. 

i told her that she should break up with him if she hates the kids so much as they are a package deal and she got mad at me and left. 

i then got a message where she sent me a photo of some weed and the caption, custody no more. (he has monthly drug tests)

i automatically called him and let him know and provided proof with the photo. 

tori is now a single woman and is fucking pissed at me, my mum has also taken her side and now i'm regretting it.

"for spending my sons lottery winnings money?. i have a wife (wilhelma, 40) and two sons (sam, 17, and scott, 16).  6 years ago, i ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) i decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  it was a blast.  we all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  i mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  but i specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  well wouldn't you know it, sams ticket won.  of course its actually my ticket, and i had to claim it.  it didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  i sat them both down and explained that i was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  they absolutely wanted a gaming system, and wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  we all agreed on this, and saving the rest.

&#x200b;

i bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a disney world trip.  the boys don't even like disney, but it was always wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  another $5k.  last year, sam wanted a car.  wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so i agreed and spent ""his"" $4k on a car.  i pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving scott to his stuff as well.  wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.  

&#x200b;

since day 1, i've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  i've always spent my own money on all this stuff.  i have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  wilhelma knows i have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  she knows i was investing the lottery winnings as well.  i've always told her about the money doing well, but i guess i never explicitly said how well.  she also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.  

&#x200b;

sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  while looking at the portfolio, wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  i told her i invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  she then asked why we're only giving sam $30k when it should be $50k.  i said no, the other $40k is mine.  i managed this account, i made the investments, i did all of the work.  plus i paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. the $40k stays and i'll keep investing it.  if the boys need the money, its there, but if not i'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  she thinks i'm stealing ""his"" money since i wouldn't have been able to invest with it if i didn't have it to begin with.  i say its always kinda been my money, and i'm still giving him the $30k i promised him since the beginning.",3
"for having sex with my sister in law on the wedding night.. hey reddit,

i was best man for my brothers wedding, the maid of honor was his brides sister.  i am 24m while the sister (katie) was 20f.  we really hit it off right away.  we study the same subject in school, shes witty and funny and we got along really well.

day of the wedding my brother and dad pull me aside and give me strict orders not to talk or initiate anything with katie.  i said that would be hard as we literally walk up the aisle together.  he said that was fine but other than that no contact, he then turned to me and said ""this is my day, i can tell you like her by the way you guys, stop being so selfish bro and be a good brother for once in your life"" this shocked me as we had a good relationship but i get he was stressed.

wedding was going well and i obeyed them for the first part of the day, she wanted to dance but i said no.  she looked hurt and confronted me when i was getting a drink.  she said ""we were having so much fun before the day of the wedding, what changed?  i really like you and want to get to know you better, do you feel the same way""?  i said yes, and apologized and we danced.  

my dad forcibly tried to pull me off the dancefloor but i ignored him,  i got a text from my brother during the party that i was not to talk to her.  i replied dude wtf i get its your day but whats the deal?  we ended up making out after my brother left with his bride to the hotel.  we went back to the hotel holding hands, and laughing and we finally kissed.  well we had sex in my room and i got her number and we are going to have a real first date this week.

i got a text from my brother later that day that his new wife told him what happened and he was extremely angry and couldn't believe i was so selfish.   my dad threw a fit when he found out and said he won't pay for my wedding when it happened.  i told him idc because i have a good job now.  i feel bad tho, did i ruin the day for my brother aita?",3

(so cliche!). i thought her speech was really selfish. i think it's super inappropriate to bring up a mental illness during a wedding speech. not only that, but the entire speech was about her. at my wedding. 90% of the guests congratulated her afterwards and talked about how ""strong"" she was. nobody was paying attention to me, at my own wedding! sorry if i sound selfish, but imo there is a time and a place for this sort of thing. so after the guests all greeted her, i asked her to leave and told her she was being disruptive and selfish. she was really upset but just left without arguing. my parents agree with me. but my husband and all of my close friends think i was way too harsh. aita?",3

i get a text from my mum to tell me to get to her place at 5 (this was 2 days ago) and so i got ready and headed off. i get to the house and noticed that the lights where all off but walked in anyways. all i hear is surprise and around 20/30 people leap out to surprise me. 
when i looked around the room i noticed that most of the people who where there where not my friends but my mums friends, like people from her church and job. 

i looked quite shocked and pulled mum to the side and told her how much i did not want this and asked her why her colleagues and friends were at my birthday party, she claimed that she wanted more people to surprise me. so i asked if we were going to head to the restaurant and she told me that we would be having a bbq here.

"update: if i told my daughter to find a different hobby. belated update to a post that was largely considered trolling, but wasn't. 

i won't lie when i say that i immediately ignored the majority of you telling me i was the asshole. or maybe ignore is the wrong word. i think i expected that from the get go, so being told i ""peaked in high school"" and ""should get fucked along with all the plastic cheerleader wannabe sahms"" rolled off my back. but, there were a few of you that did make me think long and hard about my relationship with my daughter and what sort of model (haha) i was setting for her. there was one comment in particular that's been sort of lost to the flood (if you can find it, i'd surely appreciate that) that mentioned my writing and how well it read, almost like a book.

maybe it's self absorbed, but that's really what made me stop for a moment. i've had to sacrifice a lot to get my family where they are today. i won't get into details because i'm sure it would be boring and pretentious and might make you all feel that i'm just trying to garner sympathy after being such a bitch, but it did involve giving up my dreams in order to make sure there was food on the table. i gave myself some time and space to think and realized the problem stemmed from me, not her. (surprise) i was bitter that everyone else seemed free to chase their passions when i had to work at things i hated for the things we needed. it seemed childish to me to be so selfish as to enjoy your free time when you could be making an effort for your family instead. that's neither here nor there but it definitely wasn't my daughter's fault that i was so resentful. 

i like to think she was relatively unaware of my concerns with her hobbies (i never voiced my opinion one way or another and always drove her to michaels) but i can say with certainty that our relationship has only improved in the last few months. i helped her build a miniature restaurant last saturday and i've got a fun little carnival on my nightstand as i type this. i can't regain the time i've lost, but i can make sure she doesn't have to live the life i'm currently living.

"for flipping out on my boyfriend for eating my cake?. my birthday was this past monday, and my parents got me a cake for it, naturally. i'm originally from michigan but go to school in texas, and as a surprise my parents mailed me something called a 'bumpy cake'. they were like my favorite thing when i was little and i'm not sure if they're only available in michigan but i definitely can't get them in texas. 

my boyfriend and i each had a slice of the cake, and then put it in the fridge. when i got back from work the next day i was super excited to eat more of it, only to find that not only was pretty much all of it gone, but it was butchered in a way that suggested it had just been eaten out of the box with a fork. 

i went into the bedroom where my boyfriend was and showed him the cake box. he laughed and said something along the lines of ""i couldn't help it!"" i called him a selfish asshole and told him i couldn't believe he felt so entitled to something that didn't belong to him. 

he seemed really shocked and upset and said he didn't think it would be such a big deal. he started apologizing profusely and said he'd get me another cake but i was so upset with him i just left. i came back a little while later and he had gone from sympathetic to angry. he said he couldn't believe i was so mad at him over a ""stupid fucking cake"" and he ended up storming out. 

i realize it seems stupid and i might have overreacted, but i still think it was completely out of line for him to do that. i've told some friends about the situation and they similarly thought i was being ridiculous and that i shouldn't have been so mad over cake. 

am i the asshole?

update: i've gotten a few messages asking for an update, so i figured i'd post one here. i haven't been able to read every comment, but i've looked at responses from every viewpoint and have taken everything to heart. a lot of you seem to think i'm just really stingy with my cake, but what i articulated to my boyfriend this morning was that i moreso was extremely upset that he felt entitled to what was essentially my birthday present. 

when he came back he had cooled down a lot, and we talked about everything. he apologized for eating all of the cake, and i apologized for losing my temper about it. when we argue we both have a habit of leaving instead of letting the argument escalate. i'm still not sure if this is the right move or not.

"for telling an anorexic girl to ""stay the fuck away from my girlfriend"". i've been dating my girlfriend for almost three years now (m18) (f17). since she's considered a minor medically she was put into a youth anorexia program for her eating disorder. shes been doing really well, improving a ton and making much faster progress than anyone there, (she knows and wants to get better but is still really mentally fragile). a girl was admitted last week for severe eating disorder, i'm taking fights nurses, refuses to eat and threatens to harm herself if they make her eat. my girlfriend told me that the girls been anorexic since she was 9, she's 17 now and has made zero progress according to her parents (she overheard, they share a room).

a few days ago my girlfriend mentioned that she's been trying to make friends with the new girl but she makes her severely uncomfortable. basically telling her that she looks perfect the way she was and that gaining weight was going to make her unattractive to me. shes also been telling her things like ""why do you want to get better, you look so healthy"" and ""wow your boyfriend must have loved your body, it's a shame"".

i eventually mentioned to a nurse that my girlfriend should be moved out of that environment asap and was moved to a different room yesterday. a few hours ago i went to visit and the girl basically confronted me and told me that i was an asshole for taking away her friend. 

things eventually escalated and i left off yelling at her to stay the fuck away from my girlfriend. 

am i in the wrong? i don't know how anorexia effects people mentally and am not sure if she even realized what she was doing was wrong.

"for telling my wife we are making our daughter, not her?. okay, so my wife and i are expecting our first child. she is 7 months along and we got an ultrasound yesterday to check on the progress (my wife's medical issues caused the obgyn to be extra cautious). 

during the appointment, the tech was pointing out our daughter's different body parts, telling us where the legs and feet are. it was the first time we didn't really need the help, because we could see our baby looking like a real baby. my wife started crying, and i was comforting her, when she said the words. ""i can't believe i'm making a human being.""

i kept comforting her, but i waited a few minutes and, once the tech was gone, gently reminded her that we are both the parents, not just her. i also told her that saying she's ""making"" the baby on her own is not accurate, since i provided half the genetic material. 

my wife was still emotional at this point, and she started crying again thinking i don't appreciate what she's putting her body through to be pregnant. obviously this is false, especially since her pregnancy has been so tough that i've attended at least two doctors appointments every month. i show her with actions, not words, that i appreciate her. 

i just don't think it's fair to claim i haven't contributed something to making our daughter. she is still upset the next day. so, aita?

"for telling the cashier to fuck off and subsequently demanding her to get her manager because she had a condescending attitude towards me buying condoms?. i'm really, really pissed off at this girl i just encountered and idk if i'm just being an immature teen or if i'm justified.  basically i went to the walmart down the street because i needed condoms. i'm 16 and have been told i have a baby face but i guess that's just how it is.

the condoms are locked behind a cabinet thing i guess because of theft or something idk but i asked a lady who was on shift, but wasn't doing anything if she could open it up. she made a comment ""aren't you a little young to be needing those young man"" which really caught me off guard and i sorta just stammered and studdered and kinda embarrassed myself and i just mumbled again that i needed them. 

she basically made a condescending exaggerated ""hmfph"" noise and said ""i outta really call your mama and tell her what you're doing instead of helping you act a fool; you know you don't need to be using these"" before moving towards the condoms. my mom and i go shopping here often so while i personally didn't know this lady, it's not unlikely that she has seen me walk in here with her

here's where idk if i'm ta because she was getting the condoms, but her threat pissed me off and she was being such a huge bitch the entire way that i basically aggressive said ""it's none of your business for why i need these, fuck off and do your job"". she was taken aback at this point and people started to stare and she was like ""excuse me?"" and i said ""you heard what i said"". 

she said i'm not going to be doing anything and i needed to watch my mouth and she's not going to get anything for anyone with that kind of attitude and that's when i got really mad because she was wasting my time and humiliating me in front of the entire store and so i said ""give me a manager if you don't want to do your fucking job then"" and she stammered before refusing, so i ended up asking another employee. 

long story short i ended up getting the condoms, but i'm still so mad and upset that she essentially humiliated me in front of the entire store and my heart's been racing the entire day. did i handle the situation badly? aita?",3
"because i refuse to spend money on my ex's kids despite being well off?. i have a 16 year old son and he has 4 half siblings who are all younger than him. i was only ever with his mom for a brief period of time, and we both agreed prior to sleeping with each other that we were on the same page about not having a kid. 

obviously that didn't work out because she got pregnant (i did practice safe sex and wore rubbers but hey, i'm a dad now anyway)i asked her to abort, she told me she'd changed her mind, and she kept the baby.

i wasn't thrilled about being a dad, after paternity was established i set about paying child support and that was it. i had no intention of wanting to be in his life especially because my own parents had kicked me out and i was still a kid myself.

after a few months though i felt the need to be there and actually be a father, so i put aside my own feelings and put him first. we are incredibly close today and i'm so glad and grateful that i got to be his dad.  i was 18 when i had him, and over the years i was lucky enough that i was able to become financially independent and in essence retire early so i'm able to give my son experiences that i never had. 

he chose to live with me when he was 11, which was a huge sore spot for his mom, but he'd always beg prior to that because his brothers and sisters would break his stuff, and he'd get yelled at because he's the oldest, etc. 

his mom has always been courteous, but over the last few years she has become more and more resentful that my son gets more than her other kids. she is by no means poor, but obviously her resources are spread over 5 kids whereas mine is spread over 1. 

it was his birthday last week and as a gift i bought him a car, which he'll be needing soon anyway and which i've had the cash aside for for *years*. when his mom found out, she called me furiously on the phone and told me i that i'm a piece of shit for making her other kids feel bad, because i've 'never spent a penny on them and every time he goes to visit it's obvious his dad is spending money on him' ... i snapped back and told her that what, she expects me to shell out on kids i have no obligation to just so she doesn't feel bad? 

she said that all the years of them seeing my son go on vacations, his clothes, his mannerisms (what?) etc made her and her kids feel bad, and she told me that i was selfish for having a fund for only my son because none of her other kids will be able to afford college. i told her that's an unfortunate reality for kids who have different parents and it is what it is. 

she's normally pretty level headed so i honestly have no idea why she thinks it's acceptable to ask me to pay for her other kids too- i've never tried to flaunt anything via my kid, i just want him to have the best i can give him.",3
"for essentially siding with my family instead of my wife over their precautions for our incoming newphew?. throwaway cause reasons.

backstory: my wife and i have two kids (9f, 4m). my wife got pregnant very easily, our first kid was even an ""oops"" baby. she had relatively easy pregnancies comparatively, and extremely easy labor comparatively. no major complications or anything like that. 

on the other hand, my brother and his wife have been trying for years and had to endure medical surgeries for my sil, and utilize ivf in order to finally get pregnant after spending who knows how much money. so when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger deal then i would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. for example, their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even open presents. my wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during this that she started to kind of get annoyed with my sil. she would plan certain events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by my sil and she would basically replace it with her own idea. so that whole event left a bit of a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. otherwise everyone in our family has been supportive and excited. the baby is due at the end of this month.

so last night my wife received a facebook message thread, including my parents and other family, from my sil that said in order for any of us to see the baby (either in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, we would need to bring our vaccination records to show that we're up to date on certain vaccinations and have gotten our seasonal flu shot. my wife lost it. she started saying how completely insane my sil and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy and doesn't care to meet our nephew. 

while i said that i agree they are being a bit on the extreme side, i can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality this is probably their one and only chance. they can't afford to go through ivf again and my sil is too old it would be high risk anyway. my entire family, including the kids, are all up to date on our shots, so it's not like it would be hard to comply. we would just need to get our records. i also said i can understand in this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so i can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that we wouldn't put our own family (the baby) in harm's way. but overall, i sort of understand why they're being careful and it's no big deal.

well she took this as me siding with them over her. she's been angry with me ever since. aita?

(also, please don't reply with ""you should always side with your wife! hurrr dee durrr"". i don't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... don't bother.)

edit title: nephew :/

edit 2: while my wife didn't explicitly say it, just knowing her well enough i think the reason she's upset isn't because they are asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking us (and my parents). we are pretty close. we all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every holiday. they watch our kids, we watch their dog, etc. there's always been full trust between us. and i think she feels insulted like we're not being trusted. i don't know if that changes anything? for those of you that said you also asked for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?

edit 3: holy cow, this blew up since last i checked. first of all, thanks so much for the comments, opinions, and advice. to address some common questions/comments... 1) no, sil has no good reason to think we would lie about being vaccinated (or anything else for that matter). once again, we're all really close, if anyone in the family was an antivaxxer, we would all know. and there's no previous issues with trust that has ever existed. 2) no, we did not ensure family was up to date on shots when our kids were born. i feel like the whole antivax thing wasn't as prevalent at the time maybe? it was a while ago, don't exactly recall. 3) it is highly unlikely my wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy. she's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower my sil had. it was more the fact that my sil rejected all her ideas and basically planned it herself. 4) i probably shot myself in the foot on this one with the title... but i didn't really ""take a side"", at least i wouldn't consider it that. it's not like i said, ""well hun, they are right and you are wrong"". it was more the fact that i wasn't as outraged as my wife about the whole thing that made her think i was taking their side (i think?). so take that for what it's worth. 5) i appreciate the folks that could also see both sides of the coin... i feel like that's what i tried to do here. maybe i didn't handle it to perfection and i agree it will probably blow over (hopefully). maybe i'll send an update if anyone is interested.

edit 4: just cause it's hilarious that i actually have to address this... but no, i was not implying that just because the baby is ivf or their ""one shot"" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more typical pregnancy baby. not quite sure how some folks deduced that. i was merely saying that due to those circumstances i could more easily empathize with my sil's somewhat extreme (imo) request for vaccination records, which is why it didn't bother me as much as it did my wife.",3
"for ghosting at parties?. the other day i was at a bbq and was talking with everyone when a friend says to me ""i have a bone to pick with you"". i was a little shocked because i like to think i'm nice enough and get along with people, but i was keen to find out what her issue was with me.


""you don't say good-bye, you just leave"" is what she said, and it's true. i prefer to just leave a party and let everyone keep going. i do it because if i announce i am leaving then people often ask me to stay or ask why i'm leaving, sometimes it makes other people think ""yeah i might go too"" ending the party earlier. i prefer to just disappear. 


anyway i explained myself to this friend and she said ""no it's super rude"". we're australian so i told her to go fuck herself and we both laughed. after that bbq i made a point of saying goodbye to her directly, but i still prefer to ghost. my wife isn't a fan of me doing this but she has long since accepted it.


tl;dr - i like to leave parties without saying goodbye to most people (please read the edits, i do thank the host and i now know it's an irish goodbye). am i the asshole?


edit: i should note that i do try to tell the host i am leaving (if i can get them alone without causing a scene by saying good-bye) and if not i text them to say thanks. it's just everyone else i'm trying to avoid.


edit 2: she was not the host of this bbq, it was my in-laws bbq and she was a neighbour that was invited. i ghosted that event late into the night because my house is a few hundred metres down the road and i was 15 shades of fucked up.


edit 3: fmd my inbox is nuked


edit 4: that this is called an irish goodbye. thanks for all of the support from fellow irish goodbyers. too all the people that think i'm rude, i accept that with open arms and will try tailor my approach a little differently moving forward",3
"for making my pregnant daughter move out before the baby is born?. my 17 yo daughter (youngest and we had her late) is 7 weeks pregnant (she will be 18 by the time she gives birth) she is not in a relationship with the father. he reeaallyyy, i can't stress this enough, does not want a baby. i honestly don't even think he'll show up for the birth or anything.

she has decided to continue with the pregnancy against all advice from practically every adult in her life. after she insisted on not only continuing with the pregnancy but raising the baby i asked her how she is going to manage that? this was the jist of the convo:

her: i'll get a job. 
me: who's going to watch baby while you're at work? 
her: i thought you and dad could.
me: absolutely not, i'm not raising another baby.

pretty much a back and forth for a bit that lead me to believe that if she has this baby in this house, i'm practically going to be its mother. i'm very recently retired  and my husband is retiring in exactly 11 months (there's a countdown) and this is not how i want to spend my retirement years. it's not fair to us. so i told her that she has until baby is born to find a place to live. husband has always been wrapped around her finger (which normally is endearing, i love how much he loves our children) so he is not fully on board with that but i feel like we need to be united on this. i just want to know if  i'm in the wrong here.

aita?

edit: to everyone acting like i'm spending the next 7 months ignoring her- i will help her get a job, get on assistance if need be, find affordable housing etc. i just will not raise this baby.",3
"for rejecting my dad's apology and not agreeing to donate my kidney to him?. 
my parents split up when i was about 7 years old because my dad had an affair and got another woman pregnant. my mom got full custody and my dad eventually stopped visiting my sister and i and stopped paying child support. he justified this as him not having enough money for us and his new family, but either way i had no contact with my dad for around 15 years. about a month ago, he tried to get back into contact with me and apologize for his actions in the past. however, today he asked if my sister and i could get tested as a match because he has kidney failure (which i had no idea about until now) and a possible donor. i rejected his request and told him i wasn't ready (or might never be ready) to forgive him for abandoning me and my sister until now and i suspect he only contacted us in order to get a donation out of us. after rejecting him, he sent a bunch of angry texts about how he would die without a donation from us and basically said i was murdering him. some of my friends also said i should forgive him because he is my father and that i am the asshole for potentially letting him die without the kidney. so aita?

edit: his other kids are still pretty young (~15 and i'm not sure how many other kids he has but i think at least one other) so i'm not sure they are able to donate at their age. also an update: my aunt (my dad's sister) who i also haven't spoken to since my dad left, just messaged me begging me to consider the donation. at this point i'm leaning towards blocking the whole family and just never looking back.

edit2: thank you for all your replies and advice. i've decided to block my father and his side of the family and so has my sister. i realize now that i shouldn't feel any guilt for not donating as this man is not truly my dad.",3
"for ordering a meat dish while eating with my vegan friend.. yesterday my friend 
/acquaintance and i went to a restaurant after work. she is a vegan and ordered a vegan dish. i ordered something that contained beef. 

when my dish came, my friend was shocked to see that it contained meat because she assumed that it didn't (for some reason). she said she no longer felt comfortable eating at the same table as me unless i sent the food back. i said no way i was going to do that.

she said ""maybe we can reschedule"" and that she was sorry but she could not eat with someone who was eating meat.

i said ok maybe we can get our food packed up. we did and then she said she wasnt feeling good and had to go back to her hotel. so i just sat on a bench in the park and ate my food by myself. it was really weird.

"for walking out of an intervention my family surprised me with?. basically, i think everyone's overreacting.

i'm 23 and i got incredibly drunk at a party two weekends ago and ended up with alcohol poisoning. i do relatively drink a lot, but only in social settings. 

i spent the rest of weekend in the hospital recovering. it was a one time stupid mistake. 

yesterday, i went over to my parent's house for dinner. 

when i walked in, they were all sitting in the living room with somebody i'd never seen before.

i asked what was going on and my brother told me to sit down. i did and the man i didn't know started talking. 

to summarize, he said that my family was worried for me and wanted me to go to treatment.

i got upset and said that everyone was being over dramatic and that this was ridiculous. i said that i realized that i had made a mistake drinking that much but this was overkill. i stood up and walked out at that point. 

my mom ran out after me with the interventionist and said that they only did this because they loved me. 

i said that everyone was acting crazy and i hopped in my car and went home. 

my brother has been texting me begging me to reconsider but i haven't answered. 

everyone is crazy overreacting. getting that drunk is not a normal thing for me. it just happened once and i regret it. i have a good job and i look after myself. i don't think i need rehab or that intervention. 

that said, maybe i did handle the intervention the wrong way. i maybe could've responded in a way that made them feel better instead of blowing up.

"aita? told gf to move out and life has gotten 10x harder for her.. hi

i'll keep this simple, and avoid going over the top.

in a nutshell my gf (33) and her little girl (7) moved into my (35/m) house last year.  the house is owned and i bought it because i have two children (8 yo twins - m and f) from a previous relationship.

when she moved her and her girl in i made it clear she was welcome to stay as long as she treated my house as she would her own.

yet when she moved in her amd her daughter did the following over the last year or so.

- left mountains of food everywhere.  - left pans of food on the kitchen counter until it went green with mold.
- got muck/handprints everywhere
- broke and refused to replace things in my house
- would leave the radiators, lights, gas on all day
- refused to tidy up saying she was tired
- left mountains of clothes everywhere
- used the floor as a rubbish bin (ended up with mice)
- constant drama, shouting, arguing - witnessed by neighbours
- literally drained me emotionally and financially
- both of them gave me attitude non-stop, for no particular reason other than to stave the boredom.
- put holes for shelves etc in all my walls
- would spend money on fun things for her and her daughter, yet left me to pay the grown up things like bills, debt etc
- kept leaving the toilet a mess
- treat my own 2 children like dirt when they came over, ie shouting, drama, constantly blaming them for everything etc

when i questioned her on any of these matters she would say i was being controlling.

about a month ago, a serious argument erupted and i told her it's best she leave.  i said 'if you want to live like that, then go and get your own place'.  it was a shame for me to see my hard earned investment become ruined by someone with no respect for it.

we are still seeing each other, but now she has gotten her own place i feel terrible.  she's having to walk everywhere as she dosent drive, and her working hours have altered as previously i was taking her little girl to school to make life easier for her.  also, she was only paying me £165 per month for everything, but now her bills will be in excess of £600 per month for her rent alone.

i feel dreadful for this, i feel like maybe i should have had more patience towards them or been a better guy when they were here.

aita?  or would anyone else have reacted in the same way?


edit: just to follow up - she doesn't drive and i also feel bad that now she has to walk/get the bis everywhere as before i was acting like her own private taxi service.  ie, taking her shopping, giving her daughter lifts to school and to dance classes etc.

update:  wow, didn't expect such a response from this!

after getting many responses, roughly 90% of which say i'm nta and the rest saying i am for staying with her i've decided to break this off.
like some of you've mentioned, i owe this to my children and myself to give them what they need.  a good, solid, strong dad who is happy and secure.  as of this point, she is no longer in my life.

a while ago i asked my 8yo daughter if she thinks about me when she's not at my house, her answer was:

 ""yes i think of you getting shouted at by xxxx""

some of you have said i'm a shit dad for staying with her after all of this.  i would argue against this, but if i stay with her i would have to agree with you all.

update:  i wasnt going to post this, but as many of you are asking about it as you consider it a factor, i'll respond.

a)  no the sex was mediocre at best, once a week if i was lucky.

b)  she never gave bjs

c)  she insisted on me giving her oral sex before we slept together.  every time.  she told me ""go down on me, or there is no sex""

d)  never did anything else.  vanilla sex was as far as we ever went",3
"for not wanting to pay for my stepkid's education despite paying for my own kid?. my husband and i have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). they currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. my husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. 

so here's my current dilemma: i want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. it'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but i've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. however, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. his oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. i was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. 

between our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. i'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say ""ok sure."" and now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. i still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. i feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. however i get that he wants the best for his kid as well but i resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. 

i want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and i want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. for thinking this is a good plan?",3
"if i broke up with my girlfriend over my cat's mental health?. throwaway because she knows my reddit account. hear me out on this one. please? 

&#x200b;

i've been with my girlfriend (we'll call her molly) for about 4 years, lived together for 3. earlier last year our 17 year old cat lost her battle with cancer. i've had cats my whole life and adopted her as a senior before meeting molly. molly never had cats before but adored her, and started talking about adopting immediately. about six months later in december she found a youngish (7mos?) feral male who got a nasty-but-recoverable injury sleeping under a car hood. she fell in love immediately and so did i. i tried to give her the benefit of my experience and told her that this isn't going to be the same as adopting an adult cat who already has a sweet personality, and this kitten will require a lot of patience. she said she understood and we started foster-to-adopting him as soon as the vet gave us the go-ahead. 

&#x200b;

i still love him, but he's highlighted every single thing that's been keeping us from getting engaged. for one, molly refuses to listen to him. he growls, he hisses at her. she started yanking him out of his carrier so often that he's afraid to go in there now. she doesn't listen to me when i try to explain what she could do to get him to warm up to her. she keeps bringing up examples of people she knows who got a cat to like them this way. i work at home, and he's a completely different cat when i'm home and she isn't.  he plays and sits in the window when it's just me and runs under the bed the second she gets home and only comes out to eat. 

&#x200b;

i've suggested to her that we need to start seriously thinking about finding him another home before he gets too old and too scared. every single time i bring it up she accuses me of being callous and giving up on him too easily, and how she never knew pets were so disposable to me. they're not, but she's not a good fit for him. so at this point i'm beginning to think that his best shot is me breaking up with her and taking this poor cat with me.  our relationship isn't that solid but i think it might be fixable if it wasn't for this, but he's a living being and deserves to be happy too.

tl;dr: my girlfriend and i adopted a cat and she makes him miserable. she thinks it'd be cruel to rehome him, so i'm seriously considering breaking up with her and taking him with me. wibta?",3
"if i don't disclose that i'm a product of incest to my present partner or potential future partners. i (22f) was adopted as an infant and never really knew much about my biological family since it was a closed adoption. i received infrequent letters and photos from my biological mother. i connected with my mother, half sister and aunt during my freshman year of high school. i still really don't know anything about my family because my biological mother  is a chronic liar. however, she did tell me that my father was no longer  around and had no interest in meeting me. i talked to my half sister and she said that she was told by our grandmother that it was due to him being a familial relation. i did some research, and was able to corroborate with dna testing that he is indeed my mother's first cousin. obviously that was shocking, and i feel like my existence was a mistake. i've been struggling with it. thankfully, from what i've read, there's very minimal genetic overlap in that kind of relationship and i don't have any medical issues. i do wear contacts, have adhd, generalized anxiety disorder and auditory processing disorder, and i'm prone to getting lung infections (mother smoked while pregnant). but none of these are major in the slightest and i live a very normal, slightly more anxious, life. i'm in a relationship right now, i don't know how long it'll last or if it'll last. i would love to eventually marry him but i'm 22 and i'm  being a realist here. if i didn't tell him since there's virtually no chance our kids would have issues....and also i'm scared that he would break up with me because of it. 

also before anyone makes any kentucky/rolltide, my bio family is from ashland, ky. my life is a meme at this point

edit: i honestly did not think this would blow up so much. really glad this is a throwaway. i guess some info for people.

1. my mother didn't know she and my father were related. growing up she never knew her mother's side of the family as my grandmother abandoned them for her second family. my parents were very much in love and dated as teenagers, it wasn't a sexually abusive situation. they went to the same high school and they didn't look related in the slightest, or share the same last name (i think their mothers were siblings). mother found out when grandma got a divorce and came back into her life, i think they my parents were 18-19 
because it was right after high school. 

2. boyfriend and i have been together about a year, which isn't long but i can see it leading to marriage. also he's not american, so no chance of us being related! trying to keep it out of the family. 

3. views of incest are a bit different here in america for you non americans. especially since i live in a very religious area, my family are strict catholics. it's not illegal everywhere, but it is in some states.

"for refusing to wear a bra while my boyfriend's friend is staying at our apartment?. about a month ago my bf asked if his friend from out of town could stay over for a couple days and i said yes. so the next day his friend shows up while i'm at work. when i get home i greet the friend (who i've never met before). i then proceed to go to the bedroom where i change out of my work clothes and throw on a t-shirt and a pair of shorts with no bra. i never wear a bra at home as i find them immensely uncomfortable and hate them with a burning passion. i then go out to the living room to join them. as i'm sitting down the friend makes a comment, something along the lines of ""dude, put on a bra"". i figure he's joking since he kinda laughed before he said it so i just brush it off. he doesn't bring it up again for the rest of that visit. 

fast forward a few weeks and my bf wants to have his friend over again. so his friend comes over and this time i'm home when he gets dropped off.  i was not wearing a bra when he arrived. i would like to point out that i was wearing a rather baggy t-shirt so it wasn't as if you could really see anything. that being said i do have enormous titties (i wear a size 40i bra). immediately after walking in the door the friend says in an exasperated tone ""i thought i asked you last time to please wear a bra!!""  i'm taken aback and i don't really know what to say. i kind of stammer our a ""what,why?"" 

him: i feel really uncomfortable seeing your boobs 
me: but you can't actually see my boobs 
him: are you kidding me? they're huge! of course i can see them! 
me: dude, i'm wearing a baggy shirt. at most you can see a bit of an outline. i don't understand what about that makes you uncomfortable. 
him: you're joking right??
me: no...? 
him: fucking unbelievable

i look to my bf for help and he  kinda just shrugs at me. so i excuse myself to the bedroom. a little while later my bf comes into the bedroom to see if i'm ok. i tell him i'm fine, just a bit taken aback. he asks if i wanna come play video games with them in the living room and i agree. before we're out of the bedroom though he turns around and tells me that maybe i should put on a bra.  i had explained to him before how i felt about bras. he said he understood but didn't want to make his friend uncomfortable. i was annoyed and told him i would just stay in the bedroom. so for the rest of his friend's stay i stayed in the bedroom and only went out to go to the bathroom, get food, or go to work. 

so finally his friend leaves and everything is back to normal. then last night out of nowhere my bf brings up the bra thing again. he tells me i should've just sucked it up and put on a bra and that i was kind of being an asshole about it. i feel like i should be allowed to not wear a bra in my home but also i wonder if i should've been more accommodating to a guest that's very important to my bf.

"for objecting to 'girls day'?. i'm a 28 y/o male and my immediate family is all women, mostly this is because i was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when i was young. my two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. 


about 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. originally this was to see one of the magic mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. originally it didn't bother me, because i'm an adult and i have my own life, and my own house, and i really didn't even think about it. but an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. my aunt's birthday was in january and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. so i bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. 


when i asked what was going on for her birthday, i was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. this kind of irked me because when i mentioned i bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. i felt pretty left out since i am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. 


i griped about and was told that i was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. i agree with that, but once again, i'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was i was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when i asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. 

at this point i was very annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so i decided i needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. so i removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my facebook. now my phone is being blown up and i'm being told that i'm immature and i need to grow up. i responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and i'm just going to follow that example.

payday comes and goes, no sign of the money. i sent him a message about it. he said ""oh yeah, sorry i forgot, i'll do that now""

this weekend just gone, i was out at a restaurant and i happened to see him as i was being seated at my table. he was on what looked like a date. 

now at this point i could see he was acting kinda boasy because he had ordered about 5 starters. it's worth noting that this is a pretty pricey restaurant. so i decided i'd go and say hello. 

i pulled up a chair at his table and started chatting to him about how he is and how i am etc. 

i then proceeded to pick up a fork and try a bit of the food. he looked a bit shocked, but it was good food so i tried something from one of the other plates. at this point his date (i'd learnt that this was their second date) said to me, ""excuse me, but this is our food. what do you think you're doing?"" 

i looked at her and said ""well since i'm pretty much funding this meal, i figured i may as well sample what my money is getting."" 

i then said to my friend, ""it was nice to see you, i'll leave you to it. we can catch up another day.""

i then left to go back to my table. the people i were with, a party of 10, had very mixed reactions to my behaviour. some were in favour of what i'd done, others not so much. 

so i'm asking you lot, aita?

"for becoming hysterical at a school secretary's expense?. throwaway- im just going to get in to it.

i (19m) got a call from my mother frantically telling me that she got a call from my sister's school because apparently she had ingested peanuts, she is deathly anaphylactic, i was at home for reading week, and am studying for upcoming midterms, but dropped everything and drove as legally fast as possible to get down to the school.

i ran in to the the office which was really crowded. there was only one secretary, and i knew instantly who it was- my mother and alot of other parents complain about her being a short-tempered smart ass.

i ran in but there was a line up, i told her my urgent need to talk to her right now due to my sisters allergic reaction and she looked at me and asked if i was blind ""there's a line hun"".

i waited for about 2 minutes before telling her this really cant wait, she put up a finger and picked up the phone.

i got upset and she called a hall monitor to escort me outside the office until she was ""ready to talk to me"" i was yelling to tell her about my sister's allergic reaction yet she told me she didn't want to hear it. i was in absolute awe at her attitude, especially with the situation i was in.

i dialed 911 because it seemed like the school didn't give any fucks about my sister. the secretary saw me and ran out to to tell me to hang up.

she started by telling me ""see hun, i told you to wait for a reason- there was a mix up, a student told your sister that she gave her something w/ peanuts as a joke, we are dealing w/ that student right now, i could have handled this situation a lot better- i have a lot of students to deal with""

i looked at her and said ""what on earth are you talking about, my sister is deathly allergic and you expect me not to be worried and to wait and do nothing? every fucking second counts in an emergency you fucking idiot, what were you expecting? were you waiting to keep me on edge for as long as possible before telling me?""

i yelled at her for a bit more and she started to tear up and walked off, the monitor told me to leave ""the school isn't going to deal with a hysterical child, we are waiting for your parents, where we will then deal with your attitude""

are you serious? how am i supposed to react in that situation? yes, i agree i was really angry, but i feel like i was justified- my sister could have fucking died, all she had to say was there was a mix up- i would have waited if i heard a logical reason like that as to why she didn't need to talk to me right at that moment. aita?

edit- 

to add context, some people are confused as to why i didn't immediately go to the hospital, the reasons why are because

1.) i don't know what hospital to go to

2.) they were not contacting me, even though im on her emergency contact

3.) from my understanding, she ran to a teacher and told her she was going to have an allergic reaction, so she got sent to the nurse and my mom was notified, before anything went down the idiotic student who tricked her, told the teacher that it was a ""prank"" and that she didn't actually have any peanuts, obviously it was a really dumb and small prank that turned in to a big situation, i guess the faculty themselves were confused about what was actually going on so they were unsure what to actually do.",3

"if i don't attend my sister's $2800 per ticket destination wedding? *i do have enough money.. my sister is having a destination wedding in the dominican republic (all-inclusive).  it'll cost me $2800 dollars to attend (there's no option to adjust the dates/costs. it's for a full week).
my sister would be very upset if i don't attend.  my parents say i should go, and that i'm being selfish for saying i'm not going.  

my sister lives far away and we see eachother once a year due to cost/ busy schedules.   i don't make a ton of money, but i have enough money to attend the wedding and my parents and my sister know it.  while i really want to support her --and would attend a local/ more reasonabley priced destination wedding in a heartbeat-- $2800  just seems too much. and less importantly, i have zero desire to go to an all-inclusive resort as i don't drink or enjoy suntanning.

  in my defence, i've worked hard for my money and i sacrificed quite a lot to be where i am financially.  and while i have accumulated significant savings, it isn't because i earn a big salary. but, because i work long hours, and very rarely spend money on anything beyond the bare essentials.  the cost of this trip would exceed the value of my worldly possessions including my car.  it would also require me using a full week of what little time i get off work.

 i really don't know if i'm being selfish, cheap, and callous or if i'm being reasonable.   last night i almost booked the ticket out of guilt, but, i couldn't do it and have since resolved not to go.  so what do you guys think?  not wanting to attend?",3

"for introducing my gf as a model?. so i have been dating this girl for awhile now. she's beautiful. she works as a professional model. not like an instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything.

she also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. she usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. for some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. she only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.

so the other day i was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. i said ""thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model"" and she shot me this dirty look. later she said i was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and i had no right to correct her. that what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. that her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.

i dont see what the big deal is so here for telling people what she really does for money?

\*\*edit just to clarify i she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. i just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after i did it. also i was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when i introduced her to my friends.

\*\*edit 2 theres so many comments and i am trying to read them all. i do respect her. i do love her for more then her beauty. shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. she's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. honestly i am blown away with how pretty she is and i've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. so that part does excite me.

i genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think i am the asshole for this i do value how much money a field brings in. when i chose my area in college i did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. i am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and i am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. i'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.

i shot an apology text (we're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her dojo. she said we can talk after work and i offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.

&#x200b;

\*\*final edit

at this point i imagine no one is reading anymore i asked the mods if i should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.

i was really bothered by the things people said. not because i wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. i didn't want to be the guy everyone said i was. i really didn't.

&#x200b;

first i want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. yes i knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. we have been dating for around 3-4 months.

&#x200b;

next i want to say she was meeting some of my good friends. i was not trying to ""show her off"" in that she was a trophy for me. i was trying to point out her accomplishments. i thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. i can see where i was wrong. i did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and i felt it was more glamorous. i am an asshole for that. i did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and i'm also the asshole for that too. i wont deny it. but i dont just see her as a trophy. i do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because i learned something really really important.

&#x200b;

after this thread blew up like it did and i had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick i was i knew i was dead wrong and had fucked up. i texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. i asked her if we could talk about it and i could try and make it up to her. she agreed. i told her i wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if i could sit in on some of her classes. she said she would like that. i made it top priority. i left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.

&#x200b;

what i saw really opened my eyes to be honest. i watched two classes and took part in the second one. the first one was her with a kids after school class. she was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. thats dead wrong. it must be much harder to teach kids and i think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. i saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she does want to be a mom one day).

&#x200b;

the second class was a womens self defense class. i took part in this one as ""the bad guy"" and i was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. i got manhandled by about 15 women. we had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. for those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)

&#x200b;

i definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. she taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. most importantly i saw the qualities beyond her appearance that i love most about her really shine. i realized the things i love most about her; her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. this is really the part of her i love. it doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. i also saw how much she loved what she was doing. i saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. i'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong i was.

&#x200b;

i told her this when i went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. she also filled me on the modeling thing. she doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out

&#x200b;

first off its not as glamours as i thought it was

&#x200b;

she said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model

&#x200b;

she works as a model because of a few accidents. she was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. thats all it took for her to be a model. it took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. she started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. she feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. she said being called a ""model"" defines her by her appearance defines her by what she is and not who she is. she doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. she doesn't feel that being a ""model"" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.

&#x200b;

she doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. that she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. she doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. she feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. she wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.

&#x200b;

this is where i lit up and felt i had something to really offer her. i work in finance. go ahead hate me but i do like money. i like to have it, i like to make it, i like the freedom it affords and i like to watch it flow and grow. so i offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. i thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what i know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. we both win. she agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and i will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.

&#x200b;

finally i asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.

&#x200b;

i know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. i learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. in the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why i love her. so honestly thank you yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but i needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. is she the better person? yes she is. do i deserve her. no i dont, but i am going to do better. i really do love this woman, i wont ever do this again.",3
"if i buy my girlfriend a cheap engagement ring?. i guess it goes without saying that i am proposing, but i should mention my girlfriend doesn't know i will be. i picked out a ring i think she'll like. she never wears rings and isn't a massive fan of diamonds. so i found a really nice gold one with an emerald that's surrounding by small diamonds. she loves green and gold jewellery, and i spent a long time finding this one. it's a created emerald which i think she'll prefer because she definitely wouldn't want any sort of conflict jewels. 

the ring is cheap. it was £300 and has actually gone down to £180. i mentioned this to my sister who said i was a dick, essentially. apparently, she'll be showing it to her friends (some of whom are engaged), who will know about rings and clarity and such. she says they will see that it's cheap and it will be embarrassing for her. i'm 90% sure my girlfriend doesn't know much about jewellery and clarity.

i could probably get a similar ring that's more expensive. i certainly wouldn't know why i'm paying more, i don't think she would either. however, i am starting a new job soon and was going to buy a new tv for £250. i kind of realised i'm willing to spend more on myself for a random treat yourself present than an engagement ring and i started understanding my sister's perspective a bit more. so wibta?

edit: i just want to clarify that we have talked about marriage and are both on board. it's the proposal in terms of when and how i do it that would be a surprise.

edit 2: i really want to thank everyone for contributing and helping me out. i left to run some errands and returned to an overwhelming response full of additional advice which goes above and beyond, i really appreciate it. i am not going to be able to reply to everyone, but i am reading and upvoting.

edit 3: thank you for the gold. i haven't found the comment it's on yet. i'm still trying to work through the comments!",3
"for having fun in front of miserable people?. my husband and i rent a house with his brother and wife. we live in a very expensive city and this is quite a big house with great metro access, so that's what's convenient. we get along fine usually.


my husband and i have a son. he's just turned five. the early years were the normal struggle of trying to teach basic human functioning to a kid, but now it's become so fun! during this time there were definitely  low points, when he wouldn't sleep, juggling work and childcare, potty training, etc. there were quite some bad days, but my husband and i got through them and my brother in law and his wife have never been asked to help. whatever their plans are at home or out, we have never asked them to change their plans or watch our kids.


recently they had their own child and are going through the newborn stage. sis in law is on maternity leave and brother in law is working. so a few days ago, i pick up my son from school and we come home before going to a highly anticipated trip to the movies. when we get home, sister is in the living room in tears. it seems her newborn didn't sleep much and has been colicky all day. i sympathise with her and tell her that this stage will be over soon.then my son and i leave for the movie.


today my husband told me that both my brother in law and his wife are angry that i didn't offer to take care of the baby for a while so she could have a break. i'm kind of shocked that i'm being asked to do something that they never have offered to do and we have never asked them to do. i feel like they should take care of their kid just like we did.

aita?

eta: for all those asking if i resent my in laws for not helping... i think any parent would like help. but i don't feel entitled to their help when it's my husband's and my decision to have said child. however i am feeling really resentful right now that they feel entitled to my help and the fact that they never helped me definitely makes it worse.",3
"for not paying to save ""my"" dog's life after my mom ruined its health?. when i (22f) was 11, the family dog died. i was very sad and repeatedly asked my parents to get a new one. they finally agreed, on the condition that i'd be responsible for it and take care of it. that's how i got mickey, the cutest cocker spaniel and best boy ever.

i did take care of him. i took him for a walk every day. started spending my own money to buy him food. i was so motivated with the whole dog caring thing, i even read books and magazines on how to properly educate it. they made a big point of feeding it properly and not spoiling it with human food, so i tried to stick to dog food.

but my mom (53f) would still give him ""treats"" which consisted of pretty much anything she was eating, including sweets, chocolate and cookies. throughout the years i confronted her about it but she'd just brush it off every time. i tried to buy her ""good"" treats, actual dog snacks, that she could feed him, but she continued to feed it junk.

over the years, mickey started gaining weight. he refused to eat proper dog food, eating only my mom's junk food. he also grew very attached to her, mostly because she spent all day at home with him and fed him. i was still the one taking him on walks (not once did my mom do it), playing with him at the park, but he seemed to prefer her company to mine. she'd even make snide remarks about how he'd ""chosen her as his mommy"" and ""liked her better"". this only increased my resentment towards my mom.

fast forward a few years, i had to move away for college. i reluctantly agreed to leave mickey with my parents. his health started to decline even more. my mom didn't take him out at all, and without me to control her, he grew even more obese. every time i visited i'd see the poor thing getting worse and just looking sad and it'd break my heart.

this has been going on for four years. mickey is now eleven years old, half blind and with very limited mobility. last week, he started vomiting blood. my parents took him to the vet and found it's going to need surgery to survive.

that surgery's going to cost roughly $2000. my mom doesn't have the necessary funds and asked me to cover it. i told her i can't do it. i do have the money, but it's nearly all of my savings which i need for myself. i love mickey, but i can't justify spending all my money, specially when his health is so poor and he'll probably die from something else soon anyway.

upon hearing this, my mom accused me of being heartless and ""basically killing the dog"". she said i'm the reason she bought mickey in the first place, and reminded me of my promise to care for him. i told her she's the reason he's dying, and that she's been poisoning him for years.

later my dad called, told me i'm being unfair, that even if my mom hasn't cared properly for the dog, it's wrong to let him die ""just to punish her"". the dog's life is more valuable than an ""i told you so"" to my mom. he asked me to reconsider. i still said no, but now i feel really conflicted. so reddit, aita?",3
"for not trading seats on a plane?. this happened a few days ago and my girlfriend thought i was a bit rude, but i thought i was completely justified.


so we booked tickets for an almost full flight and the only row with 2 seats near each other had someone that already booked the seat in the middle. i figured they did this because they didn't want anyone booking next to them, but they were the only seats left so i booked the window for myself and the aisle seat for my girlfriend. 


when we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he's very proud of it. then he asked if i could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. i was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. i honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. so we denied him, and he just comes at us with, ""you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?"" i answered, ""no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.""


as i said my girlfriend said i was a little harsh and we could have switched seats, yeah it would have been nice to sit next to my girlfriend, but at the time she didn't want to sit next to me either.

"for telling my girlfriend her dream of moving to another country will never happen?. my (25m) girlfriend (23f) has always talked about how it's her dream to move to x country. she brought it up on our first date (we've been together for a year and some change) and has mentioned it practically every other day since. 

at the beginning, i went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we talked about if i would go with her, how crappy our current country is (i'm an expat and she's a local), etc etc 

recently, however, every few times she mentions it, i'll bring up her spending habits. in the time we've been together, she's spent around 8,000usd+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items. 

the last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she'd need to save to get started. 

after we had the number, i started calculating something else. balenciaga shoes + lv bag + gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it's never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things 

she's called me ta, that i'm trying to control her money, i'm trying to humiliate her, make her feel ""small"" and it's none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing

"for telling an infertile woman that ""fur babies don't count""?. alt account. ya boy done gone made a massive whoopsie. 

basically i 20m recently started a job where i have mostly female coworkers. amongst them is a small group who all have young kids around the same age. they go to mum-and-kid activities together, babysit each other's kids, have coffee mornings, hang out at the weekends etc. there is one coworker who has  complained to me a few times that she feels deliberately left out by this group. she refers to herself as ""mama"" and often talks about ""the kids"", so i assumed she had children of her own and sympathised with her that she was being excluded from the mummy group. however, friday i asked to see a picture of the kids...and she showed me a photo of three cats. quickly dawned on me that she's a fur mama with fur babies, which i get bc i love my animals too, but it made it weird to me that she's pissed about being excluded from activities involving actual human children when she has none herself. when she later complained again about not being invited to something i kinda gently said ""maybe it's cause they're hanging out with their kids, i don't know if fur babies really count in that context"". coworker got upset and ran out crying. 

turns out, she's infertile and desperately wants kids but can't have them, so her considering her cats as her kids is how she copes. obviously i feel *awful* now, i didn't mean to insult her or invalidate her feelings like that. still i'm saved a little by the fact that i didn't know, right?

"- my daughter's friend had an anaphylactic reaction under my watch. on thursday evenings my daughter (9f) goes to dance class with her friend anna (9f). my wife told me to pick my daughter and anna up from school, get them something to eat, and take them to dance.

i pick them up from school and ask where they want to go to eat. my daughter asks to go to this noodle place we go to sometimes, and i ask anna if she would like that and she says sure, so we go. we all order and start eating, when suddenly anna looks distressed and said she thinks she is having an allergic reaction. i ask her if she has allergies and she says she does to peanuts... and i look in her dish and it's clearly a peanut sauce.

i rush her to the hospital (we were pretty close so it was quicker than 911 would have been), and everything ended up being ok. i felt horrible. i call my wife when anna is in the hospital room, but there is no answer and i do not have anna's mother's phone number. so after anna is given the all clear i immediately take her back to her house and explain what happened to her mother.

her mother is furious, saying that i could have killed her child. i said back that she should have told me about her daughter's anaphylaxis, why would i assume something like that. she responded that you always ask about a child's allergies before getting them food. she also said that she didn't know i would be getting them dinner (school ends at 4 and dance isn't until 6, so i thought it would be safe to assume i would be giving them food..) i apologized for what happened, but still feel like anna's mother definitely should have let me know in this situation, and also anna is old enough to be aware of her anaphylaxis.

"if i report my doorman for calling me pretentious?. i moved into a new apartment building about a month ago. it's a doorman building and most of the doormen are really nice. i always say a pleasant, ""hi, how are you? have a nice day/evening"" to them when i leave or enter the building, but i don't stop to chat to them as i have seen some of the other residents do.

&#x200b;

one of the doormen (whose shifts coincide with my coming home from work) has this habit of trying to strike up a conversation with me as i'm almost out of the lobby and heading down the hallway to the elevator - like, he'll shout out a question to me, or comment about the weather or something. i usually (pleasantly) shout back an answer and keep walking to the elevator, as i'm always exhausted after work and just want to go to my apartment and relax.

&#x200b;

the other day he shouted out to me, ""come here, miss pretentious,"" so this time i turned around and walked over to the front desk and said politely, ""what did you call me?"" he then proceeds to say i'm pretentious and obviously think i'm better than everyone else in the building because i won't stop to talk to him or the other doormen. his tone wasn't angry or mean really, just kind of jokey but in a condescending way. i politely explained that it's not that i think i'm better than everyone but that i'm just really tired after work and want to go home. i also said i find it weird that he always tries to talk to me as i'm almost out of the lobby, thereby necessitating me turning around and walking back into the lobby in order to have a conversation (if i wanted to). he ended by saying that i won't fit in with the ""culture of the building"" if i keep on refusing to talk with the doormen. i told him (again, politely) that i wasn't really interested in fitting in with the culture of the building and told him to have a good night and i then walked away.

&#x200b;

since then i have seen this doorman twice and both times he has greeted me with, ""hello, miss pretentious"" (same jokey, condescending tone) as i walk into the building. i have completely ignored him both times.

i feel like i should probably talk to him and tell him i don't appreciate being called that, but honestly i just want to report him to his supervisor as i'm getting sick of dreading walking into the building and i feel like i shouldn't have to deal with that in my own home (ok, building). so if i just go ahead and report him? i don't want to get him fired or anything, but i do want him to stop.",3
"for mentioning that i had a chronic toothache while my wife was in labor?. i'm posting this from my wife's account and both perspectives are included. i, the husband, am asking if i'm the asshole. 

this is a topic we've been debating for the past almost two years now. it'd be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. 

my perspective (husband):

my wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. over the prior couple months i had started developing an intermittent toothache. about two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, i probably ate something delicious. 

after eating something delicious, i can't quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. i'm talking sharp, eye-watering pain. her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. 

over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  i didn't want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. 

once they arrived, to my surprise i was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. that with a couple excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife's contractions started to pick up. 

am i the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?

wife's perspective:

my husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. it kept getting worse, and every time he'd complain i'd say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. 

so as he mentioned, as i was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. granted i wasn't in terrible pain, but for a few hours while i was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. 

i did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but i had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment i felt i should be focusing on. 

i'd like to also mention it wasn't just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. 

he is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?",3
"for making my sil cry at her baby shower by suggesting we should stop exchanging gifts in the future?. i come from a fairly well off family, and my husband and i do well  (although we both work high demand jobs for it). we've always been very generous to his side of the family. gifts are very much both my husband and my ""love language"" and in my culture (chinese), elaborate gifts to inlaws are very socially acceptable as a way to show they are held in high esteem. it also helps with some of our guilt for being super busy and not always around. additionally, my side of the family exchanges generous gifts. one concern of mine originally was to treat my husband's family the same as my family, i.e. by not spending way more on my family than his.

last christmas, we had some weirdness over christmas day present opening. i had purchased a lovely cashmere throw for sil (husband's brother's wife). she googled the brand and price then and there (which kind of annoyed me) and later i overheard her make some joke about how she could pay ""half a mortgage payment.""  several hours later during brunch, someone asked her what was wrong (she seemed upset) and she confessed that our presents always make her feel bad, she's tired of us ""throwing our money"" in her and her husband's face, and christmas has become really stressful with pressure over gift giving. husband and i apologized profusely, and did some self reflection afterwards on the unintentional effects of elaborate gift giving and decided to go more low key in the future. although a little part of it has always sat poorly with me since. 

this past saturday, i attended a baby shower for the same sil. it's the first gift giving occasion since christmas and i really wanted to do it carefully. i asked a coworker who recently had a baby what range is typically appropriate (she said she mostly got gifts between $30-$50) and so i decided on three little things from the registry totaling just over $30. anyways, at the shower it becomes clear that while certainly most gifts were in the $30-50 range, all attendees who were family members seemed to give more like $100 gifts. near the end of the event, mil pulled me aside and said that sil felt like i was being spiteful to her for  christmas. i again apologized and as a cover, said that husband and i had written a check for the little one's college fund as well but didn't feel it was appropriate to hand to her during the present opening. then i scurried off to the bathroom and wrote a check for $100. when i found sil by herself for a second i handed her the check and explained that we wanted to give her this earlier but present opening seemed like a bad time. she looked at the check and kind of bitchily said, ""we don't need your money.""

i kind of snapped and told her bluntly (and not like yelling, but not like in hushed tones either - people nearby apparently definitely overheard) that her that i was tired of her shit and if it made her feel better, we could just stop exchanging presents in the future. she started crying and i immediately left. i've been getting my texts from everyone in the family and her best friend about how i ruined the baby shower ever since.

(eta for additional  context - my husband and his family are american and we live in the us. we are in our early/mid 30s, my bil is 28 and sil is 24 or 25.)

(eta2 - i realized her comment might have made the xmas gift sound way more than it was. the throw was 320 pounds, which isn't quite half a mortgage payment, but not cheap either. i purchased it for her during an business trip to scotland last year. it is not fancy looking or flashy at all (light grey)  and not a obvious "" designer"" brand, just an old scottish maker. it was intended to be good quality and last many years. if she hadn't looked it up i don't think it would have been an obviously expensive gift.)",3
"for not letting my boyfriend's best friends use my airline discount after saying they could?. throwaway because all parties know my account name.

backstory: my boyfriend (alex\*) and i have been together for 4 years, i've become friends with his two best friends (james\* and noah\*) but we're not particularly close nor do we ever hang out without him. i work for an airline and one of the major perks is that i get discounts on flights that i can also use for family and friends. as i am in my first year with the company i only get a certain number of discount seats and i had 3 left for the year.

situation: alex asked me if i could use my discount to buy tickets for him and his two best friends. i happily agreed since he deserved a nice holiday. he booked his time off work and they made their plans. they were to send me the money and then i would put it all on my card just for simplicity.

three nights ago alex came home really upset. he told me his friends had decided to change the holiday dates, bringing them forward a week, because it clashed with a concert they wanted to go to. he was upset because he couldn't move his holiday dates with work and when he told his friends they had decided to go without him because they had been looking forward to the gig for ages. i was pretty angry on his behalf especially since he had done most of the planning, including finding the hotel. to make up for i started planning a trip for me and him on his holiday dates.

james messaged me last night and said he would put the money in my account this morning. no ask if he could still use my discount, no explanation for what they had done, nothing. i was outraged that he would even suggest using my discount after fucking over my boyfriend. i sent him a polite but blunt message explaining that he and noah were no longer able to use my discount on this holiday as i would be using the seats for me and alex and that they were still welcome to use them on a holiday that involved my boyfriend in the future. he replied with a barrage of texts saying that i was being selfish and unfair as i had ""promised"" two seats to him and noah and that they were using the money they were saving to go to the concert. he even phoned alex to complain. alex is torn. he thinks it's a little unfair to let his friends down and doesn't want this affecting the relationship between me and his friends so i should just give them the seats to keep the peace. i refused and was hurt that he was still taking sticking up for them.

am i the asshole for going back on my word and choosing to use the seats for myself?

&#x200b;

update: thank you everyone for your support. i must admit i know this seems a bit like a validation post with all the nta votes but i hate going back on my word and i guess i did feel a bit like an asshole just because i've known these guys 4 years and didn't want to make life hard for my boyfriend so i needed some honest opinions. this sub has shown me the light and i will be showing alex this when i get home. he is a massive people pleaser and hates letting people down so that explains it but he's going to get a spine even if i have to grow it in a lab. i'm standing my ground and taking the trip myself. any holiday suggestions?

2nd update: thank you everyone for your votes and insights. it made me realise that even though most of you have voted me nta, there are some things i hadn't considered. i have spoken to alex and shown him this thread (guess i don't know why i used a throwaway) and he actually feels a lot better about speaking to them about it now. he apologised for making me feel bad for standing up for him when he didn't stand up for himself and i apologised for not discussing my choice with him before i told his friends they can't use my discount in the way that i did. he said he's just going to let it play out but he'll be willing to forgive them eventually. so for those wanting a final dramatic update, i don't think we'll be getting one. 
for anyone asking or not believing the story because of this: i don't know the story of the concert, this is the story as i know it from my point of view. they're going to see skepta.",3
"for sticking up for an ex instead of my girlfriend?. throwaway. my girlfriend and i are in a huge/ potentially relationship ending argument. i need to know if ita. 

i'm in a very ldr with basically the girl of my dreams. absolutely beautiful, smart, driven. things have been great despite being a several hour plane ride away from each other. 

she came to town, and i was so pumped to introduce her to my friends. they threw a party, and while on the way, gf randomly asked ""are there any girls i should be worried about"" this is probably where i fucked up,  but i explained that a girl i used to see will likely be there. explained that we were supportive of each other during our respective divorces, and we hadn't seen each other since well before i met gf. i was asked if we ever slept together. i said yes, because...we had. also important to say that we never told out mutual friends about our fling, it wasn't a big deal. 

everything started out great. everyone was so welcoming to gf, including ex who was there with a new guy. 

gf gets drunk and made a comment about single moms dating being weird, almost directly after ex mentioned  her children. she randomly asked why she divorced ex husband...in front of everyone, and then asked, again in front of everyone, where we had gone on dates. i was honestly so surprised. so was everyone else. 

i apologized to ex and her guy as they were leaving, and she said ""no worries. play 23 year old games, win 23 year old prizes"" (were all in our 30s) and gf heard this and sobbed in the bathroom for the rest of the night. she was so devastated that i didn't tell her that was out of line; however, i feel like nearly everything gf said to her was out of line. 

we got into the biggest argument about how i didn't have the decency to stand up for her. i told her honestly, i should have stood up for ex when gf relentlessly tried to embarrass her, and she can't be surprised at a little passive aggressiveness after the way she acted. 

she's now back on a plane, and we will ""discuss further"" once she clears her head.

am i the asshole?

edit for clarification: friends are all in our 30s, girlfriend is 23. 

edit 2: update: i've gotten a ton of requests for an update, so here it is. i admitted that i'm an asshole for how i've gone about things, and how uncomfortable she must have been. i adore her, but i'm not comfortable with the default response being ""i'm jealous, i'm going to be rude to someone i don't know"" 

she is embarrassed and feels that those friends will always ""choose"" the other girl. i tried to explain that they would never choose, that they do love other girl (in their wedding, kid was a flower girl, etc) and that i can't do anything about that, but i do know that every person there has embarrassed themselves drunk in front of each other. every one of them, and i definitely think she can recover. but she doubled down on the jealousy a bit, and the situation made us both realize that we glorify each other from a distance, and that it's probably not going to developed past this. 

for the record, neither me or the other girl have feelings for each other that aren't strictly platonic. yes, i understand her comment was towards me. plus, her new guy is a great guy, and really tried to make her (and everyone else) comfortable in an uncomfortable situation, guess i should take a page out of his book.

"for messing with my sister's fake profile?. going to try to make this quick. i'm 22 and my sister is 18. i went to my sister's room to grab a top she had borrowed(we do this all the time, borrow clothes go into each other's rooms to get them back) and i notice she has facebook open and the profile pic is...well..me. i have to do a double take because it really caught me off guard. i know i shouldn't have but i snooped at the profile and it was just pictures of myself- my sister literally has a fake facebook profile of me.

i'm livid at this point for many reasons. 1. i don't do social media. i'm a private person and i don't like pictures of me to be on profiles like that. 2. some of the pictures she had were ones that she took without me knowing 3. other pictures that she had were ones i had sent to friends which means she has gone onto my computer and taken pictures off.

i delete all of the pictures and i check her computer and find a folder filled with pictures that she has taken of me and ones that were on my computer- not even all of me per se, ones of my friends, group photos, food i had taken pictures of. i go through even more and find out that she has even stolen nudes that i had taken for my boyfriend.

i deleted the folder completely and went back to the fake facebook profile. i uploaded a single picture of her with the caption ""the real me"", changed her name(she was using my middle name and a fake last name) and then left her room. i've heard her sobbing from her room all day but i'm too angry and embarrassed to even confront her right now. for messing with the profile and not just confronting her in the beginning?

&#x200b;

update: i decided to confront my sister since i couldn't stand sitting around with a knot in my stomach. as soon as she saw me she started crying and begging me not to tell our parents and saying she was sorry. i told her that i don't think i could ever forgive her and that it made me sick to even look at her. i asked her why she had the fake profile. apparently she met a guy 1 or  2 years ago on another site and she was too nervous to give him a picture of herself so she sent one of me. he really liked the picture and from then on it just snowballed. she got deeper into it, made the profile and said that she enjoyed all the attention it got her. i brought up the nudes and she played dumb at first, and then said that she must've accidentally copied them over too. i told her that i didn't believe her but she's sticking with that. i asked her to delete the facebook and got the e-mail and information attached to it so that i can change it and make sure she doesn't try to reactivate it. she tried to make me feel bad and tell me that she was gonna lose a lot of her friends because of this and how that was the reason she did it in the first place. at that point i just felt like she only felt bad she was caught and didn't really care about my feelings. i told her that she was being selfish for only thinking about how this hurt her but never thought about how her lies hurt me. she got upset again and i left shortly after. 

&#x200b;

i saw people mentioning that i should change my password on my computer- i've done that. i've explained the situation to my boyfriend and he offered to let me move in with him which i'm probably going to take him up on. i can't be in the house anymore- i feel so uncomfortable and i feel so paranoid about running into people that she may have talked to or sent pictures to. 

&#x200b;

thank you for people that have sent kind words/messages/advice. i really appreciate it. today has been the worst day of my life, hands down. the relationship with my sister will never be the same and i don't think the uneasiness will ever go away.",3
"for telling my so he'll need to limit gym time after baby?. i'm currently 6 weeks pregnant and have a 15 month old. this pregnancy is a surprise and honestly, i wasn't sure we should have another, because we had a rough go with our first. during the newborn phase, i was so exhausted. i was breastfeeding, baby had colic, i was in pain with 3 2nd degree tears, etc. i do not easily fall asleep, so after waking up with the baby at night, it would typically take me another 30 minutes to fall back asleep, and i was roughly getting 2.5 hours of sleep a night for a good 3-5 weeks (it's all a blur now).

my husband had cut back his gym time once the baby was here, but was still going 3-5 times during the week. he would silently be ticked if i asked him to not go to the gym. i truly think he thought he was really pulling his own weight (he'd help with the bath, would feed her bottles, change diapers, etc.). but sometimes, that ""help"" wasn't enough. sometimes, i needed another adult to talk to and to lend me a hand in the evenings. example: one saturday i got up to pump. they were both awake (8:00am). he said he was going to head to the gym since i was awake, and i started crying saying ""please, can you let me sleep a little bit more- she was up all night and i got maybe three hours or so of sleep"" and he got pissed since he had already gotten up with her that morning and let me ""sleep in."" i told him that it must be nice to even have the energy to go to the gym. the only thing i wanted to be able to do was sleep. i got the response ""i'm sorry you hate being a mom!""

now that i'm pregnant again, i mentioned to him ""if i thought the last time was really hard and overwhelming, how the hell am i supposed to get through it while also having a 23 month old?"" i told him this meant he was going to have to help out more and probably not go to the gym as much. well, he did not receive this kindly. he texted me the next day ""just to be clear, i feel like i do a lot. i will not be able to help out with daycare, as i drive a work truck and cannot have another passenger in my car. i will continue to go to the gym, because health is important to me and i need to go to relieve stress. the reason you're so stressed is because you choose to hold and entertain our daughter all the time, while i think it's ok to let her cry if she's bored. you need to think about if you want this baby.

i fucking lost it.

i said ""i cannot believe you would rather me have an abortion than make any more sacrifices regarding your gym time."" but he is adamant that i am the selfish one

"for telling my ex i refuse to share custody of our daughter?. my ex an i have an incredibly long history. we met when i was 18 and he was 19. he was my first love and we dated about a year. but after the break up we continued an off and on again friends with benefits relationship until i turned 23. which was also the same time i found out i was pregnant...

he was going to school to be a doctor and he was in his second year of getting his doctorates when i found out. he also was studying in another state that was on the other side of the country. i got pregnant during one of his visits back home. 

when i found out i was pregnant i told him immediately. he was very very angry and asked what i was going to do about it. i told him i'd be keeping it and he told me he wanted no part in the child's life because it was going to ruin everything for him. i told him that wasn't an option. 

i myself grew up with my birth father jumping in and out of the picture and it's a big stem of my mental illnesses now. all things he knew.

after begging him to be in the baby's life throughout almost my entire pregnancy one day he and his parents called me and offered me a deal. they offered to pay me a very hefty child support until the day the child turned 18 if i never forced him to be a real father. his parents (who are very wealthy) promised to take care of everything.

at first i said no. i refused and called them all assholes and told them my baby was gonna have a dad... but after talking to many of my friends and family they thought it best i take the offer. they told me there was no use in forcing him to be a shitty dad to my baby. i finally agreed about 8 months into my pregnancy.

i took sole custody of course. it's been 7 years and i had a beautiful baby girl that i love more than anything on earth. every single month i get a check and not once has it ever been late. i haven't seen or talked to my ex since the day he handed me the first check. until about a week ago. 

i get a call and it's my ex. he tells me he wants to take joint custody of our daughter. the daughter he has never met in his or her life ever! i was infuriated and told him no. he told me that i can't just say no because he's gonna take me to court where a judge will decide. 

i was crying and screaming and asking why he was doing this. he told me he was sorry but he's ready to be a father and he wants to be there for our daughter. when i told him i was going to fight him with every fiber of my being to make sure he got nothing he told me i was being ridiculous and i need to grow up. 

i've told my family and friends and almost all of them have told me i need to give him a chance and that i'm just being a bitch. the only person that agrees with me is my mother who watched me get torn apart by my fathers constant jumping in and out of my life when i was a child. i know that this is going to be a hard fight and ultimately it is the courts decision but i just feel like i need to fight this. for being so against him getting any custody?

edit: for all the people that are confused about age. we met in late teens. got pregnant when i was 23 and he was 24. i'm 30 now and he's 31.

edit2: for all the people that are saying i'm ta for not getting an abortion. thanks! but i remember asking if i was an ass for telling my ex i'll fight him over custody. please stop telling me i should have aborted my 7 year old daughter. it's very much too late and i never asked for your opinion on that matter.",3
"for scaring my my daughter to teach her not to scare animals?. my daughter is 8, and has developed a bad habit of scaring and disturbing animals for fun.


she would jump from behind with a stomp and a ""wa!"" to any animals minding their own business, be it birds, stray cats and dogs and even butterflies and give them a fright, usually resulting them to either run or fly away. 


we tried talking and scolding her, but she just brushed them off. she thought it was okay as long as she doesn't physically harm them.


so a while earlier she was on the sofa playing nintendo switch, looking very focused, and i decided to let her have a taste of her own medicine.


i approached her from the back quietly before snatching the controller from above(in case she dropped it) with a stomp and a ""wa!"". she was dazed for a moment before bursting into tears. 


my wife called me a childish ah for scaring her like that, but i meant it as a lesson for her to know how animals feel like when she scared them since words could not get to her. aita?


edit: i did talked to her and explain why i did it after she calmed down but my wife got in the way and insisted i apologise and make it up for her. i don't think that's appropriate since that defeats the purpose of teaching her a lesson, so i ended up posting on reddit to see if i am really in the wrong.

"if i tell my bio daughter that i don't want to help her or have her in my life because she decided that her stepmom should adopt her once she turned 18?. my ex husband and i divorced when my daughter was only 5yo. it was a messy divorce which ended in him getting primary custoy. i could have her every other weekend. our marriage hit the rocks after the death of my twin sister. depression hit me hard and i became an alcoholic. i willingly gave him primary custody so that she could have a better life. from then on, i strived to improve my life. i did aa, went to rehab and i've been sober for a long time now. by the time my daughter was 9, i was completely sober. i looked forward to our visits. i was really heartbroken that i didn't get much time with her. 

he remarried and i was really happy that she had a good family to take care of her. but over the years, her stepmom completely replaced me. she called her mom( i don't resent it, but it definitely stung ). she completely took my place at her school events, and after a while, my daughter didn't even inform me about anything in her life. i could clearly tell that she was no longer eager to visit me. i was not financially strong and could not afford all the things that her stepmom could afford for her.

at her graduation, she introduced her as her mother to other parents and i only got one picture with her. i was crushed. and when she turned 18, she asked her stepmom to adopt her. that broke my heart. she did not contact me much after that.

i moved to a different state after that. moved on with my life and i met an amazing man who is now my husband. we have a daughter together. i've completely moved on and i don't resent anyone. i have a great job, a loving husband and an adorable daughter. i'm content. i don't regret or resent anything. 

recently, my bio daughter contacted me and wanted to meet up wuth me. she's 28 now. according to her, she was kicked out of her house after my husband divorced her mother. she fell into depression, did drugs, skipped college and she's jobless. she's pregnant now and she wants me to help her. she apologized to me because she hurt me at that time. according to her, her mother manipulated her. 

idk. i don't feel any connection between us now. honestly, i've moved on and that chapter of my life is closed now. i don't want to open that wound ever. i don't think it will do any good for my mental health and i'm scared of the impact it might have on my young daughter. i don't think i can or should have her back in my life. here??

edit: i've talked to my ex and he told me that the step mom was a gold digger and cheated on him. but my daughter dropped out of college on her own because of her depression and started doing drugs. he tried to help her out but she never improved. so he finally kicked her out an year ago and never contacted her again. he adviced me not to take her in. he doesn't know that she's pregnant.

edit2: i'm helping her find a place to stay and a sponsor for support group. i'm not letting her stay with me for now. i have explained to her that if she's not sober she will lose the custody of the baby and she told me that she'll do her best. thanks for all the replies.

"for dancing well at a wedding?. background: my sister and i have never gotten along. i don't know why, i wish i did so i could fix it but so it goes. i had invited her to come country dancing with me every time i was home, but she never wanted to go.

my date for the wedding was my swing dance partner. we tore up the floor all night long. any time a country song was on, we'd go dance whether the dance floor was empty or full. we were having a blast which was great because i really didn't want to be there since my sister put my ex of 7 years in the bridal party (the groom didn't really know him at all and turns out he doesn't really like the groom). my dance partner asked my sister if she wanted to dance at least three times, she declined, and danced quite a few times with the maid of honor who doesn't swing dance, but can sure follow a lead and killed it!

a few members of my family have told me that my dancing at the wedding was inappropriate and i should have toned it down. they have even gone so far as to tell me that i hired a professional dancer to be my date (he isn't... i met him jr year of college when we started dancing weekly together at a bar)

so my question is, am i the asshole for dancing like i know how to dance or should i have dialed it back a but for the wedding?

edit: just so it's not hidden in the comments because it's been the center of why most think i'm the asshole, we were doing aerials, not every song, but they were there. 

i've seen some follow up with thank yous and such on the posts, but since this is my first timing posting i'm not sure when to do that. thanks everyone, you all are right, i didn't think that i had done anything wrong coming into this, but wanted to get the crowd opinion. it seems like popular vote is i made an ass of myself. i just wanted to say thanks for the perspective check. you all gave me some stuff to think about. i had never heard the etiquette rules about aerials either, so that's good to know now too. i always thought that was just a bar rule.",3
"for asking my wedding guest to leave for wearing his military uniform at my wedding?. the son of one of my husband's family friends showed up to my wedding in his marines formal wear, complete with all his medals. now, i have nothing against anyone in the military but this was a black tie optional wedding and frankly it felt very out of place and it seemed like he was just trying to show off. my wedding had over 300 guests and nobody else felt the need to wear something to make them stand out.

up until the point that i asked him to leave, he of course was acting very well mannered and like a complete gentleman, as one might expect from a member of the armed forces, and there were even a few excited teenage girls at my wedding who wanted to take a picture with him, to which he graciously agreed. many people were thanking him for his service, and frankly it just felt like the only reason he wore that was to be in the spotlight and make it about him, which i don't think you are supposed to do at someone else's wedding. if he wants to wear that to his own wedding then fine, but the whole point of having a dress code at a wedding is so that no one guest will stand out too much.  i felt that he should have known this, since the whole point of uniforms in the military is so that you don't stand out from everyone else!

i felt kind of bad about asking him to leave, but it just didn't feel right for him to be there like that.

"if i ended my friendship with my best friend who is gay?. alright, hear me out, because i know how this sounds. i (22m) have been best friends with ""john"" (22m) for about 6 years. we always had a fairly affectionate relationship, but i never really thought much of it. about 5 months ago, john came out to me and i was completely supportive, but to be honest i started to consider some of his actions in a new light. 

for example, he tries to cuddle with me, hug me from behind, etc. i am completely supportive of him being gay, but some of these actions are making me uncomfortable. also, he is pretty possessive and gets very upset if i ever spend time with a girl over him. he always says things like ""you don't care about me anymore!"", seemingly just to get me to say that i do. it's getting pretty exhausting, and frankly i am starting to wonder whether he has a crush on me based on his behaviour.

i told him about a month ago that i would appreciate if he reduced some of these behaviours, and he did not take it well. he was upset, and again it was about how i am trying to push him away. we haven't hung out quite as much since, but when we do there is just as much physical contact as before, even though that is one of the issues that i addressed.

i feel like i can't put up with this anymore. i want it to be clear that i have **no issue** with him being gay, but i would just prefer if these actions were not directed towards me.

"for refusing to lift something heavy for a woman as a man?. i was asked by a female coworker to lift something heavy in the kitchen while i was working at my desk, but when i got to the kitchen, it was filled with other women having a conversation during working hours. i was offended that she would go out of her way to ask me while i was working just because i was the nearest available man, so i refused. the other women were clearly offended by my decision and some thought i was joking, so i kept on refusing until one of the women gets fed up and lifts the dang thing with ease. i thought one of them should have done it in the first place.

am i the asshole?

edit: to clarify, the women in the break room weren't on official breaks. they just happened to be there because they all needed a second round of coffee and started a conversation amongst themselves. there are no official break times in my workplace. also, i was working on something at my desk when i was asked to lift said object.

edit 2: at the time of being asked, i was asked to help ""lift something"" in the break room. i assumed it was a package of mail or paper and i didn't know i'd be doing it myself, nor did i know it was merely to replace a five-gallon bottle of water for the water dispenser.

edit 3: this was not the first time in the day i refilled the dispenser. i'm the closest man who sits near the break room, so i'm regularly asked by superiors to change it and am not in a place to refuse my boss. however, the woman who asked me is not a superior and isn't exactly petite either — none of them in the break room are. furthermore, the cap on the bottle is one of those that prevents spills by being pierced when it's placed on the dispenser. i have also witnessed a 4'11"" woman change the bottle, so height isn't exactly much of an issue here.

edit 4: the woman who asked me does not have a poor relationship with the other women in the break room. she is also married with children and i'm the only openly gay man in the office, so, no, i highly doubt she was trying to flirt with me as suggested by some here.

edit 5: i never lost my temper or became argumentative during all this, but some here assume i did. i just refused to do the task for her.

edit 6: i am not the strongest person in the office — far from it. i don't lift weights and stay slim out of preference. we even have some female gym fanatics here. also, i barely know the woman who asked me. she's in another department in another part of the office.

update: i very much wanted your responses because of a follow-up discussion with one of my female coworkers who was within earshot when all this happened. she still defends chivalry, while i obviously find it illogical. our office is currently going through a renovation and, while clearing out a storage room, we discovered our old water dispenser involved in all this. yes, everything i posted happened almost a decade ago. our discovery sparked a heated discussion and i wanted to put the issue on this subreddit for others' viewpoints to close our debate. i put little effort in my original post without thinking i'd get so many responses, so my apologies in advance for the list of edits.

i'm still employed with this company, and some involved have left. if there was any hostility towards me afterwards, it was not noticeable and certainly played no role in my eventual promotion. i'm glad to have played a part in changing the minds of my female colleagues. it's no longer a habit for them to look for a man when some physical exertion is involved, and i am often told by women to let them handle tasks once exclusively done by men. our head of hr also announced in a staff meeting that we'll be employing more men to bridge the gender gap in our office, and some married coworkers told me they've even made positive changes at home as well — all stemming from a seemingly petty ordeal.",3
"for not giving the source of my beaded earrings to a white woman?. i was born on a res and lived there for most of my life until going to college in a nearby state. in my community, we have a number of talented women who are amazing at beading. they make some truly remarkable stuff. caveat is that they will only sell or trade to other people from the community, and possibly another tribal group. it's just how they do it. 

i have 30 or so pairs of all kinds and wear them with pride. almost every day i wear a brick stitch earring of some kind, it's just part of who i am, where i'm from, etc. brings me a lot of joy.

anyway a woman at work has really fallen in love with them. she compliments them and examines them. no issue there. lots of people do. one day recently though, she asked me where i got them and if the person has an ""etsy"" shop or something where she can buy her own. this woman is white with not a drop of the heritage in her, by her own admission. 

now... personally i have no issue with white people wearing the earrings! it's not about that. wear whatever you want. but the women in my community do not sell them to outsiders (again, for the most part). it's just not done. 

i told her no, and she asked for the contact information so she could commission a pair. i told her no again, that the person who makes them is very particular about who she makes them for. she kept pressing me, telling me ""well let her make that decision!"" and stuff like that. 

i got tired of this and told her, point blank, this person will not create or sell anything for you because you are white. she got extremely upset and threatened to make a statement to hr about me being racially discriminating.

aita? 

my reasoning is that if she wants beaded earrings, she can learn to make them herself, she can buy them from anyone else (there are so many white women on etsy who make ""boho style"" earrings), etc. she is merely upset because this one person will not cater to her.",3
"for expecting my daughter to help her brother?. me (50sm)

my daughter (32/f)

my son (27/m)

i love my kids equally.  

my daughter lives at home rent free, which has allowed her to pursue her passion.  we don't charge her rent and so she's built up a good deal of savings (~50k).  

my son is a bit more aimless.  he has a college degree, but he and his girlfriend have chosen to pursue a more nomadic lifestyle.  he supports them (gf doesn't work) and does odd jobs/gigs.  they have lived in airbnbs for two years, until about a month ago.

last week, my son came to me to speak in private.  apparently, they have been living off of credit cards and now my son owes ~30k.  there's no way he'll be able to pay that off on his current job.  he has moved back in and is looking for more steady work, but it's going slowly as he has little career history to speak of.  meanwhile, the creditors are calling constantly.  the debt will inevitably grow with interest.  my wife is pushing hard for son to file for bankruptcy to manage this. 

i don't want my son to file for bankruptcy.  it would be a huge stain on his credit and make some jobs impossible to get.  i believe my daughter should loan him the money out of her savings.  when i pass all my children will have is each other.  they should learn how to rely on each other more.  

i told my daughter i think she should loan son the money.  she got extremely angry and left to live with her mom.  her mom, my wife, and my daughter are all angry at me now.  

aita?

eta: hey everyone!  it's vish, or ""son"" i guess lol.  it's been an interesting time being the most hated dude on reddit, but my dad won't be answering more questions or responding to comments.  honestly i didn't even know my dad knew what reddit was, so getting to the first page has been an experience to say the least.

"for being too honest about having a baby?. so as i write this i'm feeding my 7 week old son. i am totally in love with him, he is amazing. however... the process of bringing him into the world was not good. at. all.

in order to explain why i might be an asshole i think its important to explain the circumstances surrounding my sons birth.

i had incredibly bad morning sickness, to the point that i weighed less at the end of my pregnancy than before i conceived (my bmi was 23 pre pregnancy). i could barely walk due to bad hips, my stomach muscles tore apart, and i got a ridiculous number of stretch marks all across my stomach and back.

then came labour and delivery. i was in labour for 92 hours. my son was back to back, so i was in agony. i had two failed epidurals, ended up on gas and air, paracetamol, and morphine, and still spent hours screaming into the abyss. in the end his heart rate dropped and i had to have him delivered in theatre by ventouse.

i ended up with a second degree vaginal tear, which got infected. my son was ill following delivery and ended up in the nicu for a few days. i had issues breastfeeding once he was out of nicu, and ended up getting mastitis twice within a week, before my milk supply dried out totally. i spent 12 days in hospital total before going home.

once home my son got ill again and ended up back in hospital on three occasions.

he's finally better and we are finally a normal happy family at home.




so why aita?

well, before i got pregnant / gave birth people would tell me how magical pregnancy was and how giving birth wasn't that bad and that you forget the pain as soon as you hold your baby etc. which, pardon my french, is bollocks. i still remember every moment of pain and currently don't believe i could mentally deal with another pregnancy.

part of the reason i think i have struggled so much emotionally with all the issues i had was that my experience totally jarred with my expectations. nobody told me that everything can go wrong. i didn't expect my birth plan to go as i hoped, but i thought i might get some things i wanted. i never expected to have such difficulties feeding my son. i didn't prepare for him being ill. i didn't prepare for feeling totally helpless and useless.

so when my childless friends (who planned on having children in the future) asked me how labour and delivery went, i was totally honest.

i didn't sugar coat anything. i explained everything exactly as it was, and told them of the problems we had as they happened. i have been very honest in saying that whilst my son was worth all the pain, i probably won't be doing it again.

well my friends have said that i'm an asshole for being so honest as i've put them off having children in the future. i didn't mean to scare them, but i felt that i would have rather had more realistic expectations of what could happen.

i don't feel like i should apologise or say that i exaggerated anything to make them feel better, but maybe i'm wrong.

"for getting defensive about a birthday gift i gave to a friend?. for a friend's birthday i got him a budget record player from amazon along with 10 old vinyls from a second hand shop. he is pretty into music so i thought it would be a cool gift. plus i'm tight on money to give him anything more expensive.

after i gave him the presents at the birthday party he opened it to test it out. here enters pretentious music snob (pms), he starts fiddling with the record player, as soon as my friend opened the package.

pms: (asking me) how much did you get it for?

me: 60 dollars.

pms: (friend's name) be careful of the needle. it's a cheap vinyl player and it might scratch the records.

i thought that was a weird thing to say, considering that he was right in front of me, but i gave him the benefit of the doubt since it might actually be useful advice.

my friend put on a vinyl and it started playing. 

pms: the speakers sound pretty crap.

friend: i think it sounds fine.

pms: you know what you can do? you should take out the speakers from the player and rewire it to better speakers to improve the sound. here's the setup i have at home. (pulls out his phone, starts showing him stuff) the one that xxx gave you is like the cheapest record player you can buy so it's not going to give you a good sound.

at this point i was pretty annoyed. he might be right, but i think it's a dick move to straight up say that my gift crap when i was right next to him. so i decided to call him out.

me: hey look, if you think that my gift is trash, why didn't you get him something better yourself instead of a 20 dollar gift card? (yes, he got him a 20 dollar gift card for my friend's 18th)

the room became silent and it got pretty awkward. i know that it's the thought that counts and it's bad to compare the value of the presents that you give, me calling pms out about the value of his gift might be shallow and petty, but i reckon that he deserves it for talking shit about my gift right in front of me.

so aita?

edit: i posted this before going to bed (i live in australia) and woke up in the morning expecting like 50 comments but holy crap this blew up. here's some additional info:

when birthday friend opened the present, everyone gathered around and was watching because we're (mostly) 18 year old who have never seen a record player at work before. so when pms was pointing out the flaws in my gift, it was to everyone at the party since all the attention was on the record player, and thus him at that moment. 

to be honest i'm not a confrontational person and i wouldn't have said anything until the point where he pulled out his phone and showed birthday friend what he thought would be better gifts, that was the last straw for me. i said what i said to a) shut him up, i wasn't in the mood for listening to him saying how bad my gift was for 10 more minutes b) yes i said it in a way that embarrassed him. i'm not a saint, i didn't take the high road, but i sure as hell feel good about standing up for myself. 

when i said the room went silent and awkward, it was like for 10 second. i've apologised to birthday friend over text for making a scene, he said to not worry about since pms was also annoying him. 

i posted this to see if my response was appropriate and that i didn't over escalate it. my conclusion is that sometimes you gotta be an asshole yourself to stand up to a bully and i don't regret what i did.",3
"for refusing to speak english to around my stepdad. i'm half japanese and my family recently moved into my stepdad's house.  i speak english with my brothers but japanese with my mom. at the dinner table, my stepdad will get angry if we speak japanese because he feels left out.  he frequently stands up and declares that he is left out and leaves the room to watch tv.

i have major problems with him as he frequently trash talks my dad and screams at us.

i live in australia and my mother is the only connection i have with my japanese heritage and being able to speak japanese is really important to me.

i don't feel obligated to speak english around him just because he wants to hear what i'm talking to my mom about.

"for not letting a family member i barely know drive my expensive car in an ""emergency""?. i was at my in law's house yesterday, alone with their god daughter (we'll call her ashley, she's 28), while my husband was out doing stuff with his parents to discuss important family matters. i was already feeling pretty stressed and anxious about how their conversation was going to go. i don't really have a great relationship with ashley, so i was just keeping to myself in one of the guest rooms on my laptop with a large glass of wine. about an hour later she comes in, panicked, asking if she can borrow my car. apparently, her high school aged sister got in a really bad fight with their extremely dysfunctional father and needed to be picked up.

my car is a new mercedes that cost me around 80 grand. i absolutely did not want her taking my car, especially somewhere that was almost an hour away. i asked her if their dad got physical with her sister in this fight and she said no. so, i told her i would rather her wait until my in laws got back and see if she could take their car. 

she starts yelling at me that they probably won't be back for a few hours and she needs to get her sister asap. i told her that unless she believes her sister's safety is at risk, i don't feel comfortable with her taking my car. she asked if i could drive her to get her and i told her i had too much wine to drive. she then proceeds to shit on me for being ""irresponsible"" for drinking and not anticipating i might have to drive, as well as ""selfish"" for not letting her take my car.

when they get back, she asks to take their car and makes a huge deal about how i wouldn't let her take mine. she goes on about how my ""fancy car is more important than a child in crisis"". i told them she said the girl wasn't in any danger and she tells me to fuck off before she gets in their car to leave. 

my in laws said she's just being an overprotective big sister and not to worry about it. when my husband was driving us home he told me i made the right call because ashley is a very reckless driver, and totalled a car a couple years ago after driving too fast. however, the next morning my in laws text me that ashley was incredibly upset and i should have just let her take my car. 

so, am i the asshole here? like i said, she told me the kid wasn't in any danger. i feel like i'm being shat on for having boundaries. am i off base?",3
"for contacting the mom of my daughter's (15f) boyfriend (15m) regarding some concerning behavior and messages?. so my 15 year old daughter is in her first ""serious"" relationship with a boy she was friends with before they started dating.  i put serious in quotes because while they spend time together frequently, they are only ever alone in public places like the mall.  my daughter and i have a good relationship and she has shared that they haven't done anything more than kiss at this point.  i am not naive enough to think they couldn't be doing more, but my daughter has given me no reason to mistrust her.

the problem is that the more time they spend together, the more demanding of her time the boyfriend is becoming.  he calls and texts her constantly and gets upset when she doesn't respond immediately.  she has explained to him that she is not tied to her phone, especially during the summer when she is doing things outside or with friends.  he has told her that he worries about her when she doesn't answer, and if she really loved him she wouldn't make him worry.  she recognizes this as manipulation and has told him that it is not okay.

she sat him down and explained that she does not like how demanding and controlling he is becoming, and explained that if he doesn't stop she will break up with him.  i was very proud of the way she handled it.  we have taught both of our kids that it is important to define your boundaries and then expect the people around you to respect them, as well as taking the time to understand and respect the boundaries of others.  i think this is especially important as they navigate their teenage years.

last night while she to a 30 minute bath he called her 7 times and sent her over 30 texts that started with him just saying ""babe, call me"" and culminated in him saying there would be consequences for her ignoring him.  it was the last straw, and she told him she was done.  he then blew up her phone until she blocked him and removed him from all of her social media.  he then started contacting all of the people in their shared group of friends, trying to get them to talk her into giving him another chance.  she.  is.  done.

as a mom, i would want to know if my son (13m) was treating someone like this.  i recognize that this is a learning experience for both of them, and hope that this boy can learn to have healthier relationships on the future.  for contacting his mom and letting her know everything that has been going on?  we have chatted in the past, and i have her contact info, so it would be easy to get in touch with her.  or would i be overstepping my bounds by getting involved, since at this point my daughter seems to have done a good job of handling things on her own?

&#x200b;

update:  i talked with my daughter tonight and told her that i was considering calling his mom to discuss his behavior.  (for the record, i would have done this even without all of the suggestions to do so.  i respect her enough to keep her in the loop.)  i explained that i don't think she could have handled the situation any better than she did, and i am so proud of her for advocating for herself and her boundaries.  but i have concerns about the way he continues to stomp those boundaries and try to manipulate her.  i am also concerned about his future relationships if he doesn't make some serious changes, which probably won't happen without some intervention.

she was not upset at all and said she understood why i would want to call his mom.  she asked that i wait a couple of days to see if he stops the behaviors on his own.  we agreed that if he is still trying to call and text her and her friends by friday, i will make the call.  as a side note, the friends he has contacted have all told him that he needs to give her space and understand why she broke up with him.  she is lucky to really have a great group of friends.  

&#x200b;

also, for those of you who have asked... from a very early age we have always emphasized the importance of boundaries with our kids.  we never forbid them from being friends with kids we saw as potential bad influences, but focused on what makes a good friend.  when problems arose, we would talk to them and help them see when someone wasn't respecting them (or when they weren't respecting others).  so her recognizing that he was being manipulative and needy was an extension of that.  i'm so happy that years of those types of conversations worked and she has a very good grasp on what health interactions look like!",3
"for selling my son's home because they decided to be childfree?. i know the title sounds bad but hear me out.

i'm 47f, my husband is 49m, my son is 28m, his fiancee is 27f.

when my son proposed, we talked to both he and his fiancee to find out their game plans for the future. we wanted to buy them a house but one question decided *how big*: do they plan on having children?

their answer was ""yes"", so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. at least in our names, our family is protected. we think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing.

they've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this october. but we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. this is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. but it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption.

we would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. but instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. this is like the difference of a factor of two. we spent our money needlessly.

i'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. my husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. i don't think they did it with malice ""hehe we get a bigger house if we lie"", but i think they knew they didn't want children. you don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right?

would i be the asshole for selling their home? we'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. they'd never be homeless.

**edit**

just so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. the problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. children need extra space. now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house.

our other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. in our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. this is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. there's already been hubbub between my children ""why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom"", etc. ""because they're having children"" can't be our reasoning anymore.",3
"for refusing to wear a wig to my friend's wedding?. just as a little background, i grew up in a very strict christian family where i wasn't allowed to cut my hair, ever, because ""hair is a woman's crown"". it was down to my knees by the time i escaped at 18. ever since then i've either had a pixie, a buzz cut or have been totally bald, because i cannot stand the heavy feeling of long hair or all the brushing/washing/detangling after dealing with it for so many years. so that's a big reason i'm so stubborn about this issue. also, all of my friends involved in this story have always known me as the girl with no hair. right now i'm bald because i always shave my head completely for the summer. 

one of my good friends is getting married in august and she chose me to be one of her bridesmaids. everything had been cool, she's always been the sweetest person and she showed no signs of going bridezilla before this, until she called me up about three weeks ago and asked me if i could do her a favor and wear a wig to her wedding. she explained that she wanted all of her bridesmaids to match and that she wanted us all to look good in the pictures. i told her i really didn't want to get a wig, and we've been on bad terms ever since.

all of our friends are on her side because ""it's just a wig"" and ""it's not like she's asking you to grow out your hair for the wedding, so she's not the one being unreasonable."" and i know i can be very stubborn sometimes, which i guess is the reason i'm posting here. 

the thing is, i don't know how many of you will be aware of this but a wig that will actually look good/realistic is expensive. i've already paid for a bridesmaid's dress, new shoes, and plane tickets, as well as a small deposit for the person who's going to do our makeup. this wedding has already cost me a fortune. i could afford a wig if i wanted to, but do i really want to spend the money on something i'll never wear again when i've already spent a ton? not really.

also, this is going to be on a plantation in louisiana. in august. i'm already going to be hot and uncomfortable, and a wig will make things a thousand times worse. 

my biggest reason-and this is why my friends are saying i'm the asshole-is the principle of the thing. i feel like it implies i look bad because i don't have hair, which i personally don't think is true. is being bald so hideous i'll ruin her pictures? is she going to make her balding father wear a toupee? and i think the ""i want us to match"" thing is stupid. we're already wearing matching dresses, why isn't that enough? i know it's ""her day"" and we're supposed to make her happy, but isn't there a line? 

i've offered to wear a cute headscarf as a compromise if my bald head is that offensive, but she's not having it. i'm still in the bridal party and invited but i don't know for how much longer, honestly. for not wanting to wear a wig?

edit: just to add two things: 1. she's not willing to pay or reimburse me for the wig, in part or in full 2. along with the headscarf i'd also be willing to grow my hair out into a pixie cut, the wedding is at the beginning of august so it'd still be really short though.",3
"for saying in class that i don't care that my bully classmate is dead?. i (17m) was horrendously bullied by this guy, we can call jake (17m). jake was quite popular and sociable but for some reason kept targeting me, calling me names, slurs, etc. i hated him so much, i'd hate going to school and him being in class. i dreaded it.

well we found out that jake unexpectedly passed away in his sleep. when i saw this on facebook, i saw lots of rip posts from classmates, but my first reaction was relief. i felt a weight lift off my shoulders.

when i came to class, people were crying and my teacher (50f) said we need to take a moment silence for him. after the silence was done, i just said out loud ''i don't care that jake died. he was a bully''. people looked at me instantly and gave me death stares, i could hear some people muttering swear words.

but then some people came up to me and thanked me, they said they hated jake too. honestly i'm fucking glad he's dead. i feel so much better about my life now. some classmates called me ah, his girlfriend (ex now lol) came up to me and called me every name under the sun, ah was one of them. i just said to her ''you need to calm down and relax'' and walked away. 

i honestly feel good and so do some other classmates. aita?

**edit - the reason i say 'now ex lol' is because she chose to be in a relationship with an awful, awful person. that's bad character judgement on her part, and also complacency.**

"for being upset that my parents gave my wedding fund to my sister to freeze her eggs?. i want to preface this by saying that i've been 100% financially independent from my parents since the day i graduated college. i know they don't owe me a dime and i'm grateful for everything they've given me in life. 

i have a sister who is about a decade older than me, and my parents promised each of us a set amount of money towards our weddings. my sister used this money to have a big, beautiful wedding and i'm happy my parents were able to help make her special day like something out of a fairytale. now it's my turn to get married, but my parents have admitted to me that they gave away the money they had saved for my wedding to my sister. 

my sister, a mother of one, had a series of health problems and had to freeze her eggs if she ever wanted to have another child. she didn't have the money and only had a few weeks before her hysterectomy so she asked my parents for the $13,000, which they obviously gave her. my sister was absolutely devastated by her health issues and scared, and because they're great people, my parents were willing to do anything to make her feel better. 

i know i sound like a selfish, vapid bitch for prioritizing my wedding over her fertility, but she was 36 when she got the diagnosis. there was no telling how long it would take for her health to recover, and it would be years before they could even afford supporting another infant, let alone the tens of thousands a surrogate would cost. i knew she would never have the means to use those eggs before she was 40, and she has made it very clear that she wouldn't want to have an infant at that age. in my opinion, she acted in panic and wanted a safety net that she knew she would never use. i don't blame her for being scared. i would have been terrified to. 

but i'm still upset that now i won't be able to have much of a wedding because i had been counting on the funds my parents had promised. i'm not so much upset that they gave it to her, but i am upset that they gave it to her *knowing* nothing would ever come of it. that they traded my wedding day for her brief peace of mind. my sister has confirmed already that she and her husband will not be having another child. 

when my parents told me there was no money, they were obviously stricken and apologetic. i couldn't hide my disappointment. i really tried to reassure them that i understood, but they could tell i was hurt. my sister called later and told me that it sucks i can't have a 'fancy wedding' (like hers) but basically i need to grow up. which seemed hypocritical, since she made such a big deal out of her wedding needing to be extravagant. she said she's sorry, but at the time her future children were more important than one day in my life not being as nice as i'd hoped. 

i know this isn't the end of the world. this is dumb and petty in the grand scheme of things and i feel ridiculously shallow for being so upset over losing my dream wedding. i'm still getting married. my wedding won't compare to my sister's, but i'm still marrying the love of my life and it will still be an awesome day. 

thanks for sticking with me through the story. i know plenty of you are rolling your eyes over the dramatic bullshit that comes with weddings. so, am i overreacting? aita?

"for telling my boyfriend i don't want a penis?. this whole argument is really weird to me. basically, i'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, ""i bet you wish you had a dick."" to which i responded, ""no, not really."" 

he seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why i did not want to have a dick and i basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like i don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. hard pass. he got weirdly offended by this and said i was being sexist??? i told him that i observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if i had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. he got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me ""think about"" why what i said was so upsetting. 

i don't get it though? not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? y'all help me out lmao

edit: it's funny y'all keep mentioning freud. my boyfriend is studying psychology and actually obsessed with jung. like y'all know that post about that guy who was obsessed with jordan peterson to the point his girlfriend left him? he's that level obsessed with jung. 🧐",3
"for not allowing meat to be served at my wedding?. i'm a gen 1.5 indian migrant to the uk (was born in india but moved when i was 6 with parents) so while i grew up british and consider myself to be british, i still have family in india and my indian heritage is an important part of my identity. my wife is 4th gen indian - her family immigrated decades ago so she, and her parents grew up fully anglicised. i'd like to stress there's nothing wrong with that - why should she have ties to a country her grandparents were born in?

due to the difference in culture we are having two weddings - one in england for all her family and our friends, and one in india for the rest of my family and friends there. we had the first wedding, which was very traditional and western  - church, reception etc. it was great, and we had fun. now the wedding in india - it's important as my grandparents are too old to fly to the uk so i'd love for them to see me get married. 

the problem comes with the menu - in a hindu wedding, and especially in the south, you don't serve meat. you just don't. in fact, what's served at a wedding is something called a sadya(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sadhya). it's fully vegetarian, and served on a banana leaf - super traditional. my wife says we should allow meat, despite the cultural taboo - saying her side of the family 'won't be able to cope' without meat. i'm of the opinion that they're all adults, and they can live with the inconvenience - hell, if it's that bad run to a kfc after the ceremony and gorge yourself - but at the wedding itself, no meat. it's also not like there won't be any meat - there'll be non veg food at the sangeet, there'll be meat at the reception. 

also during the english wedding i sided with her over my parents over the serving of beef - my parents, being hindus don't partake, but i told them they should just eat something else, not ask that beef not be served entirely. 

so, for not wanting meat at the wedding?",3
"for asking my coworker why he's married?. (throwaway with names changed because i know a few of my coworkers use reddit.)

so there's this guy at my work, james, who makes derogatory jokes about his wife. any time his spouse comes up in conversation, he'll make one of those 'oh, my wife is such a nag, the old ball-and-chain, *women*, eh?' jokes.  he'll always say it with a big grin and then laugh, but he does it *constantly*.
  
and when i say constantly, i mean constantly.  in the three years i've worked with james, i've only heard him mention his wife without making a joke along those lines maybe three or four times.  it really gets on my nerves to hear him trash talk her all the time.  

today another coworker of ours said that he was making plans for his anniversary with his wife, and james butted in and said ""oh, yeah, mine's coming up soon, too.  i guess i need to do something or i'll never hear the end of it.""

and i kind of lost my temper and asked him ""if that's the way you feel why are you still married to her?!"" 

james kind of sputtered a bit that he was joking, and i told him that he always talks about being married like it's a burden, and that there comes a point when even the funniest jokes get old, and that his jokes about his wife haven't ever been funny.

it kind of went to an awkward silence until james left for the day.  some of my coworkers are glad i called him out on it, some of them think what i said went too far.

so here?  should i apologize to james tomorrow?",3
"if i reported this woman?. i was on a call with my sister, who was giving me some usual gossip about people we know from back home, when she tells me about a family friend dina who has just recently become sexually active with her boyfriend. i asked my sister how she knew dina was sexually active, and she told me she heard it from my mom. 

i know that dina is super private and comes from a really conservative household, and wouldn't dare tell her parents about her being sexually active. i asked my sister how my mom knew, and apparently my mom's best friend, let's call her miss annie (not dina's mother) is very good friends with dina's pcp, who told her the gossip. i work in healthcare, and i feel like this has to be a hipaa violation, so i told my sister i might have to report dina's pcp. 

if i report her? my sister told me i shouldn't because ""you'll be ruining that doctor's life and her family over 'just a bit of gossip'"" (she has two small children and is in the process of moving her husband over to the us from abroad) and that i should just ""mind my own business."" my best friend (who also knows dina well) said that i don't have any proof to report her over just ""hearsay"" and ""gossip."" however this situation isn't sitting right with me.

edit: hey guys! so after heavy consideration, i scheduled a three way call between my sister, dina and i to talk about this. i'll keep you all updated! thanks for all your input everyone :)

edit 2: hi guys! sorry for the lack of update (mods turned me down) just wanted to update you all - turns out that dina did tell her doctor about it.... in confidence at a family friend's party where miss annie happened to be eavesdropping on. long story short, dina's mom had an angry conversation with miss annie and told her essentially to ""get a life"" and to ""stop gossiping about other people's children."" i'm happy i told dina first and didn't report that doctor. thanks guys!",3
"possibly over-reacting at my wife's ""mistake"" by leaving the house for a week. i know relationship posts aren't allowed here so i want to keep this focused to the incident at hand. so please don't give any relationship advice.

okay, so i am a big fan of seinfeld as i used to watch it every day after school with my dad. i had a poster that was signed by the actors who played the four main characters jerry, kramer, costanza, and elaine. this poster has always been really important to me because watching seinfield with my dad is one of the few times i got to spend time with him (he had a lot of personal issues) and he personally went and got it signed to give me for my 21st birthday. so yeah, it's not just a dumb poster to me, it has a lot of sentimental value.

now my wife and i have been trying to raise money to start a college fund for our kids. as you do, we've been selling stuff we don't need anymore, and i guess you can see where this is going. i hadn't been in my study a few weeks as i've been on an extended business trip, and when i come home to my study my poster is gone. i ask my wife where it is and she said she sold it on ebay.

here's where it gets iffy. she claims she assumed it would be okay to sell since it's just a poster, despite it being so sentimental to me. the reason i am suspect is because she was very unhappy with me going on this business trip. she tried to forbid me going because she couldn't come with me (to make sure i behave myself). however i couldn't say no, i literally had to go or i'd severely hurt my reputation at work. so when i leave we're fighting, when i come back my most prized possession is gone in a ""mistake."" see where i'm coming from?

i told my wife i was going to stay in a motel for 1-2 weeks, and that if she wants to save this marriage my poster better be back in my study when i get back. she's supposedly been an emotional wreck ever since (according to her sister).

"for pressing charges on my daughter for fraud?. me and my wife recently found out that her daughter (my step-daughter, though i consider her close enough to my own after having raised her for 18 years) has taken out about $60,000 in loan debt under our name, without our permission. for some basic context, she took out a parent plus loan for school, under our name and social security number, without asking us. in her first semester of her freshman year, she did come to us, asking if we would fill out the paperwork for her, since her school's loans were only for about $5000 for the whole year. we explained that we didn't have the financial means to take out a loan for the amount she was requesting; about $14,000 a year, but offered to help her find scholarships or work-study, and other ways to potentially help her cover her costs. after me and her applied for about 5-10 scholarships, and she got a part-time job, she never came back to me and my wife with any financial aid concerns again, so we figured that she had largely figured it up. we brought up tuition a couple times, but every time we'd ask, she'd just say that she was able to cover it all, and didn't need any help with it or anything.

come us, a couple years down the road. we've gotten a letter from the department of education saying that 'our' loan has gone into default, and has been so for about a year at this point. we reach out to her school and, after a little bit of digging, we discover that after we had told her ""no"" on the loan, she had gone around our back and applied for it all online. she filled in her own contact information instead of our own, and the loan went through just fine, since she had the correct social security numbers and all. we've spoken with the school and the doe a fair amount about this already, and we basically have 2 options for this. we can either eat the loan, and pay it all back ourselves (something not at all financially feasible for my family, since we have about $40k in medical debt on top of this now), or to go through the state to press charges on each one of the 5 loans she's taken out; each loan being over $10,000, making this a felony in my state with a minimum prison sentence. at this point, i'm not certain what my family \*can\* do. we don't have the money to be able to pay this loan back, but me and my wife are emotionally wrecked at even the thought of pressing charges against our own daughter. so, here's the important question, reddit: if i press charges here, aita?

edit: since there's a little bit of confusion, a bit of clarification. a plus loan is a loan that we would take out in our own name, to give her extra funds for education. because we would ordinarily be the ones taking it out, she's not involved with the repayment process at all; she's not even technically eligible to make payments towards it, since it's under our own name.  


edit 2: i promised myself i would never do anything stupid like this if i ever had a post blow up, but now i truly understand what rip inbox means. i really truly would like to thank everyone here for their support; i know reddit is one of the few places i can make a post and expect to get a reply.  


in reality, even though i've gotten a huge outpouring of support saying i wnbta (is that a thing? idk) if me and my wife go through with this, i'm still 100% split about how i actually want to go. you guys have given me a lot to chew on, and i'd really like to thank you all.",3
"for grounding my son for the rest of the year and forbidding him from seeing his girlfriend (or any of his friends) privately because i found out he wasn't using condoms?. two days ago, my 16 year old son came to my wife and i freaked out. he said he's scared for his life and he doesn't know what he's going to do. we had to calm him down and to make a long story short, he thinks he got his girlfriend pregnant. he said she missed her period weeks ago and he doesn't know what he's going to do because he's not ready to be a father. his girlfriend is vehemently pro-life, so there's not anything he can do.

i asked him how could this happen; why wasn't she taking her reproductive health seriously and be on birth control, and especially, why isn't he especially not taking him reproductive seriously by using condoms. he said that his girlfriend's parents are strict, so she has no way to access them, and to condoms, he said and i quote ""condoms feel like having sex with a thick garbage bag."" apparently, they relied on the calendar method and pulling out because ""together, it's almost impossible to get pregnant.""

i was **infuriated**. i've talked to him all the time about safe sex. we're no prudes; we knew that once he got a girlfriend, he'd start having sex. which is why we emphasized being *safe*. we've just have had this conversation so many times; i was just so. angry. that my son would do this to his life, and potentially wreck his entire life. 

i told him that this was his fuck-up, and he has to take responsibility. effective immediately, he is going to have to get a job and work 40 hours a week and start building a savings. additionally, he has shown that we cannot trust him to make responsible decisions, and he's effectively grounded until the end of the year. he can spend time with his friends at our house only, with all the doors open, and he cannot go upstairs with any girl at all. he can also only do this only when we're home (we live in a gated community so this is easily enforceable). that means no sleepovers, no parties, no going to the pool (unless we go with him), no nothing. if he wants to go somewhere like out to eat with his friends, we'll use find my iphone to track him. he said he understood.

he came to us today with great news; his girlfriend got her period. he asked now that she's not really pregnant, can the punishment be less strict, and that he promises to start using condoms now, but my wife and i want to stick to our guns on this. though with the added stipulation that he can work 20 hours a week instead, and it can be a mixture of volunteer and actual work. but he's shown us he's downright irresponsible and we just plainly cannot trust him until he matures. 

my son maintains that we're being way to harsh, and that he realizes his mistake now, but he's also said in the past that he'd never have sex without a condom because ""he's not an idiot."" we just plainly cannot trust him right now. are we being unreasonable?

edit: the work thing would've just been for the summer. sorry for the confusion; we agree that there's no way on earth he could manage that many hours during the school year.",3
"got a tarantula so the in-laws stop coming by. i have insufferable in laws. father in law is manageable, but mother in law is crazy.

my wife is chinese and her parents are really traditional. privacy means nothing to them, and my wife refuses to set boundaries. they will come around every day unannounced to visit my wife/play with our kids. so not only do i never get a break from my mother in laws constant nagging, i have no privacy from them.

wife has ignored my concerns for years. to be fair, she's in a tough spot as standing up to chinese parents is a pain i guess.

anyway, mother in law is arachnophobic. a few months ago she went crazy after a (wolf?) spider was simply in the corner doing nothing. panic attack and all.

so i got the idea to get a tarantula as a way to prevent her coming so often. it's in a big enclosure in the living room. asked wife before hand if it's okay, but didn't tell her the motivation. worked like a charm, the dad still comes but the mother can't stand to be in the same house as it.

i'm mainly asking if as i wasn't upfront with my wife. but she's continued to ignore my concerns about boundaries for years, i don't think i had a choice. plus the tarantula makes a cool pet.",3
"for 'forcing' my son to be a father after he got a girl pregnant?. my son is 21 years old and got a girl from work pregnant. needless to say, i am incredibly disappointed in him and when he told me i was devastated he'd make such a silly mistake. i asked him about an abortion and he broke down and told me he'd worn a condom and he was hoping she'd abort but to no avail. 

i have met the future mother of my grandchild in a very awkward meeting one day and it's clear to me she's a lovely young lady. however i found out from her (not even my coward son) that he has broken all ties with her and plans only to give child support and not see this baby at all. 

i have been texting her and trying to assuage her worries but she is also understandably worried that she won't have any support and that her baby- my first grandchild- won't have its father. obviously i am very much wanting to be in this child's life also.

of course i have been trying to speak to my son over and over about this issue and i keep telling him that the deed is done and he needs to just deal with it now. he told me in tears that he never wanted to be a father and he wore protection, as well as the fact they were casual lovers and nothing more. i told him i would withdraw all financial assistance if he wasn't in this babies life and he told me if that was the case then so be it, so i took his car and phone and bank cards that were attached to my account. 

in response to this, he's moved in with his father but i have no idea where he lives and he's not even attempted once to contact me. he told me he was leaving and that i wasn't supporting him. my own parents are vehemently against him leaving and have said they'll disown him if he doesn't come back. 

my partner of 12 years however is very much on my sons side and has told me that he's disappointed in how i'm handling this.

"for not fessing up to causing a coworkers allergic reaction?. last week one of my coworkers started to feel unwell and another coworker took her to the er. she was having an allergic reaction. she has an allergy towards peanuts and thinking back on it i probably caused the reaction since we both had had to use the same computer to check order and i had peanut butter on my waffles that morning. i definitely don't think i washed my hands after either. once somebody got the call she was ok they asked us all in a group who had had peanut butter that day and i stayed completely silent.

well, yesterday she came back into work. she was fine and everything, but apparently the trip to the er still cost her $300 after insurance plus the money she lost not going to work for a two days. our coworkers all sympathized and a few started saying whoever had the peanut butter should have to pay. since i wasn't part of that conversation. i just heard them from across the room, i just focused on my work an tried to avoid the subject for the rest of the day.

"for feeding my sons vegan friend meat?. hey guys, short time lurker first time poster, i'm not one to really do this but i'm genuinely wondering if i'm in the wrong.


so my son had a friend over for dinner the other night. for context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.


i don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables i normally cook - pretty much all i ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.


well, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. we said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. we told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.


well, that night was meatloaf night. with homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. i offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. so, we just made him the same plate as ours. 


well when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were pissed. they said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? even though it was his choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think i should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. i also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some i'm not going to say no. so what's reddit's judgement, who's in the wrong here?",3
"for not taking pictures of my wife at our wedding?. so we tied the knot and decided that after saying 'i do', 'sarah' and i would each have our own digital camera to take any photos we wanted during the rest of the day to record our own personal memories, then put these in a section of our wedding photo album. it was her idea and i thought it would be fun. 

fast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. we look through them together for the first time- to summarise:

her photos: me in my suit, me with our god daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. more of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me.

my photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen.

as soon as sarah saw the pictures i had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. i asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that i hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. i basically told her that i didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. she replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. this conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. i feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, i need to know if i'm in the wrong.

so, am i the asshole here? i... feel like she's overreacting a little. i thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. i didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her.

**edit: info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. the cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. i remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. she prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more**

**edit 2** i'm the asshole. and a clueless idiot. from now on i'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. thank you to all who have judged me, i accept my judgement",3
"for saying no when a child i didn't know asked if she could play with my sons bike.. this is literally the hot topic of the day for my entire family and i'm fed up of being called an asshole so i'm going to ask on here. 

we are on a family vacation at the moment and we had gone to a park where there were a lot of young families like my own. my 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. they were pretty close by. 

my son is obsessed with his bike and loves it. he had been playing on it for a while, and the other family had a little girl his age that kept looking over. 

when we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. my mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blase attitude towards belongings and she's lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn't attached to material things.

i interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl 'why don't you ask (my son) since it's his bike?' she did and my son said no. she looked a little crestfallen but went back to her family and she didn't seem bothered afterwards. 

my entire family looked at my like i was an evil witch and even my own husbands facial expression was surprised at me. 

i got a little defensive and told them that it was our sons toy to lend out as he pleased, and i was a little irritated to hear my mom say to my son 'honey, sometimes it's nice to share' because he looked upset afterwards. l know that, he knows that, but it's his new toy and he shouldn't be made to feel bad over not wanting to share with a total stranger.

"for stealing my friends bird. i love birds, and i'm the proud owner of 2 budgies. i've had them for about a year and a half. when i first got them, my friend fell in love decided she wanted one of her own.

she then proceeded to spend the least amount of money she could on a cage and decorated it with minimal accessories. she got the bird, and while she seemed to like it at first, she basically ignored it after a month. 

every time i went over to her house, i told her that it needed more attention. it just sat in the corner all day, silent, occasionally gnawing at the only toy in the cage, which was shredded and worn within the first couple of months. its food and water were probably only changed once a week. it was living above a mountain of poop because she never changed the tray.

i told her repeatedly that she was neglecting her bird. and despite promising to do better, she never did. 

i asked her if i could have it. she got really upset with me, saying that she had paid for it so she had the right to do what she wanted with it. 

i felt really horrible every time i went over there. i decided i wanted to steal it. i felt like i could give it a better life. it could even make friends with my 2 birds. i just couldn't let it live the rest of its life unhappy in the corner of a cage, doing nothing. 

so i did it. she was in the bathroom, and i took a shoe box i had hidden in my backpack and got the bird in. it was scared at first, but it calmed down in the box. i left without even saying goodbye. 

soon after i got a phone call which basically consisted of her yelling at me for a long while. i said that i'd give back her bird if she bought it a bigger cage, more toys, and promised to take better care of it. she once again used the argument of, ""its my bird, i can do what i want with it.""

i took it home, where it livened up in the presence of my 2 other birds. it began chirping for the first time i had ever heard. it seemed very happy. 

this was all 3 days ago. my friend is still extremely pissed at me for not giving her bird back and is saying i'm being an asshole. so reddit, aita?

update: wow, i was not expecting this to get so huge. 

i honestly went into this thinking i was going to keep the bird for probably 1 day or something before she profusely apologized and vowed to change her ways. she didn't. like i said, i would have given it back if she had. 

i guess i just figured that she needed something drastic to snap her into the reality that she was neglecting her bird. which now, after reading the comments, i understand was a pretty immature way of handling things. 

today i offered her $50 as reimbursement, which was double what she bought the bird for. she took it and is letting me keep the bird. but she still hates me. honestly, at this point, i couldn't care less. the bird is safe. that's all that matters.

i think i could've handled it better, but i don't regret my choices. thanks for the advice, support, and reality checks, everyone.",3
"for excluding my blind friend from my wedding?. i have a friend, bobby (not his real name), who struggles with his eyesight. he's quite quiet and solemn most of the time, but he's a solid guy and he's good to spend time with. we met at college a couple of years ago and have taken tons of classes together. first year we lived together, and have stayed friends since i moved out. after the first couple of weeks of knowing him, it emerged that he was registered blind. he's not completely without his sight so it's not like we didn't notice this guy with a cane and a dog, it's just that he needs mega sized text to read, and he's not allowed to drive or get his license. he's completely independent though, and has a free public transport card to get the bus and train since he can't drive. he's always been a bit of a home bird as well, so every weekend he'd travel  about 2 hours back up home, and 2 hours back, so that he could visit his mum and dad.


now my fiance and i have been dating for over 4 years and have been engaged for 18 months. as is the way with weddings, we sent out save the dates and invites along the way, and bobby received both. because i'm not a very organised human, the wedding invites went out a little later than they traditionally might, but since everyone who was coming knew about the wedding in advance, and received a save the date, it was fine. we had a few people who missed the rsvp date by a couple of days but no harm no foul in my eyes. the rsvp date was set for exactly one month before the wedding.

bobby also missed the rsvp date. he wasn't the only one i had to chase up a week later, but he was the only one who read the message and then took two further days to reply with a yes. today, less than two weeks before the wedding, he's messaged saying he can only come to the wedding if he can have a plus one. the reason for his plus one is his eyesight. because he doesn't drive and he's not local he needs someone, his mum, to be present to drive him there and back. i flat out told him no, he's not inviting his mum as a plus one because we've already told the hotel the number for the meal, but she's welcome at the rest of the day. 
the hotel in reality doesn't need the numbers up till 48 hours before, but the table plans are set, there's no easy space to slot her in, and i don't want a friends mum that nobody knows enjoying the wedding meal and speeches, and us paying for the privilege. i now doubt whether he'll come, because i don't know if she's happy coming all the way, to not even be fed.


am i the asshole?




*edit:* a few things to update here. i've been chatting to the friend more. despite what you all think, i do actually care and the nuances of how much a person can see can't be put across in a post. the mother is welcome at the full day, except the meal. and by the tone of bobbys message, it wasn't bobby asking for his mum to be there, but bobbys overprotective mum asking that she attend. ceremony and evening do is fine, and i told bobby as much when he first messaged yesterday. i've since reached out and offered to pay for the mum at the second restaurant that's on site.

additionally, something of note is that my family are all not local. it's either a flight or a ferry for them to get to the wedding, and to cater for both my family and other guests who can't/won't drive, we hired a bus for a city centre pick-up. the bus takes people down to the church, then back to the reception venue. it's only getting home again that people need to manage themselves, but various people are staying in the same hotel that the reception is at. travel arrangements have been a big part of the wedding, and bobby has been invited to use them from the start.

to those saying he needs eyes for the evening. i'm not disagreeing with you to be flippant of his needs, or to be callous, even if i am still an asshole. i'm saying having known him for 2 years, he doesn't need his mother there. there are plenty of college friends there, who he's seated with, who can help him find his seat or point out the loos. it's a group of friends and we've all been there to support him when necessary (which is genuinely rare, because as i said, he is *fully* independent, even in new environments).

i can live with being judged an asshole, but felt there was more information available that was affecting my decision, that wasn't available to the jury.",3
"update aita, i flew 1k miles to visit a girl, arrived here and saw another guy has also come to see her but i don't want her to spend any time with him. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cn59tp/aita_i_flew_1k_miles_to_visit_a_girl_arrived_here/?st=jzismolp&sh=acd7fa42

i got home a few days ago and wanted to give everyone an update. the rest of the week was pretty much the three of us again, except for one other night where we were alone. so essentially in a week we only had two nights out together (i slept in her house so we spent nights alone anyway but i mean going out alone without third wheel).

i decided to do what a lot of you were suggesting and i confronted the other guy about wtf was going on. i guess something didn't feel right and my gut was telling me i should probably talk to him because i felt she was lying. so i went out on a ""walk to the shops"" and ended up at the guy's hotel and room.

straight up asked him what's going on, it was incredibly awkward but we ended up having a good conversation about her and he basically was told the same as i was. except she lied and said i purposely told her i couldn't afford a room and she ""had to offer me her place"". this isn't true, she offered me her place from the get-go and i never insinuated i wouldn't get a hotel room. she told him she liked him, was incredibly flirtatious with him too and they actually took it much farther than we did. they had a lot of phone sex, he had her nudes (he didn't show me out of respect for her), and they cammed a lot. a lot more than she did with me. i felt heartbroken, still do but i'm feeling better. on this trip alone they actually had sex when she was at his room, he confirmed it with a text she sent him when she left to go out with me. he does really like her, i'm not sure if she likes him back but she did sleep with him so maybe, she never did strike me as that type of person yet here we are, i told him he could have her.

so yeah. in essence, she lied a lot. she told me she really liked me, told him she doesn't like me at all. was incredibly flirty with both of us and leading us both on. she told him she didn't want me at her house yet totally invited me to stay there. she told me she didn't like him, he's just a friend visiting, but then turns out she's had a sexual relationship with him for months and they even slept together while i was also there. it's shit.

shit update and it's 100% what you lot expected and were telling me was gonna happen. turns out i am really fucking stupid however i'm working on it and you can bet i won't make the same mistake again.

"for skipping my own wedding to see my dying grandma?. this actually happened about 5 months ago, but since my girlfriend (no longer engaged) refuses to let it go, and i honestly don't think i'm in the wrong, i figured i'd ask for an outside opinion.

my girlfriend (then fiancee) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago. 

now, my biological mother is a useless drug addict that i've never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. she left me with my grandma and i was raised by her since birth. i have always and will always consider my grandma my real ""mother""  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.

about a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. this was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn't have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer's help. she had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. 

fast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma's condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. my uncles and i immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. 

she doesn't pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. i called my fiancee multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. not only was i not in the best state of mind (again, she's my mother to me) but i needed to be by her side when she passed. i felt sick at the idea of not being there when i could.

my fiancee was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted i get ready as soon as possible. she obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and i understand that it definitely sucks. she also said there was no point in me being there since she won't even know i'm there due to her dementia. i understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn't matter if she realised i was there or not. i just felt i had to be there with my uncles. 

she ended up passing the night of my wedding. my fiancee didn't talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. she said i was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. she thinks that as my fiancee she should take top priority no matter what. my opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with my grandma when she passed was more important.

so yeah that's the back story. we have both agreed to go with the majority judgement given here and move on from it. will answer questions when possible but will refrain from defending myself in order to be fair to my gf.",3
"for exposing my late wife to my sons?. please bear with me while i try to gather my thoughts and explain just what's going on. i (m40)was married to my wife (f38) for 18 years. we had what i thought was a perfect relationship, we barely fought, got along great, and she was my best friend. we had two sons together, j who is 14 and m who is 16. 

my wife passed extremely unexpectedly a month ago and it absolutely shattered our world. i feel so alone and have even started going to counseling to help with getting over her. 

here is the hard part. two nights ago i decided to go through my wife's cell phone to read our text messages and look at some photos she had taken i never got sent. that's when i found the messages after i decided to look through her browser history. 

messages to men in their 60's sending dirty photos she had sent me. nights she told me she was visiting her sister, she was actually out with these men doing god knows what for money. i don't want to get into to much detail with how filthy some of they were, but i cannot believe she could have done this to me. i suspected nothing. ever. 

my sons are obviously still crushed and always talking up their mother and how sweet, amazing she is. how much they miss her love and honesty. i cannot see her as the woman i thought i knew and i am torn on what to do. on one hand, i don't want to make this passing harder for them and hinder their thoughts about their mother but on another hand i feel they are old enough to know the truth. 

if i exposed my late wife to my sons and told them what she was really doing to our family? please help me.


edit: wow. thanks for all the feedback. i never knew that me losing a best friend, wife and mother of my children would end with me being berated. this post didn't come from malicious intent to hurt my children, and i apologize if it came out that way. i asked because i truly don't know. i feel that i would have wanted to know who my mother was fully but i can see why so many disagree. 
this is something that i will keep to myself for now- and if my children ever inquire further that's something i will deal with along the way. 

to all the ones who were kind, thank you. and to those calling me a selfish piece of shit i hope you are never put in my position. thank you.

last edit: it's now been about 24 hours since my post- which i never thought would get front page- and i want to thank everyone who has reached out to me. i understand that 'exposing' was a very poor word choice and came across the wrong way. i'm still trying to message everyone back who has privately reached out. 
as i said earlier, this will be something i keep to myself and have a talk about truth with my sons down the road. i'm meeting with her family today to figure out what to do about her things and what else. i'm also looking into therapists for my sons today like many of you have mentioned.",3
"for calling the police on my kid?. daughter is 16. her mom and i are divorced.daughter has been caught smoking pot several times from the age of 14. her mom and i have collectively punished her several times for this. the last time we caught her, i started drug testing her. her mom doesn't agree with it, but we have caught her so many times now that i think this is the best way to prevent her from doing it.

i don't normally go through her room, but the router for the house is in there, and i needed to reset it. when i go into her room, i found a mushroom cap on black paper hidden underneath her desk. i look up what the hell it is and it is a spore print for magic mushrooms. i go through her room further to find an entire damn aqarium filled with mushrooms in the back of her closet. obviously i am enraged, so i wait for her to get back from school, and i called the police. she was arrested, booked and released into her mother's custody.

her mother is pissed, and saying that i may have ruined the kids life for no reason, but we have tried to correct her drug abuse several times to no avail, and it has escalated. she now has a court date and can answer to the law since she doesn't take the rules in my house seriously. i doubt she'll get more than probation anyway.

my parents are also pissed though, saying that this could have been handled inside the home, and that's why i'm here. i'm wondering if i over reacted and would like a more impartial judgment.

i am making and edit to respond to a few things.

this was a small ten gallon tank. i guess people are picturing something larger. there were a lot of mushrooms in there though. my daughter has a small walk in closet that is, honestly, so messy that i don't bother to look in there too much. because she has been passing her drug tests, i have been cutting her slack. i honestly would not have called the police if i thought that she was going to get a jail sentence at all.",3
"for never telling my son about the existance of his twin brother. my 4 year old son jon is the one of the twins i had. my other son was mishandled by a nurse and passed away shortly after birth, it was an unfortunate accident. 


me and my husband left our unnamed son with the hospital and did not press charges against the nurse, much to our parents'(both his and mine) displeasure. our reason was that we had no time nor energy to deal with them, our priority was to look after jon, who was much smaller than his twin and needed more attention.


while growing up, despite never being mentioned, jon seemed to know that he once had a brother. he told us his made-up stories that he had about brothers, he played roles about brothers with his toys, and he even asked us to give him an older brother.


initially, me and my husband made a promise that we would never tell jon about his unnamed brother, but now he wants to tell jon about it when he is older. it must have been the guilt that we have never acknowledged our unnamed son's existence, even though they are both our sons. 


i am still still standing firm to our promise. i believe that we should not dwell on the past and move on. jon is my son and my little bundle of joy, i would never want him to know the sorrow of losing his brother. i want to convince him that his brother is just a fragment of his imagination.


now both my parents, my husband's parents and my husband is calling me cold blooded. they want so much to included a deceased brother into jon's life. he is still little, so it wouldn't be now, but they intended to tell him one day and i cannot stop them. however, i will still try to convince them while there is  time, he needs no such negativity from the past.

"for telling my sister a ""wedding tattoo"" is a curse (even though i have one), and now the curse is coming true?. my partner and i are in our 30s and we live in a country where gay marriage is illegal. we got engaged years ago knowing we wouldn't be able to marry, but we set a ""wedding"" date and had a party for friends and family. instead of an actual ceremony, we got matching tattoos. we had been together 7 years when that happened, and it's been another 6 years since then.

anyway, my sister has been with her husband for just under 2 years. they got engaged almost as soon as they started dating, and they married 3 months ago. however, they're both not into wearing rings, so my sister suggested to her husband to get tattoos instead.

i jokingly told her that it's a curse (that getting a tattoo of a boyfriend/husband/partner's name will result in a break-up) and she said that my relationship is still going strong despite the curse. i said yeah, but we were together for 7 years when we got the tattoos, and btw we didn't tattoo each other's names but something else (a picture of a memory we have together), whereas she was going for straight-up ""samuel <3 21.6.19"" in huge thick letters across her wrist. i told her not to do it, and to just wear her wedding band on a necklace or something, but she told me to piss off, and did it anyway.

fast forward, her marriage is falling apart. nothing happened, they just seem to be realizing they're not a good fit, and it's only a question of time when they'll divorce. they don't even live together anymore, he moved out 3 weeks into their marriage.

now, my sister is blaming me for subconsciously influencing her and making her marriage fail. she thinks that me saying it was a curse subconsciously made her act towards her husband in a certain way that resulted in him being pushed away and not loving her anymore. i've never heard of something like this before. i very much doubt i have this superpower of destroying relationships. but my sister is currently going around telling our relatives i'm the asshole that ruined her marriage.

"for excluding one of my girlfriends from girls' night out after he came out as transgender?.   first off it's not my intent to misgender but this is new to me so excuse me. one of my friends recently came out as trans and said she always felt like a guy trapped inside a woman's body.



  she has started transitioning & wearing male clothing and wants us to start referring to her using male pronouns instead of female. i have no problem with him being transgender however my other girlfriends and i don't feel comfortable including him in our night outs once he's done transitioning.



   we don't feel it's appropriate anymore because it's, well, girls' night out. i mentioned this to my bf and he says it's transphobic to exclude him but we don't feel comfortable with him anymore and i think our feelings overtake his. plus in my defense if excluding him is transphobic then girls' night outs are sexist because they exclude men. i don't think we're doing anything wrong because my safety overtakes his feelings. aita?",3
"for reporting a theft a young man committed, he lost his scholarship and admission to university. i own a liquor store in the suburbs. overall the area is decently safe, especially compared to the city.

"for telling my coworker about the reality of a 478 mcat score. the mcat is basically the entrance exam for medical schools in the us. applicants are graded from 472 to 528 based on a percentile. a 478 is literally the bottom 2% of test takers. the median/average score that can maybe get you into a med school is a 500. you must score at least a 508 to be in the top 20% of applicants, in a field where only about 20% of applicants each year accepted into all the med schools in the country.

results for the june 15 exam came out yesterday. this coworker was happily telling people how she passed and got a 478. i myself aspire to be a doctor but postponed taking the mcat because i have been unable to hit a 505 consistently in full length practice tests. i have an trying to coach her, telling her that she must hit at least a 500 to be even considered as a serious applicant. throughout this process, i have noticed that she didn't have a solid prep plan, or a good idea of how to be a pre-med student (she is non traditional like me).

so when she was happily telling our other coworkers (and the doctors we work for!) that she got a 478, i took her aside and tried to explain to her the reality of the situation as nicely as possible. threw in some encouraging words about the virtues of retaking, implored her to hit the kaplan books and really research the kinds of students the schools she wants to apply to (she just wants to get in anywhere).  i asked her to reconsider postponing her applications until next year. she had already sent out some primaries but haven't gotten any secondary applications back.

they've lived together for the last year and therefore she lives with my son half the time. my ex works very long hours and it's clear from what my son tells me that my ex's girlfriend takes care of him almost exclusively during the week because my ex is working.

"for telling the guy my fiance left me for how our relationship ended?. this happened a couple years ago but some of our mutual friends still think i was the dick in this situation, so i thought i would submit myself to judgement.

i was living with and discussing marriage with a girl i'd been dating for around 3 years.  she went off on a school trip around the end of february/beginning of march  and when she came back,  things seemed off.  it was just little things, like she started texting ""luv ya"" instead of ""love you"" and stuff like that.  i finally asked her what the deal was around the end of april, and we ended up ""taking a break"". i moved out, but we still hung out almost every day, still went on dates, still had sex. 

i had bought her a new cell phone around the time she got back, an lg v10 (believe it or not this is important). around the end of may or so, the phone malfunctions and bootloops endlessly, as they are known to do.  she gives it to me so i can try to warranty it or something to get some of my money back, while she buys herself a new phone.  i did some research and discovered that the bootloop could be temporarily bypassed by freezing the phone, so i decide to give it a shot so i can try to pull her pictures and stuff off and generally just try to win some good guy points.  it works, and as soon as i boot it up she starts getting messages from ""david"". lots of messages, of the not so innocent variety. 

i pop open the messages to see that they go back all the way to her school trip. she's been seeing this guy in secret for months, both before and after our ""break"" while also giving me the runaround and acting like we're on the verge of getting back together.  it's also clear that he doesn't know about me at all, every time he tries to make plans with her while we were doing somrthing, she was just making excuses like ""spending time with family"". 

i shoot him a few texts, tell him who i am,  that i just discovered i was being lied to, and that i suspected he was being lied to as well.  turns out he was recently divorced because his wife had been cheating, and he was horrified to discover that he had been the ""other guy"".  long story short, we both washed our hands of her and went our separate ways, but literally every female i know has told me that it was not my place to tell him and that i should have left well enough alone.  i even had to leave my job because the women there ostracized me so heavily because of it.  the way i see it, he deserved the truth and i helped him dodge a major bullet before it could hurt him like it hurt me.  clearly she was the asshole for cheating, but am i the asshole for exposing it?

edit to answer some common questions:

>why did you tell everybody?

i didn't.  i told one person at work, because i thought they were my friend, and who doesn't need a friend to talk to when shit like that goes down?  that one person told everyone else in the office.  we also lived in a really small town at the time, and gossipers gonna gossip.

>why are you calling her your fiancee when it sounds like you never proposed?

when i said we discussed marriage, i meant that we had sat down and decided that we were getting marries. plans were already in the works and a date had already been set.  i've always believed that a step that big should come from mutual agreement rather than springing it on someone and putting them on the spot for an answer. maybe i'm wrong.

>what did you do to make her cheat on you?

well, to paraphrase her reasoning, we had been together for a while and the relationship wasn't ""new and exciting"" anymore. she met a dude that made her feel the new and exciting feelings again so she decided to fuck him. also, fuck you for asking that.",3
"for ditching my cousin's baby shower and taking the food away from the party?. update: my dad heard the whole thing and told my mother about it, who was working in the kitchen. they both (politely) excused themselves afterwards and drove over to my place to talk about it. my dad drove my half of the groceries to my cousin's place and then came back. there's now a massive feud on our family whatsapp with two groups:

1) family who are sticking up for me and telling other people to stop provoking me (mostly older relatives).

2) people who are saying i'm an asshole (mostly the younger generation).

&#x200b;

my cousin and her boyfriend (soon-to-be-married) were having their baby shower and the whole family was invited to the party. my mother and aunts love to cook so they wanted to gather the ingredients and make a huge dinner themselves. i drove my car and my father drove his, and we basically pushed the shopping carts along and got our credit cards ready while the women shoveled everything they wanted into the carriages.

we finally got everything to my cousin's place and we started off-loading my dad's car first. while i was inside, i got a chance to say hi to my cousin to congratulate her on her baby shower. the conversation started off light, but took a weird turn. she asked me how my parents raised me, and specific details like if they grounded me, what kinds of punishment they used, what i did when i was little and what regrets i had as a kid that i would change. i thought they were trying to learn how to raise their child, but it was weird because i'm a single guy. they would've been better off asking my parents about these things.

here's where things get dark. i ask my cousin why she's asking me all this, and she says, ""i just want to raise my baby better than you,"" that made no sense because i never raised any babies. the vibe i got was definitely that it was an insult but on the off-chance she wasn't intentionally being rude, i just laughed it off and said, ""well i'm no bill gates, or steve jobs, but i do alright for,"" i assumed she meant that she wanted to raise her baby to be better than me, which is fine since parents want the world for their kids.

nope, she just kept going. ""well that's true. did your parents ever think you'd turn out this way?""

i said, ""well i think they just wanted me to be happy,""

her, ""are you?""

me, ""well i'm definitely happy for you, congratulations!"" (i'm trying reaaaaaaally hard to steer things away from me).

her, ""thanks. do you ever plan on having kids?""

me, ""i just gotta find the right person, but until then i'm gonna enjoy life as is. there's no need to stress out wanting something else and taking what we have for granted.""

her, ""sure... well i'm younger than you and i already have a family. don't wait too long... or else you might ending up dying alone,"" i ask her directly what she meant. she just laughs, shrugs, and leaves. i her again and she says, ""don't get angry at me, you're the one who refuses to go out and meet people. if you bothered to leave your house every once in a while maybe you'd have a family of your own by now. i just don't want my baby to end up like you,""

everyone within earshot was dead-silent. i just stared at her for who knows how long and she just ends up rubbing her belly and waddling away.

i leave, taking my car home and halfway there, i realize half the groceries are still in my car. at this point, i could have driven back and dumped it on the porch buuuuuuuuuuuut i decided fuck it, screw her. i ignored all calls and texts, and just took a nap.",3
"for telling a stem major to shut the fuck up?. so i have finals this week and, tensions are running high everywhere. i was studying in the library with a group of friends for a political science class, and my friend complained that this class is incredibly hard and he's having a tough time. this girl who was studying with us heard him and was like ""you aren't a stem major so why are you even complaining? you haven't had a hard class till you've taken calc 3."" now i'm not a stem major either, and i just felt tired of always being told my major isn't hard or anything, especially since she has mentioned it several times before, so i told her to shut the fuck up for once. but this led to her crying and her friends started telling me i was being mean to her.

"if i report my son's school?. okay, so at my son's school they have a system where kids get points for good behavior and negative marks for behavior that needs work. there is an app where parents can view this as well as communicate with teachers. 

my son's grade (1st) was having an end of the year good behavior field trip to a skating rink. the kids that could go had to have so many good behavior points. my son was diagnosed with adhd and we are working on ways to help him control his energy and to behave better. that said, he was about 5 points shy of being able to go on the field trip. because of that i did not send in a signed permission slip or money. 

the day of the field trip comes around and k send my son to school expecting him to have to go to another class room for the day. after school i pick him up and ask how his day was and he proceeds to tell me that they took him with them on the field trip. he said he was told to sit at a table on the side of the skating rink and to do a work packet while watching the other kids. 

he was upset because he was made to sit and watch everyone else having fun. that is understandable because these kids are 7 years old. yes he understands consequences for bad behavior but what adult thinks this is a good consequence? so since it was after school, i messaged his teacher asking about it. i have not gotten a reply. i tried calling the principal and was unable to reach her. 

so i would like to know for calling the school board or whoever i need to call and reporting the school? i'm not talking about just reporting because they did a messed up, hurtful punishment but also because i was not made aware my son would be driven from the school for that day.",3
"for wanting to abort my late husband's baby?. my husband died a week ago and i'm 13 weeks pregnant. my in-laws know and they want me to keep the baby so there's a piece of him alive. when i mentioned i might get an abortion they flipped out on me, called me every name in the book and selfish, at which point i broke down in tears and left.

i don't know what to do. on one hand i can understand what they mean, if i abort there's nothing of my husband left. but i just... don't know. i can end this chapter of my life and move on. i don't know what to do. i know a lot of you are thinking it's amazing i'm pregnant and i can always have a piece of him through my baby but that's the thing, i can't decide if i want that or not. i've never been more conflicted in my life and i have to stop thinking about it so i don't miscarry from the stress.

edit: i don't know how many people will see this but i want to thank everyone who offered support and shared their stories with me via pm, i'm truly moved. i'm still undecided on what to do moving forward but i i'll try and find someone to talk to. some more context if anyone's wondering:

*  my husband died by suicide because he was too stressed out about his career. no one really saw it coming.
*  i don't have any children, or family. my sister is the only one i know and she's on the other coast. i'm 25.
*  i don't know if i'm going to abort, however *if* i do carry the baby full term, i'd rather take care of it myself and not give it up for adoption.
*  i'm in new york which has some of the toughest grandparent rights laws which further complicates things. i'm afraid of giving birth then having custody taking away from me.
*  my financial situation is... okay. i can support my baby and i if i budget down.
*  my relationship with my in-laws was never friendly. they didn't approve of me and despite trying to warm relations with them they never reciprocated.
*  some people are questioning why i'm trying to move on so fast and saying i'm awful for it: the baby is growing and i can't hit pause. i need to make up my mind sooner than later.

  my mind still isn't made up and likely won't be soon. i'll take some time off to think and talk to someone about this situation. also to the very colorful pm's telling me to kill myself, go fuck yourself. thank you.

&#x200b;

i've got a couple requests for an update, and to be honest i could have given an update the night after it happened but i didn't want to post too much if something changed. i'm sorry for ducking out of the thread early too. i read the first 400 or so comments and wanted to respond and give information to some of the folks asking, but i didn't really have time since she found the thread. i tried to obfuscate enough details that this wouldn't happen, but it's a unique situation and it got pretty popular and i think one of her friends clued her in.  i hope no other new pet parents had to explain this thread to their sos.

&#x200b;

some of you were asking for specific instances of abuse, and to be honest i didn't really think she was abusing him. i just thought that the way she was interacting with him might be more suitable for another cat. molly did wonderfully with our previous cat, but she was a different cat.

&#x200b;

my original plan was to sit down with her and try to have one more honest conversation about our cat's comfort level in this house. something needed to be done before he turned into a nervous wreck. none of this happened sadly. she came home and had it out with me about everything from the cat to some issues with her family and circled back around to our previous cat, who she kind of accused me of killing (she had end-stage cancer and stopped eating and was having daily seizures. the vet encouraged us to put her to sleep). i'd rather not go into too much detail here, but you guys were right. our relationship had a lot of problems and adopting our cat just made them undeniable. i know some people accused my post of validation-seeking, but honestly it's difficult to tell things are bad when you're looking at the situation from the inside. even if it was my fault, it's obviously time for things to end.

"- parents lost all my uni work two days before my deadline. this is literally happening right now and i'm not sure how i feel or if i'm being an arsehole here, i'm feeling many emotions right now...

for some context, i had a university deadline last friday, and another university application deadline this friday.

when i moved out a few years ago my parents insisted on keeping all my college and university so they could keep it safe, i thought fair enough, they have a much bigger house and the space available to keep everything in one place and safe. since then, extensive clearing out has occurred at my parents house.

fast forward to last month and i let my mum know that i would be needing my sketchbooks from my uni work in order to apply onto master programmes. i keep mentioning it and she keeps saying she'll get dad to look in the attic for them. this sunday comes round, i go over to pick them up and no one has looked for them yet. 


last night they let me know that they can't find anything. they've found my brothers stuff and a lot of scrappy stuff but nothing that resembles three years of university work...


long story short, my parents have basically lost my uni work, my application to these other universities is now compromised, mum is saying i need to sort this out myself now as she thinks i've given them a hard time

am i the asshole?


edit 1: thankyou to everyone who had commented, i will include a bit more info below as i've seen a few re-occuring comments.

1. i don't live at home, and i contacted my parents a month prior to the deadline, and kept reminding until i could get home. 

2. when at home i had searched the house with no luck, my parents said they had put everything in the attic for safe keeping - the attic doesn't have a drop down ladder and unless you're over 6ft like my dad, it's impossible to get inside. my work was apparently somewhere i could not physically get to. 

3. im an architecture student, and whilst i do have digital presentation sheets, the emphasis of the interview is sketchbooks, hand drawn sheets and models - which i found trashed in the attic (the models). 

4. my parents have not apologised or spoken to me since wednesday and my deadline is today. 

5. my portfolio was planned out way before the deadline, i had the sheets on photoshop set up with all the titles and annotations, all i needed was my sketchbooks, models and larger drawings to take to a plotter (i had an appointment booked) to scan and import.",3
"if i stopped inviting my triggered friend to movie night?. tdlr at the bottom

every couple of weeks me (f24) and my friends get together for a ""classic movie night"" at my house. we drink, joke around, and watch old movies deemed to be ""important to film"". good times.

the problem: one friend (23f) has been through an awful trauma recently which has affected her profoundly. our group has really huddled around her to make sure she is okay and lend our support any way we can... but... in the last few times we got together she got triggered by the graphic scenes in the films we were watching and politely asks that we stop. (the first time was rosemary's baby and the second was taxi driver, if that matters.)

of course we all wanted to be sensitive so both times we immedietly turned it off and the group quickly dispersed after (kind of a bummer). independantly, friends from the group have asked that i not invite her the next time, because we want to watch clockwork orange which will definetly be triggering to her. since i'm hosting, it is up to me, but since i usually invite everyone via a group chat that she is in, it would require some maneuvering to exclude her.

god i feel like such a dick but my friends and i really want to be free to watch what we want without worrying about making her uncomfortable. if i went out of my way to not invite her?

tldr: my friends and i want to watch movies that our traumatized friend may find triggering - to just not invite her anymore?

edit: wow. so it took just 45min for me to realize im an asshole! some smart commenter posted an obvious solution: i will be using https://www.unconsentingmedia.org/ from now on to vet our films before movie night.

"for wanting a divorce from husband who lost 200k on bitcoin?. &#x200b;

my husband and i have been married for 10 years. for our entire relationship, i have brought the majority of the money into the home. i contribute 75% of that. i don't mind, really. it's not something i think about and i have always considered it ""our"" money. our country (switzerland) is really expensive and i grew up not in a large city, and rather poor. when i had the chance to go to university, i studied hard, learned 3 languages, got 2 degrees, and was able to secure a good position in finance. years later, i make a very good salary and we don't have to worry about money.

we decided that my husband would handle all of the money and finances for the home. i would check on the accounts every once in a while but, i haven't been checking regularly. a few weeks ago, i was thinking about buying a model 3, since it has recently come to our country and i've fancied it for some time. i played with the numbers and while figuring out if i can afford it or not, i realized that there was a weird mistake in our accounts. there was 300k chf/usd missing.

when my husband got home, i showed him the accounts and after some pushing, he admitted that he lost 200k in cryptocurrency in 2018. this is about 25% of our savings. besides being shocked and angry, i cannot help to feel that he stole from me. he put money into something stupid without talking to me and then tried to hide it. i was thinking about this for a week and talked to my friends and family about it. they think we should see a doctor and talk about it, try to work out the problem. but i honestly just want to get divorced. if he is capable of doing this, how can i trust him ever again? for not wanting to talk about it or go to therapy? for thinking about divorce?

&#x200b;

edit: to clear a few things. we always talked about where the money should go. what things to invest in, etc. i always thought he was really open about it and i trusted him... because he is my husband. i work in finance but, my husband knows just as much about personal finances as i do. after going to work every day, making more decisions about money when i came home wasn't something i wanted to do. that's why i wasn't involved but, that was a mistake. also, he sold all of the bitcoin for a 200k loss. i don't think that was clear above. so we are not going to buy more and hope for the best like some suggested.

edit: if he had doubled our money or ""won"" in some way, would i be feeling the same way? partially. i would be angry for him not talking about this with me. this is a large sum, too large not to discuss. i would be happy because i would have more money. who wouldn't be happy if they had more money in their home accounts? but i would have stepped in and taken control of everything because i see all of this as gambling and that's not what i would like to do with money.",3
"for locking a kid in the bathroom?. i(26f) am single and currently living in an apartment with my cat. next door lives what looks like a single mother(40+-) and her son(8). i work early shifts, so i am usually home in the afternoons and would spend the rest of the day playing video games or painting.

the mother next door sometimes would drop her son by my door and ask me to look after him as she goes out, she would usually pick him up a few hours later. i am actually quite reluctant to help but consider that they may be in difficult situations i just suck it up. it's not like i have to babysit or entertain him, just letting him play my video games for a few hours and that's all. the son sometimes makes a mess by rummaging through my things but i could handle that by telling him off and tidy them up later. 

it was another one of the days when i let the son in and left him be. for a while everything seemed to be fine, until i realized that my cat was missing. i looked everywhere but she was nowhere to be seen. i then turned to the kid and asked if he had anything to do with it, but he was busy with his game and brushed me off impatiently. some time later, i found my terrified cat in the freezer.

i confronted the kid and demanded to know why he did that? he swore to god that he had nothing to do with it at first, then changed his words and said that the cat jumped in when he took some ice for his drinks. i then ignored his protests and locked him in the bathroom for the rest of his stay till his mother came to pick him up.

not surprisingly the mother was furious about how i treated her son. i told her that i did it for the safety of my cat because i found her precious kid trying to kill her. she argued that i could have locked up my cat instead, in which i replied that i had no obligation looking after her son in the first place. she threatened to press charges against me before storming away with her son. 

i shared this with my friends and while some said i should have rejected them a long time ago, others said i went too far. what do you think?


edit: i need to point out that the agreement to ""look after"" the kid was that i only needed to allow him inside and play video games and he stays till his mother returns. i am no ""babysitter"" and i made it clear to the mother, in which she agreed to it and still asked for my help.

"for mocking a girl with a height requirement?. backstory, im 19, 6ft1 and i use tinder frequently. i also used to be really short, like up until 17 i was sub 5ft7 and got rejected because of my height more than once. anyway, i matched with this girl sandy on tinder and we started talking a bit. a few messages in she asked me how tall i was, and i pretty much instantly knew where this was going. i checked her bio and sure enough, some stupid ""5ft10+ only"" bullshit was there. anyway, i said 6ft1, and she seemed pleased. 

then i asked her how tall she was, sure enough, she was only about 5ft2, to which i basically replied mocking her for going after tall guys, and i called her a ""picky midget"", which maybe was a bit out of line. anyway, i started goofing on her, making a bunch of jokes about footstools, and calling her out for having those preferences. also, she isn't the thinnest girl around, not fat or whatever, but anyway, i jokingly asked her what a fat girl was doing using numbers as dealbreakers, and she called me an asshole and unmatched.

"for keeping a gift solely for my son rather than splitting it between him and my girlfriend's kids?. i've been with my girlfriend for four years now.  i have a son from a previous relationship and she has two children of her own from her's.  my son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  her children are 12 and 14.  

pretty much since my son was born i've put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  when i first started i was never able to add much to it, but i worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what i could.  it now has over $40k in it.  i've been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  still i'm proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  i've daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  

my girlfriend knew about the account. there have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  she was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   now that my son will soon be graduating however we've come to a point where we are unable move past.   she doesn't want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. 

we are a great team usually.  it's almost unheard of for us not to be able to work through issues and come to an agreement so this is sort of new territory for us as neither is willing to budge on this issue so far.  she's fighting dirty too, she's been making it out as if i don't really love her children. at least not as much as my son.  i do love her kids.  that's not in question, but the truth is of course i love my son more.  i feel like that shouldn't even be that controversial of a thought.  i truly doubt she loves my son as much as her own children even if she'd never admit it. 

i honestly don't even know if i would be able to split it up even if i chose too.  this is been something i broke my back over and gave up things for myself for for almost 18 years now.  even thinking about splitting it up is difficult for me.  inside there's just a big ""no"" feeling that comes up when i try to consider it. 

i also feel like it's really shitty for my girlfriend to make this such a demand.  putting this money aside was never easy and she had no part in that.  in fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which i now help pay off) and i don't particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money. 

neither of us have been backing down and it won't be too much longer until it's time to give him the money.  ",3

well, it's been about three weeks since my post and my breakup. and it took almost that full time to let it sink in what i've really done. i self wallowed for some time and attempted to guilt trip her and get my siblings to talk to her for me. what a mistake that was. she called and ripped me a new one worse than you guys did. she told me that she was thrilled we're not together and that i'm manipulative and ""disgusting."" that left me really shocked and i had to review my behavior over the time we had been together. i think over my life i always had an idea that with enough perseverance anyone's mind can be changed. i don't know where i got this from. i guess i thought it was a sign of being a strong person. like taking what you want from life even when the chances are slim. it sounds stupid because it is. i reread my post just now and cringed the whole way through. even the language i used showed that she was right and i am manipulative. she's a human being and i didn't treat her with respect. i played with our relationship to get her to change her mind about something very important to her. i deserve what happened. i also have realized that our views on the relationship were a little different. she had never brought up marriage or anything while it had crossed my mind almost daily because i really was so enamored. so i probably looked insane going on about having three children. it sounds so stupid to me now. among the things she said on the phone, one was that she found my lack of respect for her body and choices appalling. i wasn't asking her to be forgiven, but i wanted to express how much her and her son meant to me. and as most dumped people tend to do, i couldn't even give a shit about what i was bitching about in the first place. i miss going to the park with her and her son. those days were nice and calm and i didn't appreciate them. i let some fictional children and my bad habits ruin something good. i have a lot of self reflecting to do, and while i'm still sad, i know now that her dumping me was really for the best. thanks guys for being honest.

"for eating a lot at a wedding buffet?. i (17m) eat a good amount of food. based on my body type and physical activity, i've been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.

my aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents' house. it was originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/dj meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.

this was problematic because i needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that day, as i had only been excused for the morning one. i ended up going to both practices, had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there. i only ate a protein bar during the drive, so i was thrilled to find a well-stocked buffet after the reception.

i loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. i was going to get a third round when my mom pulled me aside. she had been giving me weird looks during the meal, and told me to cut it out, and that if i was still hungry i could make something when we got home.

now, i would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. i ate a good amount, but i doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.

she eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. i would have eaten more, but she put her foot down. there was still some extra food left once the meal service ended.

once we left, my mom went on a rant about how i was ""making aunt and her fiancee fund my cheat day."" i told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not them, and i wasn't depriving anyone else since i went back for more once most people were done.

i'm not sure if i violated some social norm, but i feel like i was justified. aita, reddit?

me and my wife are both in our 40s and we've been married for about 15 years. i'm very passionated about sports cars and i own for the time being only a sports car. this led my wife to borrowing this car for the last 6 months whenever she needed to get somewhere. i care for the car a lot as it was both expensive and was bought as a ""milestone"" in life that i've worked very hard for. well, here is the problem she damaged it about 2 months ago (minor dent) that i was able to fix for not too much money at a local shop. now, one week ago she managed to damage it again and this time we're going to have to order this part which comes out to about 2-3k.

so i told her that she will no be allowed to drive it anymore as i neither want to pay for the repairs or want to repair the car as it will affect the value when i sell it if it has been repaired a lot etc.

so she got really upset about this and i told her that she should get her own car when she wants to go to the city to do shopping. this blew into a pretty big fight and even though i didn't budge and we kinda sorted it out i still feel like she is pissed at me. so..

edit: to clarify: the sports car is the only car that i currently own, i used to have another car but i sold it. i've planned on getting another car for her to use as we had before in the future.

context update:  it's not like we barely have any money to spare. she makes over $100k a year (she makes a bit more than i do). and could go and buy a car today if she wanted to. the problem is just the fact that i don't let her drive my car which is pissing her off.

edit 2: saw this post blow up and thanks for all the replies. some made me think again on how this played out and i just wanted to answer a few questions here instead of replying to every single comment on the post.

1. my wife do not use the car to get to work, she gets picked up by her driver. yes driver. lol. (provided by her work).
2. she only uses the car when she wants to go shopping, we live in the city so it is only used when she is shopping ""heavy things"".
3. we've talked several times about her getting a car which she always postpones for some reason.
4. yes, i did ""warn"" her that i would not want her to be driving the car the first time she dented it.
5. i do no treat my wife as a child.
6. we have our own personal things that we own, she has a horse. the horse is hers not mine. the car is mine not hers. i'm not sure where all of you are from where everything in a marriage is splitted 50/50. we also own things together of course.
7. the reason i sold my ""other"" car is that i felt i already spent so much on this new car and i didn't want to have two cars when we do not use them for anything else but me hobby driving and her occasional shopping and some other minor things.
8. a lot of people wanna know, the car is a 2017 911 991 turbo
9. i'm not a multimillionaire and neither is she. that is the reason for why i'm not (as some people suggests) ""go out and buy her a car and get over with it"". i saved up for many many years for the car. i don't have money to buy another decent car for her to use without stretching my budget very very far.
10. a lot of people asking regarding the ""driver who picks her up"" and it not making sense earning 100k. i'm not sure it is normal at other companies but at hers they offer this service. my wife makes well over 100k, the reason i said 100k is because it thought it would be enough to prove my point that she can afford a car. she makes somewhere around 250. i make around 175. we have a lot of expenses, 5 kids all going to go to uni at some point so we're also saving for these types of things and therefore a lot of the money we make is automatically put into these funds and only a small portion goes into ""our own"" saving accounts. this is where i during the course of many many years saved up for my car, also we did not earn this much our entire lives. 
11. both the times she damaged the car it was in our parking garage, her fault. nobody else but her and the concrete pillars involved.

"for not wanting to interact with my biological children?. back in 98 and 99 i donated sperm to my cousin and his wife. he had been left sterilized by his chemotherapy treatments and he and his wife were devastated. they asked me as i was his only male relative of the same age and i agreed. the contract stated that i was relieved of all parental and monetary duty. after his kids were born i told them that if they chose to tell them the truth i would never be a part of there lives as i was starting my own family at the time and he seemed to understand.

i haven't seen him or his kids for over 10 years now as i've gone no contact with the family for my own reasons. today both of his kids reached out to me. they both told me that they know i'm their real dad and want me to meet with them. i respectfully declined and told them that while they are biologically mine, i'm not their dad. since then i've been getting texts and calls from the family telling me im terrible. both of his kids seem to be devastated for some reason and really want to meet me and are acting like i'm rejecting them.

"for telling my disabled son and his partner i disapprove of their relationship?. i'm fully prepared to be called an asshole.

my son is 23 and has cerebral palsy that is quite severe. it only affects him physically. he is very smart. i have recently setup his financials where he gets his disability sent to  him directly and got him his own place. 

his caregiver visits him daily at his new place. i did this because i wanted my son to be independent. 

he did very well for a few months but recently he has gotten into a relationship with a 58 year old man that i simply do not approve of.

it's not that i'm homophobic. but it's the fact that this man older then me has now moved in with my son. they've only known each other for three months.

and what's worse is that my son isn't gay. i had a heartfelt conversation where my son broke down and admitted he isn't gay but is scared of dying alone.

i have been heartbroken ever since and tried to setup some counseling sessions only to find out that his partner is double booking activities on those days and forcing my son to choose.

i'm not sure what this older man's deal is. he is contributing around 25% of the rent and seems to work.

last sunday i had them over for lunch and i couldn't control myself. i called him a predator and i thought he was disgusting. he then proceeded to take it on himself to physically push my son out the house without even asking.

my son called me after and said that what i did was wrong and i don't understand his predicament.

every instinct in me is telling me that man is bad news. 

i'm contemplating reporting him to the authorities. but that might be going too far and my son will likely resent me.

was i really the asshole for calling out that creep like that? 

all i want is for my son to be happy. and right now, i really don't think this situation with a man he isn't attracted to is making him happy. but he is 23 and i may have overstepped.",3
"for choosing my cousin and friends over my family for a trip i won to japan?. so i participated in the genius olympiad (a science comp.) and didn't win the best prize but won me a 2-way air ticket to japan for me plus 3. so i decided that those plus 3 would me my cousin and 2 of my good friends. my parents and sister are furious i didn't chose them after they offered to pay for the hotel. but i denied as i was once false accused of physical harassment of a girl when i was in high school ( the girl's cool dad took back the charges and confessed publicly that the girl was depressed and wanted attention) and no one but my friends and cousin believed me that i was innocent.  they apologized and were very sorry, but i mean you must have trust in your son and brother, and its too late for them to get my respect anymore.

"update: for refusing to apologise to my sister?. original(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/beaaz7/aita_for_refusing_to_apologise_to_my_sister/)

so my sister's wedding was today. i took the advice of people here and apologised to keep the peace/make things easier for my mum, but told her that my partner and i are kind of a package deal and that either both of us come or neither of us do. she stuck to her guns and said that my partner wasn't welcome, at first maintaining that it was because of his tattoos and then eventually getting emotional and yelling at me that he wasn't allowed after ""what he'd done to her"", which confirms my theory that it was because he rejected her years ago. i just calmly kept telling her that if she didn't want him to come then fine, but not to expect me either. 

i guess she thought i wasn't being serious, because i got a call from my mum shortly before the ceremony was due to start asking where i was. i told her i wasn't coming. i got a *lot* of rather abusive texts from my stepfather, telling me he always knew i was worthless but this was a new level, as well as some direct threats. i ignored them all, though i did text mum and apologise for causing problems but i *did* inform my sister i wouldn't be going. culminated about an hour ago with my stepfather and now brother in law showing up drunk at my flat and trying to fight me while my sister cried outside. they got removed by building security, and honestly it was more funny than anything to me. apparently i've ruined her wedding day, but i'm really struggling to care. maybe that makes me now the asshole, i can accept that. 

just thought i would share this update, since i posted about it here initially.

eta: clarifying a couple of things that people seem confused on.

first the whole ""she got rejected by my boyfriend"" thing. this one is my fault, i thought i'd included the story in my original post but looking back it was actually in the comments, so apologies for any confusion there! essentially what happened is that about 6 years ago, when he was 17 and she was 26, she propositioned him for sex (~~don't blame her he's hot as fuck~~ that was a poorly worded joke that fell flat, striking it out since some of y'all got triggered) and was told no. she's held a grudge ever since - i think, in part, because she was told no for pretty much the first time in her life and also later because he chose to get with me when he'd said he wasn't interested i her. he was fully out at the time she propositioned him and she was definitely aware he was gay. 

second, some people are seemingly confused and thinking this whole thing was a one off incident that led to me not going to the wedding/wanting to lessen/cut contact with her. this is not the case and is again probably due to a lack of communication on my part so again, apologies. i'll clear up that we've *never* has a good relationship, and she's been pretty cruel to the point it could be considered emotionally abusive to me since i was very small. she's also been physically abusive at several points throughout my life. this is not a debate of me placing my relationship over my family but, rather, one of me finally taking up for myself after years of being a pushover and the aftermath it's caused.",3
"for wanting to cut my best friend out of my life for stealing my baby name?. 
to start things off, i'm not pregnant. nor am i anywhere near close to being pregnant. however, my best friend is pregnant and i couldn't be more happy for her. as best friends do, we started discussing baby names. she asked me if i had any baby names picked out for my future children and i told her my mother had suggested a name years ago for my future daughter that i absolutely fell in love with. it's super unique and it's a name that originates from the country she was born in. my mother is no longer alive, so this is something i really wanted to do in the future so my potential daughter could have a connection to her grandmother. 
a few days ago, i saw on facebook that my best friend posted a picture of those 3d sonograms and in the post she revealed the name that she had picked for her daughter. it was the name i told her that i had picked out for my future daughter. i am absolutely devastated she would do this to me. she knows what that name meant to me and she decided to use it anyway. she says it's just a name and since she's pregnant before me she gets to use whatever name she wants. i told her she's being heartless and asked her how she can do this to someone she sees as a sister. she is not going to change her mind about this, so i want to end all communication with her since i can't even imagine calling her daughter by the name i wanted for mine. am i the asshole for doing this?

*just some more information: this isn't an american/english name, it's a middle eastern one. she isn't middle eastern.

edit 2: wow, i just finished work and i honestly didn't think this post would blow up this much. thank you to everyone who took the time to comment, regardless of your opinion on this post. my friend hasn't reached out to me since the last time we spoke, but i'm honestly over it all and don't want to continue our friendship. if there is an update to the situation, i'll be sure to post about it.

"if i left my son at home while the rest of the family went on vacation?. 

my son,11, has been acting up in school. not doing his homework, talking during lessons, picking on other kids, getting write-ups,detentions, and just being a little brat. 

at home he's disrespectful as well, picking on his siblings, talking back etc. every  other year our family takes a really big vacation. 

this year we are going to california for 3 weeks. he's never been and really- really wants to go. 

i've told him all year if he doesn't behave he won't go to california. when i remind him he behaves for a few days or so then goes back to being bratty. 

his teacher said that even if he passes all of his next test and homework he will only have a 2.3 at most(she even gave him extra credit assignments). we agreed on a 3.0 or higher for california. 

i told my son that he won't be able to go to california, he laughed and said ""yea right"". 
if i keep him home with grandma while myself and the rest of the family take the trip?

update: oh wow i did not except sooo many replies. i am reading all of them but i can't respond to everyone. i just want you to know how much i appreciate you all reaching out. the trip is next month and we(my spouse and i) have yet to come to a final decision. today my son was very disrespectful. he knocked a plate of food out of my daughters hand. and sneaked and stole back his ipad from my office. so as of today it's still a no go. which he scoffs at.  i will post an update on what we will do.  thank you all again

second update: the trip is still weeks away but my spouse and i have decided that our son will not join.  4 days ago he got into trouble for stealing his teachers purse. they found out it was him because it had her phone in it and they tracked it back to our home. he still had the purse in his closet. all of the money was gone but her medication and credit cards were untouched(clearly he's not a criminal mastermind).

"for blasting my horn at a person using their phone whilst driving?. this happened about 30 minutes ago. 

i was driving home with a friend. we were coming up to a roundabout that was clear from my side. as i was passing over, a woman came speeding past from the left, causing me to have to slow down substantially in the middle of the roundabout. 

she was on her phone, holding it by her head with her elbow resting on the open window, speaking into it. i blasted my horn at her, a slight bit of road rage sure, but this startled her and caused her to drop her phone out the car window. 

i don't know what happened after that, but it's a busy roundabout so i doubt she was able to retrieve it before it was smashed into a million pieces. the person i was driving with blasted me, saying i shouldn't have done that and i was an asshole for causing the destruction of what was presumably an expensive phone. i disagree, play stupid games win stupid prizes and all that. but, my friend is insistent that i was an asshole. 

aita?

edit: women to woman.

edit: okay holy shit this blew up. i can't read through all the comments, so i'll just try clear up a couple things. 

1) this is in england, we give way to the right and not the left. the roundabout was a 2 lane on a busy street, no pedestrian access. 

2) for those saying obviously nta, karma whoring etc - i get it. if i could lock this post now i would. however, there's been quite a few esh's and yta's with good points, and i'm now thinking whilst nta feels good, and there is a sense of instant karma, esh is probably more appropriate. i shouldn't have blazed my horn, it wasn't really an emergency, and in doing so i could've caused a worse accident.

some people don't seem to understand how roundabouts in england work. to try clear things up, i've drawn the worlds worst diagram.

probably the last update. i've seen a lot of people saying ""she"", i'm a guy, just to clear that up. also seen a lot of people ripping me for using ""whilst"", i had no idea this was so bad, can someone tell me why?",3
"for telling my brother-in-law that he ruined me and my husband's wedding night?. a bit of backstory, my husband's brother (we'll call him tony) is the youngest in their sibling trio. tony is 29 and got married about 3 years ago. when tony married his wife, before my now husband and i met, my husband (larry) did a little ""prank"" on tony's wedding night. larry got some of that washable car window paint and wrote ""just married"" on the back and put balloons under a tarp in the bed of the trunk to be lifted. larry also placed a few boxes of condoms in the truck to be funny. i've seen pictures of this myself, if i can find them, i will attach them in an edit. 

flash forward to my husband and i's wedding night, as we were returning to my husbands truck, we noticed tony did a ""prank"" of his own. he covered my husbands truck in pink washable paint, put personal lubricant all over the outside and stuck feminine hygiene products all over it. he also threw condoms out of the package inside the truck, threw glitter on both the inside and the outside of the truck, and confetti. 

my husband and i were outraged, we saw this as going too far and also made my 11 year old daughter very uncomfortable. tony didn't see the problem and neither did the family, they all thought it was hilarious. we drove the truck back to the hotel and spent hours cleaning the inside. 

while we were cleaning, i called tony and very calmly explained to him that he upset larry and i and that we had to spend hours cleaning it. i also explained that the wash on the outside of the truck wasn't going to be cheap, to which tony said, ""use the money i gave you guys for your wedding present for that then."" which angered me more and i hung up on him. i did not cuss at him nor did i yell. 

after we spent nearly $50 cleaning the exterior of the truck, i got a very nasty call from tony in which he called me a b*tch, couldn't take a joke, and worst of all, felt bad for my daughter that i had an uptight woman like me as her mother. i didn't say anything back, i just hung up. 

the next day, i wake up to texts from his family saying that i was too harsh on tony, that tony drove 7hrs for our wedding, and he was just ""getting larry back"" for what happened at his wedding. larry told me that he actually deleted texts that tony sent me over night because he was ""embarrassed by what his brother said."" 

i refuse to talk to tony and so does my husband until we get an apology for what he did and said. i apologized to tony for perhaps being too harsh, which i admit, wasn't a genuine apology. but, i expected an apology back. instead i got more ""poor me"" from tony. larry &amp;amp; tony's parents texted me saying i need to ""stop creating drama"" and step back and think about how this makes tony feel. but, i think my ignoring tony is valid as what he said before was very hurtful. 

i've been called an asshole by tony himself. and i'm wondering if there's something here that i'm missing

aita?


**update: brother-in-law posted to facebook with a totally false story**

and here's what he posted(https://m.imgur.com/a/t6qglj8) 

so, i thought there were two photos according to my mother posted on facebook but it's just this one. that only shows the front of the truck before the vaseline/pink paint/rest of the sanitary products were added. brother-in-law posted that ""i tony welcomed op to the family with open arms and she cussed me out then insulted me!""

yeah, *i'm sorry, what?* i did **not** cuss him out nor did i insult him as my young daughter was around. he also added, ""op should get over herself as it wasn't even that bad."" yeah, good job cherry picking what you wanted everyone to see. only his wife, their sister, and their father saw the actual final product with us when we did. everyone else in the family, this is all their seeing and they now have the perspective that i cussed out *poor tony*. 

i asked larry what the deleted messages said and larry told me the gist of it was, ""op and her daughter will never really be apart of this family."" and larry said thats the less insulting way to put it. 

i'm sorry if this seems rude but i am very upset as tony just threw more gasoline at an already ignited flame. larry said that he's going to take care of it from here and that if i get involved more, tony is just going to make more lies up. 

anyway, i appreciate everyone's replies! a lot were very helpful, larry and i are definitely going to apply some of the advice given. i'm still refusing to speak to tony until he apologizes to what he said about myself and my daughter including embarrassing her when a condom fell on her in the truck. hopefully things work out soon! i don't want to start off my entrance to this family badly, either. thanks again!

edit: you can see one of the condoms in the truck actually and some of the streamers and glitter. it might not be high-res, sorry. there is two tampons and a pad visible in the photo.

edit 2: i'm sorry, i did not take any photos of the final product of the truck, i should've. i was still pretty fuming from everything else though, i didnt really think of it. i'm going to ask larry if he has any screenshots of the texts.",3
"for telling her to ""know her place""?. throwaway account cause several friends know my main account.

&#x200b;

i (f27) have been friends with a guy; steve since i was 12. there is a group of us - and key point is that i am the only girl. i don't really know 'why' i'm the girl of the group; but i am. outside of my recent ex; tom, of 3 years, i have never once liked or been liked by any of these guys. i am not a ""pretty"" girl, and i describe my taste in clothes as 'meh'. i'm not fashion savvy or makeup savvy, etc. let me say this again - steve and i have never touched beyond hugging. the most intimate we've gotten was probably him carrying me home when i broke my foot once.

&#x200b;

about 4 months ago, tom and i broke up, and at the same time steve began dating this girl abby. abby is beautiful and knows all the things that i wish i knew about being a woman. so, upon meeting her, i was warm, friendly and was even asking for fashion advice when i met her. i wanted to be her friend. abby was quiet, and not as warm, but i put that down to shyness.

&#x200b;

last night steve, abby, tom, myself and a few others went out for dinner and drinks. i continued being friendly to abby, while not really having a response to that. i went to the bathroom and when i came out of the stall abby was standing there waiting for me.

&#x200b;

i'll cut a giant argument short, but abby accused me of breaking up with tom to get with steve and told me that she will do whatever she has to do to get rid of me, stating that it was ""super weird"" that i was the only girl friends with a group of guys, insinuating that i'd slept with all of them, but then also implying that i should have left the group when tom and i broke up. my response to this was to tell abby to 'know' her place and that i had been around for much longer than her, and that if anyone was going to be ""gotten rid of"" it'd be her because we had been through the jealous girlfriend situation before and steve had chosen me, and would never seriously consider a girl that hated his best friend.

&#x200b;

abby went out and told steve i attacked her - who didn't believe a word and broke up with her on the spot. since then, i've gotten messages from abby's friends on social media to tell me what a whore, bitch, slut, i am and that steve and i were fucking the whole time. one girl even sent these messages to my family to 'warn' me about what kind of 'slut' i am. my own brother says he feels that i've caused this drama myself by

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

extra info as required:

holy shit - didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. and i did not expect gold at all - so thanks? 

&#x200b;

unfortunately i did mean 27 in the post - i failed to mention that abby is actually 22; but i do highly accept that i could have handled the situation much better; i am not a confrontational person. i grew up in an abusive home (in particular from my step-mother and step-sister) and my general response to conflict is tears (which i hate) or just bolting and ghosting a situation. i think being ambushed is why i lost my cool. 

&#x200b;

i read a lot of comments about how this came off as ""not like other girls"". i don't know how to not make it do so. i'm simply not ""good"" at being friends with other girls. i'm shy, awkward, i stumble over my words; and because i \*want\* to be friends with them, it comes off as desperate and overdone. i do have girl acquaintances but it never goes beyond the occasional coffee time. 

&#x200b;

boundaries - i'm not a touchy-feely person outside of if i'm actually in a relationship or seeking a relationship with someone. again - childhood abuse. once we got out of high school and stopped seeing each other as frequently - we do a quick side hug goodbye. 3 of the other guys have girlfriends who all seem to enjoy my company when we are together. 

&#x200b;

somebody mentioned that i'm obviously into my friends if i got with tom. tom and i kissed as a joke once, sensed the chemistry and things went from there. we all thought it was going to be forever - but tom got some bad health news and put ""us"" on hold until/unless it ends positively. he doesn't want to put me through that. 

&#x200b;

the long version of the argument began with abby asking why i was wearing such an inappropriate outfit for someone who'd just broken up with someone (jeans, boots and a shirt); i stared at her in shock and said ""what the fuck - what's going on?"" and then she straight away started with the accusations. 

&#x200b;

as a last note - the previous girlfriend of steve's happened when we were about 16; and when that happened, i stepped back completely and began distancing myself from everyone. it was about 2 weeks before tom of all people got it out of me and he went to steve and told him. i offered to leave the friendship and not make their lives a burden or whatever the words i said were, and they all said ""no, she's in the wrong"" and that any girlfriend who couldn't/wouldn't understand i was a friend/sister was not the girl they wanted to spend time with. this was repeated to me this morning when i showed the messages i was getting from abby and her friends. i was apologising profusely (and for my part in the argument - telling her to 'know her place' which was such bad wording on my part - i know) and was told by steve ""well she obviously wasn't wife material then"". being friends with these guys for so long and that i should have stuck with girls instead, or ended the friendships once we all started dating in high school. he also feels that i'm leading on any man i'm with by having male friends who they then have to question constantly if i have or am sleeping with. so - aita?",3
"if i tell my pregnant wife that she is the most insecure person i've ever met?. this sounds really bad but please hear me out. 

my wife is pregnant with our daughter. i'm really excited and happy for us. but my wife is convinced that  i'm cheating on her. she gets these weird dreams where i cheat on her. she wakes me up in the middle of the night to ask me if i still love her. i was really fine with that. i thought the harmones were messing with her.

but this quickly escalated. she asked me to install a tracking app which i did for her sake. but i get really pissed when she calls me after checking my location to bring her something. for example if i'm near a store, she'll ask me to bring her something from that store.

"for refusing to adopt my wife's two kids after discovering who the real father is?. i am a 35 years old guy, and i was lucky enough to marry my crush (27f) two years ago. we met at work, where she was a receptionist for the big building my company is in. anyways, she has two daughters, 6 and 7 years old.

when i married my wife, i was a bit iffy at the idea of being a dad so fast and so suddenly to two kids that aren't mine, but i love my wife so much i am willing to sacrifice my man-time and a portion of my salary to take care of the kids.

to be honest, i've had my ups and downs with them (you know, kids) and sometimes i think i'd be happier going back to my ""lone wolf"" life. but i fully know that this is my life now and i try my best to suck it up and do what i signed up for.

back to the story: i know the kids dad had died only from my wife's words and i've never had reason to doubt that.

it has been two or three months since she started convincing me that i should adopt them as a birthday gift for both of them (their birthday happens in two consecutive days, coincidence). i'd be fine with that, it's just paper for what i would do anyways.

i agreed to that and she said she'd get on with the documents. well fantastic! i thought. i like not having to do anything. what really got me suspicious is how she changed her behaviour with her phone and laptop. she started putting the phone face down, and she created a totally different user for her laptop she switches to when she's with me.

i thought she was cheating so i did what every scumbag like me would do, i spied on her. long story short, i come to know by a very reliable source that…. her ex-husband isn't paying alimony anymore as he is in jail with no money to his account. the world crushed on me. first i thought the guy was dead, now i discover he is alive, paying alimony to my wife's bank account while i was financially providing too.

i confronted my wife and she didn't deny any of it. she started crying and she was adamant that she did that only for the kids' well being. she was putting the alimony money he ex was giving her into an account for when the kids will be 18 yo (i have no proof of that). she also said that it was a while since she felt i should adopt them, as they love me and they look up to me. she was firm about stating that nothing happened with her ex husband while she was with me. she said that her ex is ""dead"" for her by all means. she admitted that she lied, but for good purposes - as she was scared that a guy like me would be scared by her reckless past. that's not who she is anymore, as she is focused on family and on us.

now, i need to find out more about her ex-husband that's for sure. i am also furious with my wife for not trusting me enough to come clean about her past. meanwhile, will i be an asshole if i refuse to adopt the kids (they have a dad and he's alive!) and if i state that i will retract from them all the financial support in case i decide to get a divorce?

edit: it's child support not alimony, sorry english is not my first language.",3
"if i canceled my nephew's college fund over his rudeness?. my wife and i have been married for 12 years, and the nephew in question is my brother's oldest son, who i'll call michael for this post. michael is 16 and the oldest of my brother's two boys. 

michael was a baby when my wife and i got together, and she has always treated him and my brother's other son like family, just the same as she treats her own siblings' kids. my wife has a significant inheritance and we both earn generous wages, and it was her idea to open college savings accounts for michael and his brother when they were babies. this is likely to be the only family money for college they'll receive.

anyway, the story: last weekend, my brother and the boys came over for dinner and we all had a nice time, though the youngest one was on his switch the whole time and michael was on his phone. i didn't think anything of it until the following tuesday, when i found my wife sobbing after work and she showed me an instagram post made by michael, who apparently is too stupid to realize we both follow him (as do his grandparents). 

he posted a picture of my wife from behind and a picture he apparently took of her underwear laid out on our bed, both mocking her size (she is overweight) and calling her a 'big bitch' among other things. my wife was devastated and humiliated and hurt, because she's always had a good relationship with him.

i'm furious and want to cancel his college savings account right now, taxes be damned. my wife says she'd be too embarrassed to do this since she's an adult and shouldn't be so hurt by a child, and just wants to pretend it didn't happen. i already told his dad and let his dad deal with it at home, but i'm still furious and want to cancel the account monday.

if i did this? is it too much? he won't have any family money for school if i do but that isn't my problem if he comes into my home and violates my wife's privacy and disrespects her like that.

edit: i am overwhelmed by the number of kind and thoughtful responses i received and can't reply to all of them, but i really appreciate everyone taking the time. i didn't expect the thread to blow up like this so to say it gives me a lot to think about is an understatement. i have some thinking to do and will update in a few days when i've cooled down a bit.",3
"for watching a wwe pay per view (money in the bank) on my phone while at a wedding that was meaningless to me?. so this goes back almost a month now to may 19th but my wife and mom are still so furious with me that my wife may divorce me and my mom may take her side over it. i need some honest feedback to help me go forward. 

i'm a huge wwe fan and i pretty much get all the ppv. money in the bank, there was a ton i wanted to see but it also culminates several story lines into a ladder match that i really wanted to see. it was may 19th and i made it very clear i wanted to watch the event. on may 9th my wife announced that shed been invited to a coworkers wedding and i had to go with her (by a crazy coincidence that we didn't know until we got there, the grooms mom is my moms good friend). i assumed the wedding woukd be on saturday so i agreed. well saturday the 18th came and went and it wasn't until the 19th when my wife was pissed i wasn't getting ready that i was like oh shit, i can't go because of rhe ppv. she got so mad at me so i relented and went. 

it was one of those events where there i didn't know a single person besides my wife and my mom and rhe groom was sort of a dick. so after he sort of blew me off when i tried to congratulate him i was like fuck this and i got out my phone, parked myself in the corner and bought the ppv. my wife and now mom kept trying to get me away and be social and finally i got pissed and told them both to leave me the fuck alone. 

things honest to god haven't been the same since. she says i looked like such and asshole with my phone in my face in a semi-dark room while everyone else was having fun and dancing. my mom says her friends all noticed me and commented that i must have been autistic or retarded so she's massively embarrased. 

to me i had plans, i did my part to attend and when i didn't know anyone i made the best of a bad situation to do what i wanted anyways.

was i the asshole?


edit: 

to address the common repeats:

1. no i don't do network, my wife would come unglued if i have 24/7 access to something she hates so much. i still do ppv even though its more expensive. 

2. invitation was only 10 days in advance because the bride claims she just ""forgot"" to send our invitation and only realized at the last minute when ""we"" hadn't rsvp'd. that's the bride and my wife's story, believe it if you do or don't. 

3. yes it was a crazy coincidence my mom was at the wedding. but since we got a late invite and i don't speak with my mom all that often i would have no way of knowing in advance. the bride is my wife's coworker, the groom's mom is my mom' friend from some charity they work on together. i'd never met any of them. 

any thing else i can clear up without having to answer over and over?",3
"for basically snapping at a stranger who spoke to me in mandarin because of my appearance?. i'm a 25m chinese american - i have familial roots in hk (thus i look asian) but grew up in the us. also of note is that i recently finished a masters degree in germany, speak adequate german, and am back in my us hometown for two weeks.

so, i'm in line at starbucks when a white guy gets in line behind me, gets my attention and asks me something in mandarin with a smile. which i don't understand. when i stare at him blankly he repeats himself, then asks me in english if i spoke mandarin. it felt like a bad pick-up attempt.

besides being morning-grumpy, i've heard stories from female friends of mine of getting approached with ni hao or konichiwa just because they were asian, the majority of which were crude pick-up lines. and personally i take poorly to the assumption of someone's ethnicity and culture when in the us; english should be the only one assumed imo. so in that moment i not-so-politely responded in german ""ich spreche kein chinesisch. sprichst du deutsch, da du weiß aussiehst?"" (i don't speak chinese. do you speak german, because you look white?) i'm assuming he didn't understand any of that, but he muttered ""sorry"" and i turned back around and ordered my drink - in english.

i didn't think much of it until now, and while all i did was mirror his own actions (assume his mother tongue) i'm wondering if this was crossing the line. thoughts?",3
"for not tipping the pizza place on an order for 35 pizzas?. not my story, but my brother's, and i'm really unsure where i stand on it.

my little brother, is doing an internship with a large corporation. he organized an internal food drive, in which the floor that donates the most wins free pizza for lunch on a friday. 

at the conclusion of the food drive, my brother called the pizza place on a monday and asked about the logistics of ordering 35 pizzas, on a friday, during lunch hour. they said it wouldn't be a problem, and to place the order wednesday morning. 

he calls back wednesday, and speaks with the same manager. the manager tells him they can no longer do the order, as it's too big of an order to do during their friday lunch rush. he recommends my brother try the middle of the following week, and they agree on the following tuesday.

monday rolls around and my brother places the order, and uses the corporate credit card to pay over the phone. the manager then tells him they cannot have 35 pizzas ready at 12:30, but can have 18 ready at noon, and another 17 ready at 12:45. my brother tells him that would work. when asked what to put on the line for a tip amount, my brother responds $0.

noon on tuesday, my brother shows up at the pizza place, picks up the first 18 pizzas, and delivers them to the winning office floor lunch room. then, he returns to the store to pick up the remaining 17 pizzas. 

while waiting for the second round of pizzas at the store, the following exchange occurs:

manager: ""are you going to leave a tip?""

brother: ""no.""

manager: ""usually with large orders like this you are required to leave a tip""

brother: ""you aren't delivering or serving these pizzas. when we talked on the phone yesterday you did not mention a mandatory tip"".

manager: ""it's corporate policy that orders this large require a 15% gratuity"". 

brother: ""that isn't what we agreed to on the phone yesterday. i'm not leaving a tip"".

manager: ""well then you aren't getting the rest of your pizzas"". 

at this point, my brother and the manager begin arguing, escalating to the point of my brother's coworker pulling him to the side and recommending a small tip (5%). my brother relents. he tells the manager he will leave a tip, but he wants to choose the amount. he hands the manager his card, who runs it and hands him back a new receipt for the order, with a 15% gratuity assessed ($125 instead of $40).

my brother then gets into a yelling match with the manager, and is escorted out of the restaurant by his coworker. 

is my brother the asshole?",3
"update: for not wanting to participate in my niece's wedding after she excluded my daughter?. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c7jfwy/aita_for_not_wanting_to_participate_in_my_nieces/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app

hey everyone! this is the daughter writing the update. my mom didn't know how to do an update post and asked me to write it for her. we're both here to respond to comments if you have any.

i saw that a few people asked what my aunt's opinion was after the verdict was given on this post! here is the answer to that question: my aunt said that she had told my cousin from the beginning that excluding me was going to hurt my feelings and suggested to her that i be a bridesmaid instead of my mother. my cousin turned down this suggestion but would not say why. 

i also saw some people wondering if something had gone down between my cousin and me that i wasn't telling my mom. this is definitely valid question! the answer is no, she and i haven't had any problems prior to this (that i know of, at least). she has always been like a sister to me. if she ever had a problem with me or anything i've done i would hope she would tell me.

another question i saw was about my relationship with my father. he and i have a very tense relationship due largely to some mental heath problems that he has. prior to all of this i had confided in my cousin a lot about this. this made her decision to include him over me hurtful in a very poignant way.

after reading all of your comments and some more deliberation, my mom ended up staying in the wedding party. i appreciate her desire to stand up for me but i really did want my cousin's wedding to go smoothly (despite my feelings being very hurt). my mom respected my wishes. she is an amazing mom all around and i am lucky to have her in my corner. 

after the conversation i had with my cousin (described in the last post) i was on the fence about attending the wedding. i then heard from other relatives that she was concerned that i would ""sabotage the wedding"" if i were to attend. i found this comment to be bizarre and confusing. at this point i decided that it would be best to remove myself from the situation entirely. i told her that i wouldn't be attending and left it at that. it was a hard decision to make, but your reactions to the original post made me feel more confident in my choice.

the wedding did end up going smoothly. i heard from multiple sources that there was plenty of extra room in the bridal suite. i wish i could have been there with my family to support her on her big day. she and i have both been part of each other's major life milestones for as long as i can remember. i still haven't figured out why i was the only one excluded but i have come to the conclusion that she and i must not be as close as i had always thought we were. at this point i'm not sure that i want to be. your feedback on the original post played a large part in me realizing that.

thanks to everyone for reading and for all of your responses! we got great insight from everyone who commented (especially those with different perspectives from our own). if you guys have any more questions feel free to comment!",3
"for using the word ""miscarry"" to beat my wife in scrabble?. for context, my wife and i have always been extremely competitive. it's an important part of our relationship, and she has gotten pissed at me in the past when she perceives i have thrown a game intentionally to spare her the sadness of losing. 

tonight as we were playing scrabble, i had the option to play the word ""miscarry"" to win the game. from what i could tell, there were no other words i could've played that would have resulted in me winning.

sadly, a few months she had a miscarriage. it is still a sensitive topic. i chose to play the word, and she was super upset and hurt since i had the option to play the word. she is currently not speaking to me cause i failed to immediately apologize. 

i think in the context of our relationship, she is overreacting. here??

edit 1: i have apologized profusely, and did so pretty quickly after (just not as i was playing the tiles). regardless, looks like the consensus is pretty clear.. thankfully she's a very forgiving woman.",3
"for keeping my marriage and child a secret from my mother, as well as refusing to let her see my son?. the secrecy started early. i am a gay woman. at 15 when i came out, my mom simply disagreed. she told me i wasn't gay. she said i was jealous. that these girls looked better than me and i was jealous of them, not attracted to them. she genuinely thinks it's impossible for me to be gay and never took it seriously. it got to a point where i didn't tell her if i met anyone.

skip to when i met my wife. when i'd finally let my mom know about her(we had been together two years now) the convo went like this:

me: we want to get married.
her, extremely disdainful: oh you do? well let me tell you something, throwawaygayallday, you're going to want a man. your car breaks down, you're screwed. you need heavy stuff moved? screwed. two women can't make love. you're going to want a man in bed with you.

i hung up on her, i was so fucking mad. i married my wife without telling my parents.

i never told my mom we wanted a child and never told her of his birth. when i visited for christmas, i went alone. i'm not sure when i planned to tell her or how. i just hadn't gotten around to doing it. serious procrastination and dread.

my wife and i live a few hours from my parents. they've never visited(they don't know my address) and when we spend time together, i go to them. they do pass through on the way to visit other family though. they had stopped at our wal-mart to get last-minute items and that's when they saw us.

i was there getting stuff for dinner and had my son in the cart seat. we were going down an aisle when i heard ""hey kiddo!"" from behind. i recognized my mom's voice and turned to face her, ready to do introductions. but damn man, the instant she saw my son, she gave him the dirtiest fucking look and said ""whose kid?""

me, now pissed: mine
her: what do you mean he's yours?
me: i mean he's mine
her: he can't be yours
me: ever heard of ivf?
her: so you went and spent god knows how much money to have a kid with your girlfriend
me: wife
her: and when were you going to tell me about all this?
me: i don't know, i don't want to talk about it in the middle of the store

i walked away and checked out, her following, still talking shit.

i put my son and food in the car and left. my mom called later. i tried to talk to her. i apologized for the secrecy, said she gets condescending when we talk about these things. she denied this. she then went on about how i didn't invite her to the wedding, that she'll never get that moment back and see me get married(which i do feel bad about).

she eventually asked when i would bring my son over. i said never. i said i wasn't going to bring him there when she's so negative toward us. i said she doesn't respect me or my family so she doesn't deserve to know my family. hung up on her and haven't answered her calls or texts. she has apologized for speaking to me the way she has but i don't care at this point. i'm too fucking mad. for not inviting her to the wedding and not allowing her to see my son? is ""never"" too harsh?",3
"update for not wanting my fiancee to dance to a love song dedicated to her late fiance at our wedding?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/aoadwq/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fiancee_to_dance_to_a/

two months ago, i married the love of my life. i was thinking about this thread the other day, how it went, and where my head was at when i made it, and i thought you guys might like an update.

a little anticlimactically, the thing i was stressing about was a bit of a miscommunication, which probably happens a lot here. kayla wanted to dance with her late fiance's (i'll go ahead and just call him luke from now on) father at our wedding, and vanilla twilight was an example of a song along the lines of what she wanted, not the set-in-stone top choice like i had thought. i (and a lot of commenters in the original thread) spent a lot of time over-analyzing the lyrics to that song looking for hidden meaning in every word, while it turns out she hadn't put much more thought into the suggestion than ""this is a kind of sad song that i like.""

we got together that night and she had made several playlists of possible first dance songs for us, songs for when she walks down the aisle, music to play at the reception, and song choices for her dance with luke's father. we spent hours listening to them all and talking about the wedding. we even made a tournament-style bracket for our first dance song in her journal and put songs head to head against each other until the victor emerged. and at the end, we talked about the wedding and our relationship, luke and their relationship, and grief, what it was like when she lost him and what it was like for me when i lost my mom at a young age, what a family is, and all the things we're hopeful for for the future. we stayed up until three in the morning just talking and planning and laughing and crying a little, and i'm so glad for it. after getting bombarded by dozens of different opinions from dozens of different people earlier that day, i had been worried that i was going to have a conflict with my fiancee shortly before our wedding. but there was no conflict, just a pure memory.

after that night, i starting putting in more effort to be involved with the wedding planning process and actually ask for the things i wanted, which kayla actually really appreciated. we also took a long weekend a couple of weeks before the wedding to go on a camping trip together for just the two of us, which i highly recommend to anyone who is getting married. overall, there was a complete flip in my feelings leading up to the wedding from being somewhat insecure and excited but nervous to being completely at ease, excited, and feeling stronger about my relationship than ever.

the wedding day itself was really wonderful and worth the wait. kayla and luke's father had their dance to lean on me, and i also had a dance with kayla's mom and it was very emotional in a good way. i really felt that the day was a celebration of our love, and i was genuinely happy that luke's parents were there to celebrate along with us because they are very much members of our family and i wish i had the space to describe all the ways they've been there for us through the years.

my amazing wife is who she is because of all the experiences that she has had in her life, and i don't want to be the kind of man who asks her to pretend that she has never loved before me or pretend that her grief is something that is or should be done with forever now that she has me. i just want to say how glad i am that we shared that night together and that the wedding was nothing but love and celebration. i never thought i could be so happy.",3
"for repurposing the wedding fund and refusing to compromise?. i have 2 kids, different dads. i have a savings account for both. the account of my oldest, lucy, has had £10 per week added to it by both myself and her father, and has gone up by about a grand a year and is over £13,000. the second account is for my son, luke, who is 6. i have regularly added to this account since i found out i was pregnant, and have about 3.5k in the account.

his father, my fiance, had a separate account for luke and has told me he was doing the £10 a week since we started the accounts. i recently found out the account he has for luke only has a couple hundred in it. my fiance earns less than me but more than my ex. if my ex can afford £10 a week routinely, when he has nearly identical spending habits to me and my fiance but lives alone and therefore pays for rent/bills in full, and my fiance earns more than my ex, there is no reason my fiance should not have been able to make the £10 payments each week (i earn the most of all 3 of us, followed by my fiance, followed by ex). my fiance said he ""forgot"" and asked me to redistribute the contents of lucy's fund to make up for the money missing from luke's. i said fuck no.

luke's account is around 3k less than it should be. we have a wedding fund that contains a little over 2k of mine and my fiance's combined money. we don't want a huge wedding but we do want a really nice honeymoon where we can just go away for a week and not worry about money while we're there or returning.

my fiance says that he doesn't have the money to replace the 3k luke is missing all at once. i have said that i want to take the wedding fund as it currently stands and deposit the lot into the savings account i control that is meant for luke. i would not be doing this if my fiance had not 1) lied for around 7 years about saving for our son, 2) claimed he did not have the money to replace it, 3) suggested i take money from my daughter, saved up with help from my ex, to fix my fiance's mistake. i also said that i want him to set up a direct deposit of £10 to the account that only i control each week. i will not budge on any of this as we agreed years ago now that this was a good idea and that it was important to invest in our son's future, and he has lied to me for 7 years now about making that investment.

aita?

&#x200b;

for people asking why this is so urgent to me: it's not the end of the world if the full amount isn't in luke's account any time soon, as the plan was always to give each kid the total in the account when they were 18/moving out, but my fiance says he can't afford to repay the money in bulk or multiple installments and if he keeps on not paying, then when lucy is 18 she'll have 19-20 grand, and when luke is 18 he'll get closer to 10k from just me. while i don't doubt he'd be grateful for whatever he gets, he'd get half of what lucy will if my fiance doesn't make up the difference.

&#x200b;

update:

i asked him again why he didn't have the money. he said he just didn't. i asked him to bring up his bank statement, or payslip, or anything that shows how much money he has (bearing in mind he was last paid on the 28th and today is the 30th). he refused. i told him that if we were combining finances in any way i should be able to see where his money is going. he responded that i wasn't showing him my financial information, so i pulled up my banking app so he could see my own balance and transaction history. he then showed me his last statement, which his bank emailed him today. we had a fight and he's staying in a hotel tonight, which it turns out he can more than afford. he has nearly 60k in his personal current account and savings accounts, presumably meant solely for himself.

i cannot see us getting married after this. not ever. it's not just the trust issue, but also that he, knowing he had nearly 60k in savings, decided that it was okay to try and guilt trip me into taking money meant for my daughter to fix it for him.",3
"if i got paternity tests done behind my wife's back?. my wife and i are both chinese and have 3 kids together.

honestly once you see it you can't unsee it and it's driving me crazy. i want to get a paternity test done behind my wife's back on the youngest (that looks the most mixed) just for piece of mind.

"aitah for telling my best friend i wouldn't make the same gift i made for him for all his family members?. i'm a woodworker on the side, i made my best friend a wooden american flag because he said he would love one. only charged him cost of materials and shipping cost around $20. he then asked me to make another flag for a gift for his mom. i still gave it to him for cheap because growing up i was close with his family, but now he asked me to make the same flags for 5 other people in his family and one coworker. keep in mind i sell these size flags for $150 and he assumed this time it would still be $20 each flag. i promptly told him i can't do that cost anymore, it was only really a deal for him because he is my best friend and i agreed to it the second time bc it was for his mom but now these are for people i don't even no. told him i'm sorry but it's not gonna happen. he responded ""oh, ok..."" and it's been weird ever since, really short. should i have just done it and not risk ruining our friendship?

update: followed some advice on here and let him know i'm not upset but broke down what all goes into it. said there aren't any hard feelings but just wanted him to know why i said what i said. i'll update with his response.

update #2: he did give an apology of sorts. said he thought that getting my flags out to different people would help more people see my products which could lead to more revenue. i told him i appreciate that but i currently stay busy enough without it and that i wouldn't mind giving him 50% off only bc we're boys but this would be the last time. he said he didn't mean for it to come across the way it did. idk i still feel like it isn't resolved, we're going out for beers this weekend. going to get him to understand my side of things.

final update: he sent me a random message last night profusely apologizing. apparently he was talking to his wife and she tore into him and was upset he would do that haha he just sent a paypal payment for 5 flags at full price. glad it all worked out, i'm going to make him something customized as a thank you for the business. thank you all for the advice. ✌🏻",3
"if i break the deal i made with my wife that she gets to name our male children, because she wants to name our son lannister of the got lannisters?. when we got married, my wife and i made a deal that she gets to name our male children while i get to name the females. our first child is a girl and i named her. our second child is a boy, so my wife should be the one to name him. however, when she told me that she wanted to name our son lannister after her favorite game of thrones family, i put my foot down.

i'd have no problem if she wanted to name our dog lannister, but this is our son. i asked her if she really wanted him to be named after a family of villains, but she just reminded me of our deal. she said she liked the lannisters and it was her turn to name our child, so he would be named lannister. we've had this conversation countless times and she refuses to budge.

the birth will be a c-section and i'm seriously considering filling in the paper work myself while she's still out. i know this might sound unfair to my wife given our deal, but wouldn't it be more unfair to my son if he was named after a family of power grabbing incestuous wine guzzling villains?

edit: she does not want a middle name. she wants his name to be just lannister ourlastname.

edit 2: the lannister motto is 'hear me roar'. the line 'a lannister always pays his debts' is just a common saying.

edit 3: no, our daughter's name is not daenerys. it's margaery.

"for correcting my cousin publically over her claiming no one in the family had ever been to university before her child?. the title probably gives 90% of the information, but i'll provide a bit more context.

i, along with my brother, just graduated from university. my first cousin once removed (aged 18) is just about to start university after the summer. my cousin, the child's mother, just posted a long, congratulatory post on facebook (she just had her offer bumped up to an unconditional place). in this post, she went on and on about how child will be the first in the whole wider family to go to university. she listed off how her and her husband's parents, aunts and uncles (including my dad, the cousin's uncle) and all their kids haven't been able to attend university, and how her child will start a new generation of university attendees.

i don't know whether she was playing dumb or had just had a brain fart, but she knows that both myself and my brother just graduated from university. i would have given her the benefit of the doubt for just meaning the 'adults' in the family hadn't been into further study (my dad was born 10 years after his next youngest siblings, which is why i have cousins 20ish years older than me, and a 17 year old first cousin once removed), but since she name-checked and tagged us in with everyone else, it felt like it was deliberate.

i replied congratulating my second cousin, phrasing a second part of the comment as 'so great to see another surname starting their next stage in life, just after brother and i graduate from our universities!', to politely remind her that her bold claims were false. a little while later i got a message from my aunt, my cousin's mother, asking me to remove the comment since cousin was embarrassed and felt like i was trying to one-up her (even though that's exactly what the tone of her post was).

i haven't yet removed the comment, but woke up feeling pretty asshole-ish, and probably will remove the comment later on. just how much am i in the wrong?

edit: thanks for the advice everyone, we've had to pander to my cousin before over things, so i need to learn to stand up for myself. also i know i messed up in correctly labelling who everyone is, the person going to university soon is my first cousin once removed, and her mum is my cousin. i also got a pronoun wrong at some point too, my brother and i were the people who graduated a few weeks ago. finally, to everyone saying my profile picture should be me in my gown, it already was!!

2nd edit: i know i got the proper name for my first cousin once removed wrong!! i didn't want to change it in the post since i've seen so many times about how changing posts automatically means you're a liar and karma-seeker, but every pm saying 'just so you know...' is slowly breaking my soul! again, apologies, family tree labels are my achille's heel apparently!",3
"for telling my friend the real reason i don't like her kid is that he stinks?. i've asked my friends, and they are genuinely divided, so i thought to ask reddit. i (31f) am childfree, and i work with chloe (40?f). we've become good friends over the past year or so, and we hang out most weekends. we are both into knitting and wine, and we are both really chill.

ideal friendship, right? well, she has a 15 y/o son (braden), who is really unclean. he stinks like rotting meat and bo, and he also has this awful metallic odor that makes me gag. i know it's not a neglect issue, because chloe's younger daughter (11f) has never stunk. lately, i haven't even wanted to go over to chloe's, and i don't want to invite her to my house in case she brings her son. 

lady week was the last straw. we decided to go to the craft store together, and braden wanted to come. i drove them there, and my upholstery stank for a good three days after. the next day at work, chloe asked if i wanted to come over for dinner, and i had to tell her no. she really pushed me for a reason, and i told her her son smells like ass and i basically can't be around him until he works on his cleanliness. she sent me a text later (pasted here): ""hi yall-need-weed, the things you said about braden were really uncalled for and i don't want you to talk about my kids in a bad way. i am a good mom. don't talk to me until you apologize.""

aita? should i apologize?

edit for more info: yes, i did unfortunately phrase it that way. we both cuss a lot, but i definitely could've been gentler. 

no, i won't be calling the authorities on chloe. their house is clean, he has access to washer/ dryer/ shower, this kid just inexplicably reeks.

yes, braden comes with his mom to my house a lot. he doesn't really have friends or out of school activities, and he likes some of the gaming systems i have.

edit 2: no, i'm not one of those childfree people who hates kids. i'm mainly childfree because i like the freedom, and i've never really had a maternal instinct. 

also, ""lady week"" was a typo - i meant ""last week"". fat fingers ftw!",3
"for shutting down ""black"" names because i think it'll make life harder on my kids?. my husband and i are having a baby. i'm mixed race, half black and half white. my husband is black. 

we don't know the gender yet but my husband prefers names that most people would call black names for boys. names like trayvon, devonte, marquis, etc. 

i grew up with a name that is tied to black culture and hated it for most of my life. i go by a shortened form of my name professionally (i.e dee for denaisha) because i have seen how people react to my government name. i am sure i have been passed up for jobs because of how people perceive my name. 

my husband has a name more commonly used for white boys (i.e jake). he wants a strong black name for our son because he never had that and believes that giving him a ""white"" name to avoid racism isn't helping anyone. i don't disagree but don't want to use our son as a test dummy to change that. 

this has become a battle. i know that we both need to agree on a baby name but for writing off all black names?",3
"because i'm furious that my sil tattooed my kids' names on her body?. *edit/info for clarification: i didn't cancel the vacation and won't. it just makes me want to not see her. 

i  think it's disturbing that my sister-in-law, who has a long-distance, limited relationship with our children, had their names tattooed on her arm. she did not ask us how we felt, just posted a picture on social media once it was done.
she has no children of her own, but is still in her child-bearing years. she is not a close beloved aunt of my children- they see her once a year and talk to her briefly on holidays. they never talk about her or ask about her between those times. they like her well enough, but she likes to lecture them and attempt to parent them, so a little of her goes a long way. 

she is going to expect us to all oooh and ahh about this tattoo. i have nothing nice to say. i am not flattered, i feel violated. i feel like it glorifies tattoos (something neither i or their father have, though this isn't about tattoos in general-it's about tattoos of my kids' names. to each their own on tattoos). more importantly, it glorifies her relationship with our kids. she barely knows them, and doesn't spend time with them when we do visit. on our last visit, she sent our kids to mcdonalds with her friend and didn't join them. she later used a photo the friend took of my sons eating, and posted it as if she had been there. it's crazy. instead of the cost of a tattoo (this tattoo is huge btw), how about a plane ticket to visit the children you claim to love so much? she talks about my children taking care of her when she's in a nursing home... why would they? they will be busy with their own families, and taking care of their parents!

i was so mad when i saw the tattoo that i told my husband i wanted to cancel our upcoming vacation to see her (and their grandparents). i have been taking my anger out on him, which is probably unfair but i feel his lack of communication with them leads to this kind of crazy. because i think tattooing my kids' names on her body is weird? am i supposed to feel flattered? i feel like if anyone is going to tattoo my kids' names on their body is should be me or my husband!",3
"for not punishing my daughter the way my boyfriend would have liked?. today my boyfriend and 4yo daughter went to get a haircut together. my boyfriend has beautiful curls that i adore and he lets it grow pretty long. it never gets length it gets more and more curly. this time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. my daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.

bf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. we weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. when my daughter saw it she giggled and said ""you look silly!""

we were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and i told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. i told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, ""oh yeah, oopsie,"" then turned to him and said, ""i'm sorry (bf's name) i just think you look silly with no curly curls. i'm sorry for laughing.""

i thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said ""way too fucking rude, i'm going outside."" i asked him what? but he just went outside, and i looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. he then comes back and says ""outside. now."" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her nintendo 2ds away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. i told him no, because she already apologized and i didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. he ended up leaving us when i went back inside.

i wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. we live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. i'm 4 months pregnant and i have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when i'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. he knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. he had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, i found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. our socks and shoes were soaked and i kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. he eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. am i the asshole?

tldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. wanted me to give her what i think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when i didn't agree.",3
"for being angry at my sister for not attending our fathers funeral because of his criminal history.. my father died right before new years. he passed away from natural causes while incarcerated and serving a life sentence. his next parole hearing was in less than a year but he suffered from lung cancer (smoker) and he also had a hip injury last october which at 70 can lead to complications.

my father was a provider to a family of three kids, my mother never had to work. he paid for my sisters wedding. he paid for my brothers braces and dental work all out of pocket. at home i would say that he was kind to us 70% of the time.

however, my father was also a semi famous in our local area (in the late 80's and early 90's) as a murderer. he has now paid his due to society.

my sister (the one who got her wedding paid for) refused to attend his funeral, even though both me and my elderly mother asked. she says that our father was just a monster and that she doesnt want to participate in it. 

i feel very angry about this. i realize she is an adult but i also feel like she is being childish and over dramatic and extremely hurtful to not just me but my elderly mother who has lost the will to live.

i want to tell her to give back the money the monster paid for your wedding since you think that. aita.",3
"for telling my best friend ""are you eating your burger with a fork because you don't like black people touching your food?"" or did i say it in front of the wrong group of people?. some back story. i'm white, my best friend since middle school is a black dude named rob. i'm not a white guy who says ""i have lots of black friends"" because i don't, but rob and i have been thick as thieves since we went to jr nationals for wrestling. i literally love the guy like a brother.

we are in second semester of freshman year at our state university. since we both hope to apply to professional grad schools, we've been searching around for community service groups in order to make contacts, get experience and maybe even help the community. we both volunteered for a veterans service organization where we go around and make sure that elderly veterans have thier basic services covered and aren't living in a dirty house. so far it's been kind of a waste of time because everyone we check has thier shit together and seem to resent us as busy bodies. whatever, the leader of this group thinks she's saving the world and rob and i are gong to stick it out to spring break and then find something else.

so the group had this dinner on wednesday night at a restaurant and we went because, why not free food. i have no idea what robs deal was but i looked across the table and rob was cutting and eating his hamburger with a knife and fork. i about died laughing because it looked so ridiculous and i had no idea what he was doing and i've eaten meals with him thousands of times and i've never seen him do such a thing. it was hysterically funny.

so i looked at him and i said ""hey rob are you eating your burger with a fork because you don't like black people touching your food?""  rob literally laughed so hard that he coughed up the piece in had in his mouth. we say stuff like this to each other all the time. 

but the reaction from everyone else was the most ridiculous ""clutch the pearls"" shocked white people reaction you've ever seen. i may as well have shot rob in the face. i was scolded by the head of of the volunteer group in person, while literally every other person present came over to rob to make sure he was ""ok.""  i knew i fucked up but as we were leaving we got a huge laugh about it and rob told me that some of the cuter volunteer chicks might actually feel sorry for him enough to have sex with him. i thought it was over and done with.

well yesterday director lady sent out a group email talking about the ""horrors of racism"" and how words have power and how racism must be ripped out by its roots wherever we see it and at the end she said ""u/monsterof will be apologizing to the entire group at friday's meeting."" not apologizing to rob who my joke was directed towards...but apparently to the group of angry white peoples who were sleepless over the mean words (not directed at them) i said to my best friend ok the planet.

again, rob and i got a big laugh but i'm really pissed she said i would be apologizing when i hadn't even been consulted yet. i think i should just quit and leave her hanging. rob wants me to get up there and make a mockery of her apology but i don't even want to do that. 

not necessarily looking for advice because i have until 3 when the meeting starts, but am looking for am i the asshole or not?


edit: well group meeting came and went. they didn't want to allow rob into the meeting to hear the apology lest he have to hear the offending words again or some such absolute horseshit, rob's a pretty chill dude but i think that really bothered him. we didn't make a huge scene like i guess we could of, we both basically said ""no thank you"" and we'll take our services elsewhere. rob says hello...",3
"for refusing to share my 4 seat table with 2 complete strangers at a restaurant?. so i was recently having lunch with a friend and we had decided to try a restaurant that neither of us had been to.  we had reserved a table but when we arrived, the waitress took us to a 4 person table. i told her that we only had made a reservation for 2 people, she said that this was the only table that they had available for us. 

the table was a small rectangular table, with 2 chairs on each of the longer sides, with one of the shorter sides against a wall. we sat facing one another, leaving an empty chair next to us on either side. 

anyway, about half way into our meal, the waitress comes up to us with 2 other people behind her and asks us if we wouldn't mind sharing our table with these 2 other people. 

at first i was a bit taken aback, and really felt obliged to say 'yes' because she was standing there with these 2 other customers. but my thinking was that we had made a reservation, we hadn't been told that this table would require us to share, we were already into our meals and no effort was made to discreetly inform us of this request or explain the situation. so i said (as politely as possible) that we were in the middle of our meal and would prefer not to share the table. i know this was taking a stand, but my view was that she had made no effort to be fair to us in this situation so why should i bend over backwards and ruin our meal by sharing a small 4 person table with 2 other strangers.

the waitress looked at me as if i had been incredibly rude and then proceeded to apologise to the other 2 people right in front of me saying something like: 'i'm so sorry but unfortunately they are unwilling to share their table we will have to find another place for you. i'm so sorry for the inconvenience'  (this was despite the fact that they had clearly heard me and were a little uncomfortable with the situation themselves). 

after this whole debacle, we were treated quite poorly by the waitress (she didn't top up the water, took a long time getting the cheque etc).

afterwards my friend told me that i should have just agreed to share the table and shouldn't have been so un-accommodating. but the way i see it, we should not have been put in this position by the waitress. if they had a policy of sharing tables (regardless of whether or not someone has made a reservation), then we should have been warned before we sat down.

am i the asshole for pushing back on the waitress' request and refusing to share our table?

tldr
we had a reservation for 2 people at a restaurant, but were sat at a small 4 person table when we arrived. half way through our meal, a waitress interrupted our meal (with 2 other customers)  and asked us if we could share our table - without any explanation as to why we were being asked. i politely said that we were half way through our meal and would prefer not to share. this was not taken well by the waitress and we were treated rather coldly after this encounter.

"if i asked the family next to us at a restaurant to turn their children's phones down?. we are at a beef o' brady's and the family next to us has 2 aged 5 to 7 children. i have 2 children myself 8 and 11. they are on games and youtube but they are blasting it. my bf says i should just ""stay in my lane"" eat our food and go. i have no intention of being rude to them just asking if they would kind turning the phones down a bit.

update: so i turned to them politely and related having small kiddos needing to be occupied and asked if the volume could just be a bit lower and dad actually made them get off them and have dinner together. now they're talking about their pee-wee football and it's adorable. thanks reddit! bf was irked with me initially but that's died down now also.",3
"for changing my wife's clothing sizes without telling her?. my wife has gained some weight over the last year, and keeps beating herself up over it. she's always sadly talking about her sizes and calling herself too big. she lost her excitement with shopping and a few months ago i guess i made a step to change that.

she's always asking me to get things for her while she's in the dressing room, new sizes etc. she told me to get a pair of jean shorts for her in a size 6 (this size is too small for her now by a lot. she's kind of in denial about this and always asks for a size 6 and then gets very upset when it won't fit at all. she's more of a size 10 or 12 now. )

i don't know... i got a bigger size and changed the sticker on the jeans so it said size 6. when it fit she was so happy and kept showing me and saying she's so proud. she said she must have lost weight but doesn't know what she did. she bought them feeling very confident with herself. when we got home, i cut the tag off the shorts. 

i didn't mean to but a few times after that i did it again. i guess it was part wanting to see my wife happy and part not knowing how to deal with the same meltdown happening every time. she looks really beautiful even if she gained some weight. i kept doing this and only recently did she realize that the tags on her clothes are missing. she asked me about it and i said i didn't know, maybe the store doesn't use them, but she googled the store and proved they did. 

i had to come clean and now she's furious. she keeps saying i'm an asshole and treating her like an idiot, lied to her, stuff like that. my heart is broken too. we haven't spoken in days.

aita?

edit: i can't believe this became so big and i feel way too overwhelmed. hard for me not to delete the post because some people are being very cruel to me and sometimes also to my wife. insulting her doesn't make me feel better and i don't know i feel like i understand the mistake i made but not everything i'm seeing here helped me get there. since this became so big i'll try to update what happens.",3
"for demanding that my 15 year old son's girlfriend get a paternity test for their alleged baby.. one more edit: wow this got big. so we've been doing a lot of research over night (obviously i haven't slept well) and found how non invasive the procedure could be, and the results come back in a week or so. we're gonna go to the girls parents with this information and try to explain why it's important for all of us to know. thank you all for your input, i'll try and post an update when i know more. also, as a side note, i wouldn't consider myself overly controlling or a ""helicopter parent"". as i said, my son knows about safe sex, knows sex is normal, and has even asked my husband for condoms in the past, as we told him he should do whenever he needed to. the constant supervision we kept them under only applies to what happens in our house, and i don't think that's an outlandish rule. just because we're sex positive doesn't mean we're celebratory or encouraging of it. 

it's almost comical that this of all things would be what made me get a reddit account, even more comical that i'm turning to the internet for input, but i just wanna put it out there that i'm set in my thinking. i just wanna know if i'm an asshole for it. 

my 15 year old son came to my husband and i last week, telling us that his girlfriend is 7 months pregnant. as someone who became a mother very young, i am devastated and so deeply disappointed. they've been together for about a year, but we always thought it was a kids thing, nothing harmless. regardless, when under our watch, we kept them under constant supervision, so this was all a shock. we know the girls parents and believed we were all on the same page about our kids. 

turns out we were wrong. when we called them, they spun some bullshit about how their daughter had already told us, basically placing the blame on their child for us not knowing she's been pregnant for seven months. on top of this, they've only known for about a month or two meaning she's had basically no prenatal care. 

we were trying to figure out what our next steps should be, so i called my older brother. not wanting him to keep a secret from his family, i told him i'd individually call his wife and two daughters to tell them myself. when i called the youngest one, 16, who is close to my son, her first reaction was ""i wonder if it's even his.""

upon hearing this, i immediately questioned my son, who then informed me of their very... colorful relationship. she's apparently a serial cheater, even though i didn't even think that was a factor in a 15yo's relationship. i've never felt like such a bad mother listening to all that was going on in my sons life that i didn't know about, knowing he's never trusted me enough 

after this i contacted the parents of his girlfriend, and as gently as i could, informed them that we wanted a paternity test done. they flipped, they were pissed about what i was accusing their daughter of, and saying the trauma of even bringing that up to her is too much for a heavily pregnant child. while i might agree, this is my child's life that's gonna be deeply impacted too. 

so my husband and i decided we're gonna keep trying to get a paternity test done no matter what it takes. for demanding this? am i being unreasonable? as bad of a parent as i feel like i am right now for letting this happen, i feel i'm no where near as bad as the girls parents...

edit: just to clarify, weve gone over this with my son and he's on board and understands why a paternity test is important.

another edit: we have definitely discussed safe sex with our son, as i said i was a very young mother and it was important to me to make sure they're educated. i in no way blame the girl, i just want to protect my son.",3
"for refusing to return the jeans i stole from the girl who i caught in bed with my boyfriend (ex)?. brand new account and throwaway for you guys. 

so tuesday of last week i made my now ex-boyfriend dinner. he's a paleo junkie and i really wanted to impress him so i skipped class to slice fennel with a razor blade in order to garnish the strip steak i made for him. yeah i really, really (really) loved him. i decided it would be easier to cook the steak in his kitchen so i went over to his place early (i have a code and open invite). i walked in to find half eaten dominoes pizza on the counter (remember i sliced fennel with a razor blade because he's so ""dedicated"" to paleo) and noises coming from the bedroom. 

i walked in and he was absolutely plowing a good looking girl with a spectacular body. fuck me for not eating pizza to impress him. i stood there in shock. she saw me over his shoulder first and started tapping furiously for him to get off. he turned around and hit me with the oh so classic ""this isn't what it looks like!"" 

i was speechless and had no idea what to do but i saw her clothes hanging over his desk chair. because apparently i'm a petty b!tch, the only thing i could think was i wanted her to have leave his apartment without pants. i don't know, it made sense at the time. 

he came after me begging me not to overreact, i didn't say a word and took off to my car. in the days since he's gone from begging me to ""be reasonable,"" to begging me not to break up with him and promising he'll never do it again.

the thing is, i love these jeans. yes as a trophy of me being petty and at least ruining something of hers like she had he tag teamed to ruin my heart and self esteem. but they are also a super expensive brand, they look really good on me and i like wearing them. 

so ex has gone from begging me to get back together with him to saying that me keeping the jeans is causing him ""real problems."" i don't give a slight shit about his problems but i sort of feel bad about keeping this girl's clothes. 

so i'm asking...i know i'm petty...but am i an asshole?

edit: the plot thickens, i just woke up to following text:

""hi, alyssa. this is the weirdest text i've ever written. i'm madison and i was the girl in aiden's room last week. i'm so, so, so sorry, i don't know how to say it other than that. the look on your face will haunt me for the rest of my life. please believe me when i say i didn't know he had a girlfriend. i would have never been there had i known. you have every reason not to care, but this last year has been so hard for me, my dad died of pancreatic cancer in december and i'm struggling so hard and find myself making bad choice after bad choice which i how came to be in aiden's room. the pants you have are the ones i bought the day before my dad died, he gave me ""permission"" to go treat myself and it's the last time i ever heard him call me by his pet name as in ""pumpkin, please don't be afraid to get you want, buy your jeans."" it would mean the world to me if you returned them to me. i know you've been hurt and i feel for you and i think aiden is pure scum, all i want from him is getting my pants back. please find it in your heart to return them to him or contact me directly. thank you so much, madison.""

so i guess i have to give them back...i'm in tears here.

edit 2: just woke aiden up at 5:45 (on org chem test day too...fuck him) with ""what's madison's last name?"" he tried to give me the ""who's madison?"" at first but then told him she texted me. he tried to talk me out of it but then relented so he could go back to sleep. so i looked her up on facebook and it's pretty bare but she does have a ""instamodel"" sister who has all sorts of sad posts with like her holding her dads hand while has iv and then a somewhat touching insta memorial to her dad...so i'm thinking the text is not a lie.

edit3: i just texted back and forth with her, we're meeting at starbucks at 9.


edit4: (wednesday evening—had tried to do a new post but mods suggested i just edit the op...so this is a cut and paste. hope it makes sense i'm just starting on my second bottle of skinny girl so hope this makes sense) so wow, that first post got a ton of heat and i'm so thankful, really for the chance to get some input but also because a lot of you are very, very funny and i appreciated the laughs. i don't know what the overall verdict was but i'm ok to think i was being an asshole in keeping the jeans.

so like many of you saw, the girl (madison) texted me overnight telling me about why the jeans were important to her and asking if i would give them back. we texted back and forth a few times this morning and agreed we'd meet at the starbucks by campus so i could return them. i got there and instantly recognized her and she got up and gave me a hug which i thought was very sweet (i'm a hugger too) and she had bought me like three different varieties of venti drinks to make sure she got one i liked (or as she admitted later, she was so nervous she didn't know what to do) which i also thought was very cool. i wasn't sure whether or not i even really wanted to talk with her but the coffee was enough entre to get me to sit down. i handed her the jeans and she was very thankful and again explained the story about her dad and teared up. lots of people told me not to believe her but if she's lying, she's a sociopath because i could tell she was really upset by it. i did my best to comfort her which i hope was well received.

so as we got past that the only things i wanted to know were: how long had she known aiden, did she know about me being his girlfriend and was she hoping to continue seeing him. she said they met when he and some friends went to her restaurant maybe a month ago and had been texting back and forth ever since, she said last tuesday was the first time they'd met in person and she said she swore to god she didn't know he had a girlfriend. she said after i showed up tuesday she was so disgusted she got dressed in her spare clothes (fat lot of good it did me to steal her jeans if my plan was to embarrass her) and left and didn't even process that her special jeans were gone until about a day later when she stared bugging him to get them back but she had no interest in seeing him. she said she was so frustrated with him stonewalling her had stopped by to get my number directly but he wouldn't even do that so she got it from his neighbor who happened to hear them arguing...she'd had my number since sunday but was too nervous to text until yesterday.

lots more happened and i can expand more in the comments but i think i'm running out of room...anyways so our plan is she is not going to tell him that i gave her the jeans back and start to demand he pay for them or buy her a new pair. when he does, she'll just give me the money or the jeans and then we'll give him the old...""thanks for the jeans but us adults already worked it out...toodles."" yes we are deceiving him but we both agree he deserves it.
like i said lots more details but running into the 3000 character limit so i can say more if anyone is interested. thank you for being so invested in my life. i've felt pretty rejected since this all went down and will have a hole in my heart for a long time...the kindness of internet strangers really, really helped for a few hours",3
"for telling my wife i will divorce her if she continues to try to raise our son as muslim?. me and my wife have been married two years. she is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. i am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. she continued to put on a front for her muslim father.

her family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. that is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.

my wife lives with me. we agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. she agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. her family did not show up to our wedding.

now that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. i refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.

so im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? no sir. my father in law has a gross control over my wife.

she is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. when she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.

he is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. she is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. however i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.

he is my son too, and hes a baby. i have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. my father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. he acts like i am not the boys father.

i flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.

edit: seems like theres a lot of confusion about my wifes faith and her relationship with her family.. heres a story that might clear things up.

my wife and myself were at the beach. having fun, trying to surf. she was wearing a very sexy two piece bikini. she takes selfies of herself, and posts them online where she thinks her family cant see. harmless fun.

her brother somehow sees, and rudely tells her that shes disgracing her family. not even kidding. i tell him to lay off her, and he threatens to attack me. her brother is 17.

the father not only knew about this, but liked the brothers posts. needless to say my wife ended up in tears and we haven't gone to the beach since. these are her family.

edit 2: post locked which is fine. theres obviously been enough.

to all those pming saying that im a racist troll and that the mods ""exposed"" me, i messaged them and they have no evidence. that is just one mods (incorrect) opinion that they decided to sticky for whatever reason. i told them that it was causing confusion and sending harassment my way, they dont seem to care.

they also muted me for even asking so theres that.

it is simply their opinion, which is fine to have. it is nothing more than that.

as an update i realize i was over the line to lay down an ultimatum but i dont know what to do or where to go from here. im stuck. thats about it.",3
"for forcing a 6 year old kid to be separated from her parent on a flight?. title kinda sounds fucked up but hear me out lol

i recently was on an international flight and i always try to snag the window seat so i can sleep. a woman was seated next to me and asked if i could give up my seat since it turned out that her 6 year old was apparently seated in the row across. i tried to be nice about it and said, ""sorry, but i specifically chose this seat and i don't really want to give it up, i've been traveling for hours.""

the woman's response was, ""well so have we! imagine traveling with an overtired kindergartener who now won't be able to sleep since she can't sit by her mom!"" she made me look like an asshole in front of the other people on the flight, and i felt bad since it was a little kid. i agree that it probably sucks to be traveling with a little kid, but for not giving up my seat?

edit:

1. i was seated in the window seat, the woman was in the middle seat next to me, and another passenger was in the aisle seat next to her. 6 year old kid was across in the next row over in the aisle seat. since the mother and the kid were only one seat away from each other, it wasn't so much an issue of not being seated next to each other, but more that the mom wanted her kid to have the window seat so she could sleep
2. this wasn't an issue of separation and the kid being scared. her mom was one seat away. this was an issue of wanting the seat for her kid just so she could sleep
3. for those asking duration of the flight: 6 hours
4. for those asking ""why didn't she ask the other person in the aisle seat?"" because she specifically wanted the window seat for her child",3
"for rejecting a girl as revenge?. so, to start off, maybe, it was a bit petty of me tbh. anyway, i asked this girl clara out on a date about a year ago. i was a completely different person then, and she turned me down. it stung like hell, but it did encourage me to better myself. since then i've gotten in better shape, became more confident and generally i've had more luck with girls. i still never forgot what made me improve though, and that will always be a shitty memory.

anyway, me and a few friends i've made since last year went out to a gathering. i'm still fairly new in their circle, and surprise! clara was there. i think she recognized me but i wasn't sure. me and her hit it off, and at the end of the night we had a date planned. the date went pretty well and we went on our second one last friday.

after this i went home and thought about where to go next, and i realized i couldn't really forgive her. so, she hit me up asking if we were going out again, and i sort of make a joke of it, blew it off and put her on mute. i haven't responded since then, and our mutual friends say she's been pretty upset, since she gets attached to people quickly, but the revenge i got was so sweet! 

but, maybe i was an asshole though, what does reddit think?",3
"for taking away my niece's flower girl duty the day of the wedding?. got married last weekend and had a lovely day, but had some commotion early on the wedding day. 

for flower girl, we had a choice between my two nieces, amber and katie. they're both eight and it was a tough decision. unfortunately for my perfect day i felt shallow and since amber has more of a typical angelic ''cute'' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) i picked her. her parents also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment her school did. 

during the wedding prep katie and her dad (my brother) kept telling me that amber had been bullying her about the fact she didn't get the job. the girls have never liked each other for reasons i don't know. i didn't pay too much mind to it since i was too caught up in myself.

on the wedding morning i got to witness the bullying myself and it was pretty cruel. amber (and keep in mind this is an eight year old child) told katie that she'd never get married because she's too ugly. i could imagine how upsetting this would be for a child and i made amber apologise and also took away the flower girl job and gave it to katie. amber was crying throughout the wedding day, and for the past days i haven't heard anything from her dad my other brother. 

my husband and i are going away on our honeymoon on thursday, and i was anxious to get in touch with my brother before we leave. he finally called me and was extremely angry at me for taking the job away from his daughter. he said amber has been crying the past two days and felt really humiliated, and was really looking forward to the job. 

as someone who was bullied myself growing up, it felt like the right thing to do after amber's behaviour towards katie. i can't imagine how upsetting those comments would be, and at that point katie, who had never been anything other than well behaved deserved it more than amber.",3
"for leaving my own surprise party?. i (17f) have been struggling with some depression after my dad passed. i spend about a year isolated, never leaving my room, just laying in bed all day miserable. i started going to therapy and working two days a week, but the moment i come home i will still crawl right into bed. i just have no energy. 

my 17th birthday was a few days ago and my mom was asking if i wanted a party, she thought it would be good for me. i told her several times that no, i don't want a party, pretending to be totally fine and happy is exhausting. especially with that many people around. 

but when i came back from work and opened the door, the house was filled with people. (maybe 10% family i'm not close to and 90% my moms friends). i didn't know what to do so i walked back out again, i grabbed a slice of pizza somewhere and walked around the park, hoping that when i came back they would be gone. 

while at the park my phone blew up with texts from my family and mom, that i was ungrateful and spoiled and didn't deserve nice things they tried to do. 

i came home about two hours after i left the party, my mom was super pissed. i tried to explain but she thinks it's just excuses. 


was i the asshole? my mom is still not speaking to me, and i do feel bad that she went though all that effort for nothing.



edit: my mom and dad divorced a few years back if that matters. and i do have friends that my mom knows, but none of them were invited.


edit 2: 

i'm already in therapy and its helping.

 this wasn't meant as a validation post, your parent and family telling you you're wrong will make you doubt yourself. 

and i was dead on my feet, i had just worked 9 hours and i just wanted to sleep. i'm an introvert so social interactions already cost a lot of energy, so i couldn't have just 'faked in for an hour'

pretending to be fine when you're not takes a lot of energy, and i couldn't at that point.

"for calling my fat friend fat after she called me a twig?. i am very self conscious about my weight. i am very skinny because of my fast metabolism and im very bony. it tears me apart when i hear people calling me a twig. i was eating lunch with some of my friends and the biggest one in the group said ""eat"" when i was throwing out half of my sandwich. i said ""im not hungry"" and she said ""you have to eat, your a twig"" they already know i have a fast metabolism because i told them before about it when they asked why i was so bony. i snapped back and said ""i'd rather be a twig then a whole tree"" and suddenly im the asshole. everyone in my group of friends hate me and i want to know if its my fault.

edit: wow ok i didnt expect this to blow up. now i can say my alt account has more karma then my main. i saw people concerned about my weight. my highschool has lunch very early and i had a big breakfest thats why i wasn't that hungry. i just believed i was skinny because of a fast metabolism because thats what my mom told me but now im starting to believe it might be something else. i appreciate all the tips and concern",3
"for locking the door at my in-laws house overnight?. my in-laws live in a sleepy artsy fartsy town where nothing ever happens. they know all their neighbors, half of the family lives near by. they're the kind of people who are comfortable with anyone coming in or dropping by unannounced just to say hi, show someone something on their phone, etc. it's very full house.

so that being said, they don't lock their door. we've piled into the car to go to the store or other places before and i've said ""do you have the key?"" to be (gently, not meanly) laughed at and had it explained that they don't need to lock the door. 

i'm not comfortable with that, but i didn't say anything. i just moved my travel bag into my car. when we went to get ready for bed, i passed by the door and saw it hadn't been locked. i asked if i should lock up for the night and the family chuckled again. i felt extremely uncomfortable, so for peace of mind, i locked up. 

in the am, fil got up and went to get his paper. he found the door was locked and said ""(my name), did you lock the door?""

i said yeah, very casually. he looked at me like i was crazy. i said i'm just not comfortable with leaving doors unlocked. both of them laughed, and for the rest of the weekend, the jokes continued. things like ""who hurt you?"" and ""what was so bad in your childhood that you can't deal with an unlocked door?"" and ""what do you think was going to happen, someone was going to break in? this isn't (big city we live in).""

we ended up leaving early because my husband was tired of telling them to knock it off. a few days later, my mil posted what was supposed to be a funny thing  on fb and tagged me, saying ""(my name) and husband visited, but dil isn't cut out for that (town) life! she couldn't handle a few unlocked doors and thinks the whole world is out to get her!"" cue the family making fun of me, my upbringing, etc.

i'd finally had enough and posted back: home invasions happen. my best friend's dad was murdered in their home by an intruder when i was 12 years old. forgive me for caring about my safety and infringing on whatever makes you feel superior here.""

she deleted the post and told me i was out of line, it wasn't my place to lock doors in someone's house that wasn't mine, if i didn't feel safe with them, maybe i shouldn't visit anymore. i said sure, husband and i won't visit anymore. she backpedaled and made it clear she meant just me, but i asked why he would drive all the way out there (it's about 5 hours) without me just to be with people who were mean and judgmental about his wife and a locked fucking door? this turned into another big ""you're taking my baby away from me!"" situation.

anyway in relaying the whole story to others, i've had a surprising reaction. am i the asshole for locking a door at night?",3
"for threatening to sue my parents for taking out student loans in my name?. i graduated college 4 years ago and i rarely speak to my mother or father. maybe 2-3 times a year and even then it's only for a few minutes, they refused to let me play sports in high school or have a social life and they've basically cut me out of their lives since i and about 75 other people got a city drinking ticket 7 years ago in college. since i live about 800 miles away, i only go back to my hometown once a year either for thanksgiving or christmas, most years i stay with a friend or at a hotel, last year i stayed with my parents. no way in hell am i going back for either this year.

just about 5 months before i graduated college, my parents bought a boat. i know they got a good deal on it and they have used it a lot. they took it out of the water for the season in early october. i've literally never seen it in person, just pictures from facebook.

last week i had texted my father (first contact since march) and let him know i would be able to make it back for christmas. about a minute later he called and over the course of 5 minutes explained how he and my mother decided since their last child was about through college, they would buy a boat. the only problem was they didn't have the ~$20,000 to buy it.

what was their solution? take out a student loan in my name of course! my mailing address was always their house through college so i was none the wiser. why was my dad telling me about it now 4 years after the fact? because they can't pay it back, they actually never paid any of it back. they kept putting it in forbearance but that ran out early this year. fast forward 7 or 8 missed payments later and my dad tells me the only reason he's telling me now is because he doesn't want me to bring it up at christmas and he knows it's going to default in a month or two. his exact words were ""if you're going to make a big deal about this it's best if you don't come home this year"".

he also said it's ""about $25,000"" is what i would need to pay it off. i hung up and just sat in shock for a couple of minutes. i called my brother yesterday and told him what was happening and that i think i'm going to sue them for whatever it takes to pay off the loan. i still don't know what that amount is yet, i should probably find out by next week. i'm cool with my brother and he's cool with my parents and i'm sure he probably talked to them because this morning i get a text from my mom just saying ""do not sue us"". i texted her back saying she would need to immediately pay off the entire loan and show me proof. she texts back that i need to grow up. obviously i'm not even going to respond to that.

the boat is probably worth half of what they paid for it by now and with the hours they've put on it. i don't know if they have the money or not to pay up immediately if i sue them but i figure i can at least garnish their wages. my other brother called and asked me to hold off a few months before doing anything that it was shitty of them to do that but to give them a chance to start paying if off.

"for not giving up my table (at a restaurant) for a pregnant woman who needed it for accessibility?. two nights ago i was out for dinner with my husband at this new restaurant we've been wanting to try for a while. it's got a michelin star so it's always packed and the restaurant itself is pretty tiny and spans two floors. 

we got a great table on the first floor which is really just a bar, some tiny two person tables, and those standing tables for drinks. we essentially got the only table by the window for actual dining. we got this due to calling nearly a week ahead for reservations. 

anyways nearly half an hour into our meal this visibly pregnant woman and her husband comes in asking for a table. they had a reservation but no request for any specific table so when the hostess starts leading them upstairs to the main dining room the woman says no, she can't go up stairs in her current state (she looks very pregnant). 

long story short, they end up approaching us asking if we'd mind switching tables with them so they could have our ground floor table. my husband is like ok i guess but i simply said no, i called ahead to get this exact table and i want to stay here. the hostess shrugs and the woman and her husband looks pretty ticked off. she rolled her eyes at me and they just left. my husband thinks we should've given up our table. aita?

**edit**: to everyone asking for more details, here's a better breakdown of what happened. 

we had just gotten our starters and were still anticipating 3 more courses (pasta/main/dessert). we had also ordered an expensive bottle of wine so had no intention to rush the evening. the table i reserved was a bit special because it was the only one set in these huge bay windows that's very iconic to this particular restaurant, looks very romantic basically. i had called previously just to ask for this table and was turned down (original date was last weekend but table was taken) but we went midweek instead since we weren't in any rush and thought that window table was especially nice. also the upstairs dining room is sort of grim compared to downstairs (smaller windows, used to be the attic). 

when the other couple came in we didn't notice initially until they started whispering to each other and the hostess while staring at us. eventually the hostess comes over with them in tow asking if we'd switch tables and they'd comp our starters. the pregnant woman tells us they drove over an hour to get here to eat and she can't walk up stairs because of her knees (it was some medical condition i can't remember). my husband and i talked it over and i said no thank you we'd like the stay here if possible. honestly i didn't expect them to just leave the restaurant. i assumed they would make do and just eat at the other smaller bar tables on the ground floor since they were mostly empty at this time.

this is where the couple kind of huffs collectively and the guy said ""seriously?"" under his breath and the woman very exaggeratedly rolled her eyes. i'm like ""whatever"" at this point and we go back to our meal. some waiters come over and offer to piece together some of the smaller bar tables on the ground floor into one large table but i guess they didn't want that (we weren't close enough to hear why). finally our waitress and hostess comes over (couple waits by door) asking if we can finish in ~30 minutes if they rush our order and bring all the food out at once. my husband and i are like ""obviously not we're not going to glug our wine and inhale our food"" and they relent and go tell the couple we're not moving. then the couple leaves.

actually, looking back now it's possible that couple knew people at this restaurant since the hostess/waiters seemed exceptionally frantic when they couldn't get our table and kept apologizing. i remember being kind of annoyed they were acting like that when they basically wanted to kick us out minutes earlier. could be speculation but i wouldn't be surprised if they were important somehow and the restaurant didn't want to piss them off.",3
"update: for wanting to share the hotel room i booked with my girlfriend rather than sleeping with my friend who will go through a break up before our planned trip?. sorry for being a savager, here's the link: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bdrxjd/aita_for_wanting_to_share_the_hotel_room_i_booked/

hello, its been a few months since my last post but i thought that i'd give you an update. so, naturally, i talked to my so the day after i posted this on the subreddit. she recently joined this subreddit so she'll probably recognise this post (if you see this, i love you very much <3). 

i expressed my concerns for the break up and how it would affect our vacation together, specifically the room arrangements and told her of my conversation with my friend. she basically said what you guys did: we have no obligation to rearrange our trip for their comfort if they're going to break up, so i shouldnt feel obligated to give up our room together for that. they, especially my friend, has the responsibility to work out something. we agreed that it's a weird situation overall, but with her support i felt even more confident.

well, my friend and his gf broke up as expected a few weeks after i made the post. i casually confronted my friend some time afterwards. like, ""oh by the way when we talked about you wanting to change the room arrangements. we're not really up for that, so if you can find another option then that'd be swell."" more or less. he took it well and said he understood of course, but his gf ultimately wouldn't be joining us even though all of us said she was welcome to do so and that she could find another room or hotel but it was her choice. we all agreed that it was his responsibility to find another person to join us if he didn't want to pay that much. he took responsibility for it which i really appreciated, but in the end he had to pay the full price. she still had to pay for the plane ticket and the activities we were supposed to go on, but she said it was easy to earn back and didn't hold a grudge. we're still very good friends to this day.

overall, we had a good time on our trip. although our friend was  single and wanted to explore the night life more, me and my partner enjoyed our time together in our hotel room and the public areas, we had a blast! we also connected a bit more with my friend over drinks and fun days. so everything turned out alright in the end. thank you for all the responses that made me realize that i need to work on my confrontation skills and express my boundaries for my own, and my partner's, interests. i'm hoping that this post will encourage others in my shoes to do the same and hopefully come to a solution as friends and adults. be respectful, understanding, and don't forget that we all have issues that we struggle with. best is to encourage growth to strengthen ourselves and our relationships.",3
"for being mad at my husband for having a ""threesome?"". throwaway because some of my friends have reddit too. 


to start my story off, let me give you some background info. i am a woman. my husband is a bisexual male leaning more towards straight, but is still bi. we have only recently gotten married, about 9 months ago. before that we dated for a couple of years. my husband has always wanted to have a threesome with another bi man, as he could please both of us. i wasn't too comfortable with doing this, but last week, i finally agreed. my husband is very in with the lgbtq+ community in our area, so he knew exactly who he wanted to join us right away. we scheduled to have this event partake three days after my agreeing at the friends house, who we will call jim.


now fast forward to four days ago, the day of the threesome. i was very nervous, but my husband was excited to "" finally be able to have a good man in him"" as he said. we got to jim's house, and were brought inside. we had a few drink and then started. i don't want to make this too nsfw but what i will say was that both of them were involved with each other and me in multiple ways. but i guess my husband wanting for men was more than i expected, because after a few minute of foreplay and intercourse, it turned into my husband and jim just having normal sex. i saw what was happening, grabbed my clothes, ran out the house and into my car, and drove away almost in tears. some people might see this as an overreaction, but in my mind, all my husband was doing was cheating on me with another man. i later texted him and told him he could stay at jim's house overnight, he wasn't welcome here. later the next day jim dropped my husband off, who was not apologetic at all. he was mad at me for driving away, saying that he did nothing wrong, and that he just wanted to satisfy his needs. most of our other friends also sided with him, saying that he needs a man every now and then.


so what do you think reddit, for having a ""threesome"" with my husband and his friend?

"for bribing a guy into an arranged marriage?. for background i am a 22 year old woman from a large middle eastern nation. in my culture arranged marriages are quite common amongst the religious population.

i attend a prestigious private university in one of the most populous cities in our region of the world. my family is very well off as my father is the ceo of one of the most successful holdings in our nation. i am studying engineering and in my faculty there is a man who i will refer to as ali. ali is syrian and sought refuge in our country. he came here with his two young sisters and his mother. his father passed away in the syrian war. his family currently lives in a small single bedroom apartment and are supported by my countries government aid. he has a sponsor so he can attend my university.

ali and i are both studying civil engineering. i have been in love with him since grade 1 of university. the problem is he has deep feelings for a syrian girl who also ran away to my country. she doesn't want to be with him as far as i know. since we are nearing graduation, i want to tell him that if he lets her go and chooses to start a relationship with me then him and his family would be financially secure for life. i want to propose this idea to him and his mother. i am not technically persuading him to marry me, but if he does he would be saving his family from ever having to go back to syria. and he would know this. for making this offer?

so we all talked and agreed to do sections as opposed to working together because girl b doesn't have a car and i don't want to do it in school as parking is expensive. so it was decided girl b will do abstract and intro, i will do methods and results (since i didn't really trust them), girl a will do discussion, conclusion, and references.  we all decided what to do and i told them i will keep communication open and email them both findings as i go so they could do their parts. i have been emailing constantly since mid october  (project is due nov 20). i scheduled a meeting on the 13th just to touch bases and see how they are doing.

during the meeting we showed each other the work and omg the abstract and the intro is like written by a high schooler. it seemed like she did it the night before, it barely described what we are trying to do. so i called her out on it and told her i'm doing the heavy lifting and the 2 parts she has are literally the easiest sections. she proceeded to tell us how she's has a part time job and on top of that she is raising a kid and just went on and on how hectic her life is, and then offhandedly insulted me saying because i don't have a job and a kid i wouldn't understand. i get that i wouldn't but university is optional, i don't think you should get a pass simply because your life is ""hectic"" but whatever. so i said fine email me a second draft on saturday the 16th. i just got it today (the 17th) because she said her kid was sick so she had and picked up extra shifts. i read it and it is still lacking (keep in mind i gave her pointers). i think she maybe changed a couple of sentences and then used a thesaurus.

edit:  didn't realize i was coming off as a massive dick. i tried to look at both perspective and unfortunately  yes, i should have probably communicated more. however i think it should also be up to the other person to ask for help as opposed to giving the impression of smooth sailing. i also can't get behind the idea of doing the bare minimum simply because it's not a priority to you, but maybe because i'm not a mom yet i can't fathom what its like so i'm not as empathetic.

"for deciding not to tell my family that the surgery i'm getting will probably kill me?. i'm getting a major surgery done in about three weeks and i was told there's a 60-80% chance it will kill me. it's 60% if i do all the things the surgeon told me to do to prepare for the surgery (take supplements, gain weight fast, lots of protein) and i'm following all the rules. so let's say my chances of dying are 60%. that's not great but not too horrible.

the thing is that i've had this exact surgery before and i came out just fine so my family has no reason to think this time will be any different (aside from the risk involved with any surgery). however for reasons involving my medical condition (tm), this time the surgery is riskier.

my family consists of my older brother (28m) who i (27m) live with and my mom (54f) who lives on the other side of the country. my brother is very protective of me and my mom still acts like i'm her little boy. the only reasons i could think of to tell them would be:

1. give them time to prepare for the possibility of my death. but i don't think this is something they can prepare for. i'm sure they'd just be miserable for the time leading up to the surgery. i don't want that.
2. give us all a chance to make happy memories before the surgery. again i don't think that can happen when we'd only be doing it because i might die soon. it would feel forced and desperate and they would only be pretending to not be miserable and i'd be unhappy because i would know they're miserable.

i'm leaning towards ""ignorance is bliss"" for everyone involved. if i survive, no harm done and all that potential misery would be for nothing. if i die, well that's a risk of any surgery and their final moments with me wouldn't have had that misery. and with my medical condition (tm) it's unlikely i'd make it to retirement age anyway.

but is it right for me to hide something this big, even if it's to spare them pain? what are your thoughts?

edit: the surgery is 100% necessary. i will die without it, but it would take maybe a year or so and be very unpleasant.

edit2: i've already gone over how i'd want my body dealt with the last time i had surgery (donated to science or cremated if science doesn't want it). i have no debts and my brother knows about all my bank accounts.

edit3: i will write letters to them.

edit4: maybe i wasn't very clear about this because a few people have commented about it. i'm not hiding the surgery itself from my family, just how risky it is. they're going to come see me off and we'll say our i love yous and good lucks at the hospital.

edit5: i already have an advanced medical directive from the last time i had this surgery.

and yes i promise to post an update if i survive! you're all very sweet for wishing me well. it turns out reddit isn't as scary as i feared (i just joined and this is my first post).

edit6: thanks to everyone who responded with their thoughts! i honestly don't know what i want anymore. there seems to be no good answer and spending the last 4 hours reading what everyone has said and thinking about my upcoming surgery has left me feeling pretty drained. i'm going to take a break and recharge.

edit7: okay i'm feeling very overwhelmed here. i was only expecting to get 10 comments, maybe 20 at the most. now there's nearly 400 comments. i wrote this post feeling pretty confident of my decision but i wanted to see if anyone out there had a different perspective, another point of view that i hadn't considered. after reading over 100 of these comments i don't know what i should do anymore. i'm feeling guilty for hiding this but i can't see what the right thing to do is. there probably *isn't* a right thing to do.

so many of you have shared their stories and experiences with the death of a loved one. i'm truly sorry you had to go through that and i appreciate your perspectives. i'm going to revisit this in the morning and look at this with fresh eyes.

ps: to all the people who are setting reminders for three weeks (a bit morbid but i understand) you should make it for four weeks. if i survive, i'll need time to recover and get out of the icu before i come back to reddit.",3
"for not bringing my mom with me on vacation because she doesnt give credit where credit is due?. we are from the philippines and my mom is extremely religious. i am a closeted atheist since i was about 13. my mom had quite a tough-ish life due to (mostly) her bad decisions like not being good with money, refusing every good opportunity that came her way because she believed in ""signs from god"" (e.g. someone offered her a substantial amount of money for something she wasn't selling, she prayed and asked god ""if this is a bad decision, let person x come by my house this week"" but person x comes by our house 2-3x a week. while i told her it's a very good decision to sell, since person x comes by anyway she follows her ""sign""). she's a single mom and i am her only child. so i always dreamt of giving her a good life.

i learned to not follow her mistakes, and i suppose this is why i became an atheist. i worked extremely hard because i wanted a different life from that of my mom. 25 yrs later, i became quite successful. bought her a house, a car and an allowance each month. 

she never once thanked me. instead, she thanked god. i ignored this at first, but then she got quite extreme. i mentioned to her that i did work pretty hard to get here, and she says things like ""this is god's reward to me, all those years of following him. i deserve/earned this"" and ""it was through my prayers and faith that he listened and gave you the strength to push through. if you think this was purely because of you, you are sorely mistaken!""

i am going to australia for a holiday, i wanted to take her and she said something like ""praise be to him! he loves me so much, he knew i deserve to have a vacation!"" i don't know why, but it rubbed me the wrong way and told her ""nevermind, i'm going alone."" 

she's upset, asked why and i said that i am so sick and tired of hearing her praise some being for my hard work and love. she said i am being ungrateful and delusional if i think my success was because of ""just me working hard""",3
"changing someone's instagram password for using my email. i got an email that ""my"" account name had been changed. since i didn't have an account under the supposed name i checked it out. 

it wasn't my account so i dm'ed the other person, ""hi it's actually name. do you want to change your email?"" to which he responded, ""no i'm also actually name bitch.""

now this user appeared to be a kid so i decided to use this as a learning opportunity. i changed his password and deleted his recovery phone number. i then gave him a bio which said, ""dm me @my account with your email so i can change it for you.""",3
"for demanding that my girlfriends gymnastics routine be less ""sexy?"". i truly want an honest opinion so i'm going to include all details i can w/in char limit, even ones that aren't flattering to me. 

i've been dating my gf for about a month. honestly i feel much stronger about her than she does me, but i'm hoping she comes around. she is on our university gymnastics team and is an incredible athlete. i went to her meet this afternoon and was freaking shocked to see how much of her floor routine had ""sexual"" elements. she did her routine to ""p'on da replay"" and as an example she crawled on all fours, she shook her ass, she did this thing where she went up and down her body with her finger (including her breasts) and then acted like her finger was sizzling. and during all this, her teammates cheered. i was blown away that this sort of sexuality was not only allowed but encouraged. 

after the meet i told her i didn't think she should do that sort of stuff. she told me that it was normal for gymnastics and that her routine had been worked out for years with coaches and choreographers. i told her it was normal for strippers who danced for dollar bills. she told me i didn't get it. i told her that i didn't understand what was to get, i was her boyfriend and it was my job to look out for her. she told me ""you are literally and asshole and way overstepping your bounds!"" i told her that i didn't want to fight and she said it was too late. so instead of her going on a romantic date i had planned, she decided to hang out with her teammates. i am so upset because i was counting on seeing her tonight. 

based on what she said, am i the asshole for thinking her routine should be less sexy and telling her so?",3
"for telling my mom i think it's disgusting she is having another kid. i feel like i was in the right but my aunt, three of my siblings think i'm an asshole. i'm 31 and a female and i'm the oldest of ten kids my parents had me at 15,16 respectively. they both dropped out of high school and they got married when my mom was 17. my dad joined the military and they had my next sibling on my moms 18th birthday. my brother is 28, the other kids range in age from 10-27. i grew up taking care of my siblings, my mom and dad expected me to basically help raise their younger kids. because of this i have no interest in having kids myself. my 23 year old sister pretty much took over my role and still lives at home. 

my mom is 46 she homeschools the 10,12,14, and 17 year olds. she has never worked although she doesn't do chores or clean the kids chores cover that. her and my dad bought a fixer upper he planned on fixing up when he retires in a few years, they plan on turning into an organic farm.

however now that's all up in the air as my mom just announced this weekend she is pregnant again. she thought she was suffering from pre menopause..nope she's pregnant. thing is she also admitted she had not been taking her bc for the last year and had hoped to have one more child. 

i lost my cool because my dad has a bad back and he should have retired this year. now with the new baby he is saying he may have to work another ten years. i told my mom she's disgusting for doing that, and she had ten kids that's plenty enough 


she burst into tears and ran out of the room, my dad told me to leave unless i was going to apologize and my 20 year old brother and 23,25 year old sisters told me i was an asshole. 

my 28 year old brother and my gf said i maybe could have said it nicer but they think it's messed up. 

so reddit was i the asshole?",3
"for brushing out the curls on my biracial daughter?. edited to add- to the people out there with curly hair, i hear you and i understand! however, my daughter is 4. my husband and i both have worked hard to figure out how to care for her hair. he does play an active role in coming up with what she needs and i execute it. if i was willing to fight her tooth and nail every morning, i could style it into pretty curls, sure. but it is not worth it to me or my husband to do that to her because she hates it so much and we are not willing to override her bodily  autonomy just to make her hair look nice. it's just hair. what i'm doing is just getting the over-night matted rat's nest out. she does not have course hair. it is fine and smooth like mine and it because a matted mess just like mine, it can't be braided or put in a protective style, unfortunately. that will just rip her hair out. not that she would tolerate that, anyway. she removes anything or any style i've ever tried to do in her hair. even if she cooperates while i'm doing it, 5 minutes later, she'll just pull out whatever i put in. from french braids to hair clips and headbands. they're all a no-go.
my husband and i have put a lot of time and effort into finding out exactly how to best care for her hair, and this is really it for now. it's not the best for her hair but it is the best for her well being, as we've decided as her parents. we'll revisit her hair care when she's older, i promise. and i would never use heat treatments on a child. i don't care if it curls or not. we just want her to look half groomed.


--------------------------------
so i am white my husband is black and we have two daughters, ages 2 and 4. my 4 year old looks a lot like her (very handsome, if i might add) daddy. but she's got my texture hair with a massive amounts of curls that i usually am the one to take care of. yesterday i brushed her hair in to a ponytail and put her in an old, very dated (but cute for the time!) outfit from when i was a kid in the 90's and recreated a photo of me when i was her age. i thought it was adorable but i received a lot of backlash from my ""woke"" friends and family (on my side, for the record. i'm not close to his family and they all just ""heart"" any pictures of my kids and rarely comment, if they do just to say they like the picture) accusing me of trying to make her ""white"". 

i've had underhanded comments before from them about ""erasing my kid's identity"" for brushing her hair? she's a child. to maintain her curls to look good requires quite a bit of time and products. often she just lets me brush the rat's nest out of it and calls it a day. any time i style it, she sticks her hands in it and messes it up. what else can i do? however, doing this does brush the curls out until her hair gets wet again. she hates having her hair misted or dampeded and it's too cold for that now anyway. my husband doesn't care. he's happy she's clean and fed. 

to wrap this up, i've had more than one person say i need to leave my more ""black-passing"" child's image alone and let her embrace being black, especially because, get this, my 2 year old is more ""white-passing"" with wavy light hair and my blue eyes. including what i feel is dangerous advice to let her play outside without sunscreen. we have no idea what her sun tolerance is and i'm not about to deal with a small child having a sunburn i gave her on purpose. i have a low sun tolerance and don't tan, just burn like a boiled lobster. 

i'm going to be honest, this all blows my mind a little bit. my husband has never said anything of the sort. i've asked him about it and he said i don't need to worry about it. i don't let these people anywhere near my kids in person and some of them i can't avoid or just cut off. so am i being an asshole?",3
"for reporting a lyft driver because he tried to ask me out?. yesterday i treated myself to the movies & wine and decided taking a lyft would be the safest way home. 

the driver was chatty. i asked him about the house music he was playing because i liked it too, in hopes he would crank it up. instead, he began asking me what movie i saw, kept bringing up my 'boyfriend', asking me if i liked girls and so on.

i found this topic of discussion inappropriate & honestly i didn't even want to talk in the first place, but since i was in a locked car with a stranger, i responded casually that i'm not interested in anything & that i enjoy time by myself. 

that did not deter him from asking me out right as i was going to exit the car. i reminded him that i prefer to be alone and left.

part of me says reporting him would make the ride more comfortable for other girls & also appropriate for my level of discomfort but another says that this man made an error of judgment and i should just give him a lower rating instead.

edit:  thanks for all your thoughtful responses. i sent the report in and quickly received a message from lyft expressing concern and interest in resolving the issue. do i want him fired? no, hence this post. i just want him to be reminded on how to prioritize the experience the customer is paying for.

edit 2: this is my final say on the matter. this was not a flattering event for me. my ride was uncomfortable due to the driver's lack of awareness & decorum. i too, work at a job where ratings matter. i do my very best to make sure that my customers feel safe and comfortable. i was a captive audience the whole car ride, and that was taken advantage of. 

i did not expect this post to blow up, but since it did, please read these responses with empathy and learn something today. thank you.",3
"for letting a dementia patient add me to her will?. i was part of a meals on wheels program for community service in high school and met this wonderfully sweet old woman who didn't have any family nearby. 

we had a lot in common, i had been considering a career in social work, she didn't have any family nearby, and i didn't have any living grandmothers so we became fast friends. 

she developed dementia and towards the end i basically moved in with her and cared for her in exchange for free rent in her home and groceries. (it was also out of my love for her, but i couldn't have afforded to care for her full time if i also had to make rent.) 

she died and it was heartbreaking but i also saw firsthand how she was suffering in the final days, so it was bittersweet. 

she divided her will among her children and i equally. i did not ask her to do this, i never asked her about the contents of her will and the one time we briefly discussed it all we discussed was the house, not her savings. 

she left me 80k and change, and the same amount to her two children. a remarkable gesture and life changing for me, obviously. 

her children are contesting the will because she apparently added me in around the same time her dementia began to rear it's ugly head. they insist she was confused and had mistakenly come to believe i was one of her children and that even if she hadn't mistaken me to be one of her children, that she was not in her right mind when she did this so the will should be invalid. 

i am very conflicted as to my responsibility here.  i would obviously very much like to keep the money but i don't want to let how life changing the money would be cloud my judgment. i don't need it so badly that it would be worth doing wrong by her or her kids. 

am i the asshole?

"for refusing to talk to my mother unless she uses my title?. long story short, my mum was abusive growing up which led to me cutting contact the second i left home. the main form of abuse was saying i'd never amount to anything, was retarded, work at mcdonalds despite loads of evidence on the contrary. even after i received an offer from oxford med she kept telling me not to bother cause i'd drop out which was so wrong looking back on it.

&#x200b;

fast forward 7 years, i've recently become a qualified doctor and my mum wants to ""try having a better relationship with me"". we haven't met in person yet but have spoke over the phone where she seemed nicer than she used to be, but i insisted she called me ""dr \my name\"" or i wasn't speaking to her. at first she thought i was joking so i hung up and rejected her calls for a few weeks, and from then on she has used it.

my brother (mum was far nicer to him) has complained to me that i'm being a massive bell-end. to be honest i'm barely willing to speak to her, and not bothering at all unless she shows proper respect. aita?

&#x200b;

i'm sure it's going to get asked and no, i don't insist on being called dr outside of work, ever. at work i don't care either and although many people do call me dr, i don't expect it or get offended by its absence.

well this blew up. sorry won't be able to reply to everyone and thanks for the feedback.

"for not believing my girlfriend's 'discomfort' during sex?. pretty much says it in the title; whenever i initiate sex with my gf she winces in pain and says it's uncomfortable. yet whenever she is up for it there seems to be no pain issue at all. 

last night we were fooling around and i got her to orgasm through foreplay - zero issues or pain. i was pretty into it and initiated sex and instantly she was uncomfortable, despite me slowing down the pace. finally after one thrust she yelled out in pain pretty much directly in my face which was the final straw for me. this has been happening for so long now yet she never does anything about it and tbh i doubt there is any pain - and if there is then she seems to be exaggerating it way out of proportion. i know that people will say no vagina, no opinion; but i know for a fact that i wasn't being forceful or rough so to downright scream in my face was totally unnecessary. 

she has no other symptoms or discomfort aside from this, and like i said if she initiates then miraculously there's no problem. it's not a lube thing either, trust me i've tried that too. 

i guess the reason i'm asking is because last night we kinda had a big fight about it. i lost my cool and told her how huge a turn off it is to see her face screwed up in pain all the time, and how i didnt think the pain was as bad as she was making out. i told her that sex was becoming really boring and i could pretty much predict how it would go each time. i also said the only solution  at this point was just to not have sex. she called me an asshole and went on the offensive. said i have two moves and yet i expect her to be like a 'porn star'. 

so am i the asshole? or should there be more give and take in this scenario? can i insist she gets a medical check?

**tl;dr: girlfriend is in apparent pain any time i want to have sex, but is fine when she's the initiator. for calling her out on it?**",3
"for not being able to accept my partner's sexuality?. **update here(https://www.reddit.com/user/confusedbfthrowaway1/comments/bgi725/update_aita_for_not_being_able_to_accept_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) bc i'm apparently not allowed to post them here**

i know how the title of this sounds but please hear me out. also, this is a throwaway bc i'm pretty sure my partner knows my main account and i don't want her to see this. 

about a year ago my (20m) partner (25f) came out to me as polyamorous, and told me that she'd like to begin having sexual relationships with other men. she told me that, for her, it's not a case of wanting to date other people but more to make our relationship an open one where she's free to sleep with others if she wants too. i'm by no means an old fashioned dude - hell i even suggested we try out three ways for this, which she said wasn't the same - but i'm pretty into monogamy and told her that i wasn't necessarily comfortable with the idea of her sleeping with other guys. note: i'm not judging anyone who *is* into this type of relationship, just that it isn't at all for me.

long story short, she got absolutely hysterical about the fact that i told her i was uncomfortable with it, told me how depressed she was not being able to explore her sexuality to the fullest and pointing out how supportive she was of me when i came out as bisexual. i eventually caved and told her okay, but on the conditions that a) she doesn't bring anyone else into our bed and b) i don't have to hear about it in detail. she agreed and got on with finding other guys pretty quickly. she became noticeably happier after she started this, so i've just been kinda grinning and bearing it. 

thing is, she's seemingly become completely disinterested in having a physical relationship with me since she started them with other dudes. i'm not someone who's asking for sex every single night, but at this point i'm lucky if we do it once a month and she never wants to be casually affectionate with me any more. it's gotten to the point where our five year old daughter has noticed, and has asked me why mummy doesn't kiss me goodbye when she goes out any more. it feels like we're just mates who share a bed. conversely, she's going to meet other guys at least once a week and i'm fairly sure she's sleeping with them at least half the time. 

i brought my concerns up to her and she got upset again, saying i had no right to be mad bc she was sticking to my terms and that i was trying to police her sexuality. i'm now in a place where i'm completely torn. as i said, she's noticeably happier when she's exploring her sexuality to the fullest and of course i want her to be happy. and she really was very supportive of me when i came out as bi. but it's really killing me that she seems to not want anything to do with me intimately any more. i get that these guys are probably older and more experienced than i am, but it bums me out that i'm not enough for her. 

so what do y'all think? am i being an arsehole and should i just get over myself and try to learn to accept her more? or am i justified in being upset?

eta: made a comment saying this but people are still asking so i'll post an explanation about how i'm 20 with a 5 year old daughter. when i was a teen i was in a very violent and toxic environment at home. a dude in our building who i would petsit for took pity on me when things got real bad at home and would let me crash on his couch if i needed to get out of my parents' place for a night or two. my now gf was his flatmate and made it apparent she was interested in me, thinking i was ~17 (age of consent in the uk is 16). i didn't turn down her advances because i was a dumb 15 year old who thought banging a hot 20 year old chick would be peak cool. clearly in retrospect this wasn't a good idea, and no she didn't back off when she realised she was wrong about my age (obviously), but that's how that went down for everyone who's curious.",3
"for calling 911 on a friend for drunk driving?. i've officially been booted from my social circle and flamed by all my friends. we are all military families with young children and we have get togethers every weekend which includes booze.

one of my friends will drive home, with her 4 month old in tow, drunk. she insists her house is too close to uber and refuses rides from the rest of us. her husband is trashed too. 

granted, she only lives 15 minutes away, but that's 15 minutes after shots and beer pong, sometimes stumbling and throwing up. 

last friday, she was almost blackout drunk. she tried to bring my dog home instead of her own kid. her husband loaded their baby up and they were slurring as they drove away. i insisted they stay overnight but apparently their baby can't sleep anywhere but her own crib. i offered to drive and they kept saying no. my husband thinks it's not a big deal and all my friends kept telling me to chill, their house is so close by.

i picked up the phone and called 911 after sneaking into the bathroom. i gave them their license plate number and address. 

apparently they blew really high bac and child protective services are now involved. my friends are all livid with me and even my husband is pissed. no one wants anything to do with us and my husband keeps trying to explain to me that i violated friend code in the military community. i have been blocked by everyone on social media and we are furthermore uninvited to future get togethers. my husband is so mad!

i truly stand by what i did. am i really the asshole here?! everyone is so mad at me, am i just being a prude?! help please

**update:** thank you so much everyone for your votes of confident. i do feel a lot better, and thank you for the gold! i am getting a lot of nasty messages saying that i ruined a family and i should be ashamed, but i think they would be worse off if they died.

an update on my personal life- we're being interviewed by military police. the higher ranking people in my husband's chain of command are really thankful that the report was made. the lower ranking ones (my husband's peers) are pretty livid and any thanksgiving or christmas plans made with my family have been taken back. we're going to have to get used to outcast life for a while since we'll live here for at least another year. my husband has calmed down but he has barely spoken to me and has been sleeping on the couch.

i've deleted all my social media accounts for now just because i'm tired of being in the middle of this. i think i'm going to take a small vacation and stay with my parents in another state, until i can get my head on straight. 

**update 2:** to answer some of the questions people had about why i didn't try harder. 

i couldn't be around to collect their keys. i finished my shift and come home around 11pm (i work at a restaurant) and i just wanted to shower. everyone had already been partying for hours by now. the baby started to cry and the couple insisted they needed to go. i offered to get them an uber or they could have the pull out couch or even our bed. i tried to get an uber through the app but my husband told me i needed to stop nagging and leave them alone. it's not easy trying to convince a drunk person to stay if they insist on leaving.

no it didn't occur to me to slash their tires or break their car battery.

i don't know anything about calling their command. my husband is a first year in the military and graduated boot camp earlier this year.

i'm not trying to exaggerate how drunk they were, when i tried to get them to stay i could hardly make out what they were trying to say besides ""she needs her crib"" and ""our house is right there!"" 

to answer how they knew it was me, this isn't the first time i've tried to keep people from leaving a party before. there is a group text everyone is in and they asked me straight up if i made the call. i said i did. i didn't want to lie about it.",3
"for making a petty comment about a rude joke some baby boomer made to a waitress?. i was at a diner this morning, eating alone because i'm traveling for work. it was absolutely packed and there was a family at the table next to me. two college girls and their parents, it looked like.

the waitress came by their table and asked if they wanted coffee or water refills and the mom asked for more of both for everyone. kind of rudely, i thought. the dad made some joke about how it's amazing how coffee just shows up, it must be magic or elves. 

yeah it was about as awkward as it sounds. 

she came by my table and asked if i needed anything, and i asked for maple syrup, but ""no rush, because it's mad busy here and it's not like you've got magical elves or some shit helping you out""

"for not telling my husband that i know his secret. my husband and i have been married for almost two decades. we have a daughter who is my favorite person on this earth. she is so fantastic. she will be starting her senior year of high school and is preparing to apply for colleges.

i was contacted recently by another woman, who informed me that my husband had an affair with her, and when she found out about me, he arranged to pay child support for their child under the table so that i wouldn't find out. she sent me a number of documents recording bank transfers, which i was able to match to transfers from our accounts, as well as photos of my husband with their child through the years. she also provided the dates of his visits to her, which line up with several of his business trips. 

i was totally devastated and took the time to think it over and verify everything before i confronted my husband. i have decided that i am going to wait a year until i tell him that i know and file for divorce. it will be a terrible year for me but i know i can fake it since he's traveling for work a lot anyway. i have decided to do this for several reasons:

1. our daughter will be applying to college soon and will be starting a really important year. i don't want to blow her life up with a divorce and the bombshell that her father was unfaithful and now she has a sibling that neither of us knew about. 
2. my husband has many more financial resources than i do. i am well aware that if i file for divorce while our daughter still lives at home, he will leave me to care for her and will make me fight tooth and nail for monetary support and will likely drain me with legal fees, as he tends to be litigious. i make enough to support myself comfortably, but not enough to comfortably support myself and my daughter.
3. i fear that opening this door will open others. that is, i worry that he may have other children that i don't know about, which would only magnify the hurt for both me and my daughter, and i don't think that now is the time to handle it.

my question is, does my plan make me an asshole? i feel slimy not telling him right now and faking my affection for him, but i fear for my daughter's wellbeing and my own ability to support us. aita?

"if i don't go to this job interview my cousin referenced me for. so like 3 months ago when i was looking for a job my cousin suggested i work at the restaurant she works at. at the time i was like yeah that sounds cool, but had also just started working for doordash just to have income. however i actually enjoy doordash and delivering, plus i like the flexibility. so the place my cousin works at never called or replied to my resumes. 

however i just ran into her yesterday, 3 months later and after talking to her for a few minutes   (we ran into each other when she was walking into work) she said she'd tell them about me again. so she calls me yesterday and said they want me to interview today. i really had put no thought into taking the job or a new one at that cus i'm content with what i'm doing now. however i spontaneously said yes. but now the interview is in an hour and i honestly don't want to go. but my cousin gave me a reference and said she's excited to work with me but i just don't know how to feel or what to do. truth is i really am not looking for another job and one has just been sprung upon me. i know i accepted the interview but, idk....

edit: i'm on my way to the interview now. i know for my cousins reputation the least i can do is show up. i'm just going to wing it and give it some more thought so if they call back and offer the job i'll have a more thought out answer

edit 2: the manager is 20 minutes late to the interview now

edit 3: actually glad i went because the reason i was hesitant was because i thought they'd be hiring me as a host. however they said they're looking for delivery and were interested in my doordash experience and said they'd cover mileage, include tips, and guarantee pay if there are no deliveries. that's more than i have with doordash so i actually am interested in this position now. they set me up for another interview. thank you to everyone here who called me an asshole and made me feel bad so i'd get my ass to the interview. actually worked out in my favor.

last edit: it was definitely an interesting day. initially when i posted this, within the first 3 minutes about 5 people said i was the asshole. that made me feel pretty bad so i went to go to the interview 10 minutes after posting. edit 1 occurred 10 minutes after the post, edit 2 about 20-30 minutes after edit1, then edit3 about 45 minutes after. glad you all enjoyed the read.",3
"for telling my mom that i caught my aunt and my adult brother having sex (and getting her kicked out)?. i'll just get right into it. my aunt had been staying with us for 4 months. we never saw her  often because she lives on the other side of the country but my mom took her in after a horrible divorce. i immediately noticed that she was acting a little weird/loony but i attributed that to having gone through so much with her husband. my brother (who's 20) seemed to make a lot of effort to spend time with her but i didn't think anything of it because why would i? 

i came back early from work one day and heard really loud noises. the more i listened, the more i realized someone was definitely having sex. i instantly thought that my brother brought a girl home or something because the noises came from his room. his door was somewhat open so i rushed past it to get to mine only to be stopped dead in my tracks when i saw the back of my aunt, clear as day. i instantly felt like throwing up and managed to get to my room without them seeing me. in there i pretty much collapsed, contemplated my existence and the utter fucked-up-ness of my family (i knew it was fucked up, but not like this) then i just felt scared. i didn't know what it meant. i knew it was wrong, very wrong, but not what to do about it. i was also honestly super scared for their well being, especially my brother who had already been abused by my cousin as a kid (my aunt and mother were also abused by my uncles. this what i meant by fucked up family). i just kind of panicked. 

so the next day, my aunt went to work and i knew she would be there late. when my mom came home, i instantly told her i needed to tell her something. i sat her down and told her exactly what i saw and heard and she went ballistic. she stormed to her car and drove to my aunts job. my aunt never came back. 

my brother is now very upset with me. he told me that they're two consenting adults and can do whatever they want and that they weren't hurting anybody and that it was never my business. he has all of his stuff packed and he's planning on driving across the country to be with her tonight. my mom is still livid about it and told every single one of my family members. they all hate my aunt now and want nothing to do with her. this made me feel guilty because they used to absolutely adore her. 

now i'm stuck wondering if i made an asshole move by ""telling"" on them. my family is a mess, my mom who already had issues has seemingly gone off the rails, my aunt is all on her own and my brother might never forgive me.

edit/update: my brother left late last night/early this morning to be with my aunt. i tried to stop him but he was adamant that none of this was her fault and that he was the one who started it and couldn't let her deal with this on her own. he also said he's been in love with her since he was a kid. before he left, he told me that he isn't angry with me and apologized for being upset before. i told my mom he left and she had no reaction.",3
"for letting a girl believe regular brownies were ""weed brownies"" and letting her make a fool of herself all night in front of our friends?. so there's this girl in my friend group. she has a tendency to be kind of over the top and stretches the truth a lot. we all were hanging out over the weekend to celebrate another friend's birthday. apparently a few people had the idea to give her ""pot brownies"" and see how she'd react. the catch is that they had nothing in them at all. but they were banking on her acting high anyway to fit in with everyone else. 

i didn't find out about this whole plan until i got there. everyone else pretended to be high and so did the girl, predictably. i didn't participate in that part but i also didn't tell her it was all a huge joke at her expense. 

at the end of the night someone told her and called her out on always being fake. she got really upset and ended up leaving the party early by herself. i do feel bad for her but i also feel like she kind of brings this on herself sometimes because she's always trying too hard. 

again though, this wasn't my prank and i probably wouldn't have planned something like this myself. but it is what it is now. 

aita?

**edit: okay not sure why this post blew up like this. wow. anyway i get that people feel like we were all wrong in the situation. i said from the start i didn't like how it went. but despite what people think, we are actually all still friends (including the girl who got pranked). i would bring the situation up but it's now been like 3 days and i feel like it'll just cause drama. if it does ever come up i will say i think it was wrong, apologize etc. gotta say though, i find it a little ironic that people are literally telling me to kill myself in pm while also lecturing me about being a bully.**",3
"for asking my friends if their daughter has blue eyes?. one of my cousins, peter just had a baby with his girlfriend a few days ago. peter and all his siblings all have very stunning blue eyes which they inherited from their mom. they always get compliments on their eyes. peter and his girlfriend posted a picture on social media of their baby girl today saying she was born on the 23rd and i decided to give peter a call to congratulate him. when i called he was with his girlfriend and the phone was on speaker. i congratulated both of them and said their baby was gorgeous and that they'll be great parents. i then asked peter ""did she get your blue eyes?"" (in the picture they posted on social media the eye color wasn't visible) peter and his girlfriend's tone completely changed and his girlfriend said ""jesus, why are you so concerned by the eye color of my baby. it's fucking weird"" i was pretty taken aback by her reaction. i didn't mean anything by it i was just curious. i thought this was a normal conversation point. i tried to say i didn't mean to offend her and apologize but she kinda cut me off and said they were really busy and they had to go.

i told my mom what happened and she said that peter's girlfriend is a new mom and is probably just emotional and thought i was insulting her baby but that i didn't say anything wrong. however my sister said i was out of line and that the fascination people have with blue eyes is weird and there were racial implications since peter's girlfriend is biracial (half jamaican). this didn't make sense to me. i never said not having blue eyes was bad. my eyes are brown! i was just curious!

here?

edit: yeah ok peter called our family to thank my mom for a gift and we talked a bit. i apologized again for offending them. he accepted my apology but said his girlfriend is was really mad at me but she'll probably calm down in a day or 2. he explained that they've been harassed by family members from even before the baby was born about whether the baby would have blue eyes and his girlfriend is very annoyed by people's fixation on eye color and feels there's some racist undertone to it since blue eyes are ""white features"" and that people think her baby would be any less beautiful if it didn't have blue eyes. apparently his mom said during her pregnancy ""too bad she probably won't have blue eyes"" and his girlfriend started crying and refused to talk to her for weeks. i feel really bad now.
and he said the baby's eyes are grey.",3
"for not caring about my wife's injury.. so my wife (26f) and her friends decided to do a 4 day vegas holiday, she saved up heaps of money to blow on the poker machines and picked out some super sexy outfits.

they wanted to drive to this new bar that had opened. 

my wife's court date is soon 

she managed to break her leg and has been relying on crutches to get around.

"for vetoing my husband's name choice for our child?. my husband and i were having trouble agreeing on a name for our daughter, so we decided we'd each pick one and then decide which arrangement sounded better to determine which name would be a first name and which would be the middle. it wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. i genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that i would hate that much.

he picked the name aryann (pronounced ah-ree-ann). i don't know where he got that, but i'm jewish and having a kid with a name so close to ""aryan"" is not okay with me. i suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. he thinks i'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name ""aryann."" am i the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?

"for wanting another child?. throwaway because i'm sure some people will find this controversial and i don't want it tied to my main.

when my wife and i got married we agreed that we would have 2 kids unless both were girls, then we'd have a 3rd to try for a boy. i'm a guy's guy and i grew up with only brothers so i feel strongly that i want a son to bond with. that's not to say that i don't love my daughter equally. i just want to raise someone to follow in my footsteps with sports and girls and stuff. after some convincing, my wife agreed to this but said that if the 3rd kid was a girl, we'd stop trying. anyway, we ended up having one boy (8 years old) and one girl (5 years old). this background is important because you need to know that having a 3rd kid was something that was on the table.

last month, our son told us that he likes boys. this is totally fine, i'm not a homophobe, but i'm starting to feel like i want to have a 3rd kid so we can try to have a straight boy. i love my son more than anything and i wouldn't love a straight kid more than him, but at the end of the day i wanted to be able to bond with one of my kids over traditional masculine stuff, which includes women. 

my wife doesn't think that this is a good reason to have a 3rd kid. she said that she would be open to having a 3rd kid but that she finds my reasoning disgusting and she doesn't think she can go through with it knowing the reason for me wanting one. i don't think she understands how special it is for a father to have a son who can follow in his footsteps. am i the asshole or is she overreacting?",3
"for calling my brothers girlfriend ""miss piggy"" for eating our food after we told her not too?. so last year my brother moved in with me and my roommate. when he moved in his girlfriend started spending a lot of time at our place. this isn't a problem as my roommates girl friend comes over too. here's the thing though. my brothers gf pretty much eats all our food. no matter who's it it she will eat it. me and roommate have told her multiple times to stop eating the food we buy and only eat the food brother buys but she ignores us and eats our food anyway.

&#x200b;

we have confronted her and my brother multiple times and told them she needs to stop but she just says ""tee hee, sorry but it's so good"" and he refuses to say anything about it. we both have tried to talk him into going to her house insted of bringing her over but he doesn't want too. it's gotten to the point where both of us are considering getting a second fridge to put a lock on. 

&#x200b;

well, we're both sick of it. brothers gf is a heavy girl and weight is a very touchy issue with her. well, recently both of us have taken to calling her miss piggy when she eats our food. if we ever see her eating our food or after she has we confront her and call her it. she hates it and has freaks out each time she hears us refer to her as it. honestly though, she still eats our food and so we kept doing it. 

&#x200b;

well, today when i got home from work his gf was there eating leftovers i had cooked last night. i told her ""wow, i love to come home to see miss piggy eating my leftovers that i was looking forward too."" before i started oinking at her. she broke down crying and ran out.  she's been calling my brother furiously since and is refusing to come here anymore because i'm an ""asshole"".

"for refusing to eat meals with my friend because he's an obnoxious vegan?. for refusing to eat with my friend because he's vegan? 

let me explain.

i met my friend alex in my second year of university when we were both cast in a play together. we hit it off with similar interests and decided to live together last year. 

a bit of background: alex is a vegan - and i mean that as literally as i can. he is a philosophy student and loves debating. i think he also has a bit of a superiority complex. alex talks constantly about the immorality of eating meat. he brings it up daily. he has posters of animated cows looking sadly at steaks hung in his bedroom. he has said, and i am directly quoting, that ""eating meat is the same thing as defending slavery because you don't think the lives of black people have meaning."" he has said ""eating meat is the equivalent of joining and supporting isis."" 

he is not joking. 

he calls anyone who eats meat ""carnist pigs"". he says this to their face while they eat. he believes it is his life's mission to educate people out of eating meat and awaken them to veganism. if we are in line together in a restaurant and someone else is ordering, he'll judge and mock them (out loud) for ordering anything meat or dairy related. he'll constantly say ""hey, check this out!"" and show you whatever vegan food he is eating, going into detail about the ingredients and where they come from. by constantly, i mean nearly every time he eats a meal, he does this. he'll come into your room to show you his plate. 

now, i don't disagree with him morally. we've had dozens of debates on the subject philosophically and i concede on many of his points. there's no doubt that eating meat is a morally fraut issue. where i take issue is that he deliberately tries to make people feel guilty for their dietary choices. i have started eating out, or at other people's houses. i've been packing my lunches in secret because i just don't want to deal with him. 

if anyone tells alex to piss off, he responds with ""cool, have fun murdering!"" or ""enjoy your death sandwich!"" 

so flash forward to today. we're in line at a burrito restaurant. i'm ordering my usual thing, and he makes a comment about how i could fill my tortilla with veggies rather than support systemic murder. similar to the crap he always says. 

i look him dead in the eye and tell him, ""man, if you don't stop doing this shit when we eat, i'm not going to eat with you anymore. the way you behave is inappropriate and hostile and frankly, i'm not interested in being friends with someone who makes it their mission to humiliate people like this."" 

he laughed and told me to chill. i said i was dead serious. he hasn't spoken to me since. not sure the best thing to do here since our lease doesn't expire until may. i'd love to be able to eat a pepperoni pizza in my home without being called a terrorist.

so, aita? how should i go about navigating this? 

edit #1: obligatory wow, this blew up comment! thank you for chiming in. for those of you saying this is pretty one-aided - like, yeah. i was mainly seeking advice on how to handle it going forward, and writing it down helps you clarify how crazy shit is when it happens. and i got a lot of helpful tips so thanks! 

for those asking why we are friends: he can be a great guy. we get along and agree on about 95% of other subjects. we have a history together now. i was used to him making jabs, but didn't know he was this insufferable until we lived together. 

for those saying this is fake - man, i wish. i constantly tell him not to behave like a meme of himself. so i get why it might read that way, but he's legit.",3
"aita? my boss asked me to give advice to new hires on how to excel at work, i said our job is 30% work and 70% luck.. at a unit meeting the other day, my boss introduced two new hires, recent graduates who are training to become account managers. my boss told them that i am one of the top account managers in our unit and asked me what advice i can give the new hires on how to succeed at this job.

i said that our job is 30% work and 70% luck, sometimes you get big deals with minimal effort and sometimes you give it everything you have but the deal still doesn't push through. but what's important is to have good relationships with your co-workers because work is much easier when you have a positive work environment.

after the meeting my boss talked to me and he was not happy about the advice i gave. he said that he wanted the new hires to see me as a role model but instead i embarrassed him by encouraging them to be complacent since i said that 70% of the job is luck. he said that i know the advice i should give them is to set goals and work hard to achieve them as their careers are just beginning but i went with trying to sound cool instead of giving them the best advice.

i specifically avoided telling the new hires that they should work hard because i don't work hard myself and everyone else in the room knows that. i'm not humble bragging. i was always an average employee, i just got lucky these past three years because even without asking my clients brought me their friends who also ended up doing business with me so the deals basically just fell into my lap. but even now i have a lot of lazy days where i procrastinate or i go on sudden leaves just because i don't feel like working.

i didn't want to be that person who doesn't practice what she preaches, but should i have told them what they needed to hear instead of what i really wanted to say?

edit: wow this blew up.

thank you to everyone who is worried that i might get fired or i won't be promoted because of what i said, thankfully promotions in our company depend on your performance. we have guaranteed merit increases as long as we meet their our budgets, and if you go over your budget you get a bigger increase. unless i do something against company policies or i don't meet my budget for three straight years my boss also can't recommend my termination. even then it's not my immediate boss who decides if i get fired, so i think i'm pretty safe.

i still believe that a big part of my achievements in the past three years is down to luck. i didn't do anything different than what i did the past five years. i was nice and accommodating to my clients before but they didn't refer any deals or the ones they did did not push through. i don't know what changed these last three years. but the reality is that the clients came to me and from there i just had to type some templated proposals.

in contrast i have coworkers who bust their ass marketing new clients on their own, they have good relationships with their existing clients but do not get referrals, or they make somersaults to sort out terms and conditions to make a deal happen but the client suddenly says he doesn't need the deal anymore. that's why i think that i've been lucky and i know this luck is not gonna last forever.

but i see your point that maybe i shouldn't have said what i did at a formal meeting like that in front of my boss.",3
"for admitting to my boyfriend that i think he's bad in bed?.  i did not bring this up but when ""what makes someone good in bed"" came up in conversation, my boyfriend asked me point-blank if i think he's good in bed, and i said no. he's angry because it's not his fault i don't get off, which is true. i can't get off just from piv sex, and he doesn't like the things that do get me off (oral, kissing, foreplay). 

i've told him twice now, politely, that i'm unsatisfied and i'd like him to do x, y, and z to fix that (initiate, show some passion/lust, occasionally offer to do the things that might help me get off, like play with me with a toy). he agrees he knows how to please me, he just doesn't make the effort because he doesn't get anything out of it. so i said ""well yeah that's literally the definition of 'bad in bed'"". he got angry and said it's my job to ""make"" him do those things. i said ""well i can't enjoy it if i have to force you, that's not sexy at all"" and he got huffy and left. 

obviously i'm very grateful that he's wants to sleep with me at all (i dated my last boyfriend for five years and he really only wanted it once every month or two), but i don't think that that alone makes someone ""good in bed"". i put a ton of effort into my appearance/fitness, i show initiative and enjoyment in our sex life, i compliment him and make him feel sexy…he does none of those things. otherwise our relationship is good though, so of course i'd never tank it over this. was i supposed to just lie to my boyfriend? am i the asshole here?",3
"for sleeping on the floor?. i'm a very tall woman.

i'm about 6'5. it's difficult but i manage. i'm out of town right now visiting my brother, his wife and their kids. my sil is a kind of neurotic, tense person, a perfectionist, and she and i have never gotten along, but we're polite and civil for my big brother's sake. plus, i love my nieces, so being nice to her is just carte blanche.

they have a small house so while i'm here they've had the younger daughter share a bed with the older one, giving me the five year old's bed. i knew right away that the little bed was gonna be waaaaaay too short but after my seven hour drive i just wanted some sleep. my feet stuck off the end a good foot and a half.

the next night i just took the pillow and blanket and slept on the floor next to the bed. there was a rug so it wasn't too bad but definitely not the best. the next day i waited until everyone was asleep and went out to the sofa. i was still too tall but it was better than the floor. next day sil asked me not to sleep on the sofa via text message after she went to work. that night i slept on the floor again and the next morning sil came in to see if i wanted breakfast and found me sleeping there.

it became this huge thing and culminated with me leaving to stay in the only hotel in the small town they live in, which is a thirty minute drive from their ranch. now my brother and sil are pissed at me, the nieces are sad that i'm not sleeping over. for sleeping on the floor or should i have just sucked it up?",3
"for adopting a dog with the same name as my daughter?. my wife and i have two kids, kristopher (9) and sadie (12). for kris' birthday last friday, my wife and i decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.

my wife and i decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because i've heard they have better temperaments. other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the humane society and when i got there, i immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb pit mix with beautiful green eyes. when i saw her name was sadie like our daughter, i thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. my wife thought the coincidence was funny when i told her, too, which is important.

so i arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last friday after a birthday dinner for kris. i pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) sadie. both kids were thrilled but kris was the happiest i'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until i told them her name. my daughter sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and immediately insisted that kris change sadie's name. she kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so i told her we'd talk about it later.

well, this week has been hellish. kris is insistent we keep sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. he says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and i think he has a point. i also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. my daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. my wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. i put my foot down because this is kris' birthday present and his choice.

"for having an ""unhealthy relationship"" with my daughter?. this is something i did not put much thought into but since my ex expressed her outrage, perhaps the internet can judge this. 


without too much context, my ex left me and our daughter jo(not real name) many years ago and i have been raising her all by myself these years. she is 27 now, still living with me and works in a cafe nearby. 


jo, while having the intelligence of a normal person(aced in chemistry back in school), has the emotional maturity of a child. it does not take much for her to get upset or become happy, she loves praises and hugs, dislike strangers but warms up to them easily. she gets awkward talking to adults and loves playing with children, but would also pick fights and throw tantrums despite being 3 times their age. i can give more examples but i hope you get the idea. 


me and jo split the house chores and takes turns to cook for each other. we would also do ""goodbye hug"" and ""goodnight kiss"" on the cheek every day when we leave for work or go to sleep, separate rooms, to be clear. i would praise jo if she has done her part of the chores properly as she likes praises, and also buy her snacks from time to time. 


i have not find another partner after my ex because jo would certainly be upset, and i have gotten used to staying this way. jo has been single too(as far as i know) and has shown no intention of moving out, which i am fine with it. there has only ever been 2 of us in the house after ex moved. 


my ex, whose private life is not mine to share, paid us a visit some time ago, a long time in many years for an update on jo. she was absolutely disgusted of our lifestyle. she said we were living like a couple which is not supposed to be, we are father and daughter for christ sake! she demanded that we seek therapy and have jo moved out so that she can be independent and have her own life. jo in turn, screamed at her birth mother and kicked her out of the house.  


i have nothing on my conscience as we never ever did anything questionable or vile. therapy? we are both happy adults enjoying our lives. have jo move out? if she wants i won't stop her, but if she's happy here then she can stay as long as she likes. 


i do think i am not the ah who ""ruined"" my daughter's life with this ""unhealthy relationship"", but i shall leave you to judge. aita?


info: it is not medically proven but i believe jo is not in the spectrum or has disabilities as many of you think. she is smart and functional and capable of living by herself(proven when i went business trips and left her home alone when she was in her teens, the house was kept clean and tidy), but she is also lazy and enjoys being spoilt. she has 2 close friends her own age, also single, and would hang out with them sometimes. i also believe that therapy is only required if it cause problems, and if she is happy with her life, even if it is a little out of the norm, i don't think we need any therapy.",3
"for feeling jealous that my sister is getting more attention for her illness than i am for mine?. about 5-6 months ago, i (18f) started having problems with my ears turning red and getting a lil warm. i scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist bc initially i thought it was allergies. turns out it had to do with the cartilage in my ears rather than the skin. i was referred to a rheumatologist, for whom i had to go make another appointment for, but i couldn't get in to see her for 3 weeks.

while i waited, my ears got worse. to the point where i can no longer leave my room anymore. i have to sit in my room all day, in the dark, in front of a fan, with ice packs strapped to my head because it's that bad. the burning is excruciating and constant. i can numb it with ice packs, but only until they melt.

also during this time, my sister (23f) began to experience lots of issues with cramps and pain in her abdomen. it turns out she has an ovarian cyst which is causing her pain whenever she has her period. i by no means discount that fact that she is in a lot of pain. she is very very vocal about how much it hurts. here's where i'm frustrated, however.

once i finally get to the rheumatologist, she basically sits down and tells me that i have relapsing polychondritis. which is a rare genetic autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the cartilage in the body. since it's so rare, they don't know what triggers it, and treatment is mostly trial and error. they worry about long term because cartilage is everywhere in your body, including the heart and windpipe. if my body started to attack either of those, it could spell disaster. basically, it could flare up in the wrong place at the wrong time and i could die at a young age because of it. the possibility of a flare up in my heart is a major concern, and i just learned all of this on wednesday.

meanwhile my sister is having issues with her cyst again, and is wailing and crying. for sure she is hurting, but also i just learned that i could die at any point. my parents have elected to skirt around that fact, and haven't offered me a bit of comfort about it, instead focusing on my sister. i am forced (through pure necessity) to sit alone in my room all day long, every day, and have been for the last few weeks. i am extremely lonely. my parents make minimal effort to check on me. at most it's a brief four sentence conversation and then they go right back upstairs to take care of my sister. nobody comes to talk to me, nobody comes to see me, nobody sits with me.

tonight i made it it upstairs to get some food, and i saw my mom in my sister's room, lying on the bed with her, rubbing her back and comforting her. and seeing how much my mom was caring for my sister while also forgetting me made me feel jealous. i don't doubt for a second that my sister is in a lot of pain. i'm just jealous that i've been forgotten about while i've learned that i could die young & that i have an autoimmune disorder that i'll carry with me for the rest of my life. for feeling jealous?",3
"for smacking the shit out of my 8-year-old nephew for stealing hundreds of dollars of my pokemon cards and taking some of them to school and trading with them?. little bit of backstory: i really enjoy pokemon and play competitively in tournaments and open a shit ton of packs. doing this means i have a very large collection of valuable cards. i still love at my parents house (i'm 18), and i keep them all on a shelf in my room. my nephew is 8, almost 9 and he and my niece is living with us because my sister abandoned them for some druggie on the streets. 

anyway, a few days ago i got home from work and was wanting to edit one of the decks i had built for the tournament later in the day. i go to pick up a few deck boxes and a binder and found that one of my binders, and 3 of 9 deck boxes were missing. i immediately freak out because i have them all very organized and well-kept. my nephew has **a lot** of behavioral issues and gets in a lot of trouble both at home and school. he also isn't ever really disciplined because it would make the situation worse(you'd understand if you met him and my family). so i go into his room to look for them. lo and behold, there they are, scattered all over the floor, most of them taken out of sleeves, some bent, some of them was thrown in his backpack—oh and my binder was completely empty. at this point i was *beyond* furious and all i could mutter was "" oh my god"" over and over. 

after i pick everything up that i could find, i go upstairs and casually bring him back down to his room and then start screaming at him, and demanding him to find the rest of them. he kept saying he didn't do it and he didn't steal them, that they were in his room when he woke up and he thought they were his (keep in mind he lies about *everything*). so i get even madder if that's possible and i smack the shit out of his leg. then he starts screaming bloody murder and my nstep dad comes down and demands to know what's going on. i couldn't even get a word out before the child went up to him and said i was trying to kill him. my nstep dad coddles him and then gets in my face and threatens to beat me to death if i ever lay another finger on him. 

after they question him for about an hour, he finally admits that he took them to school and was trading and giving them away with his classmates. his punishment: a stern warning and no tv for the night (which he screamed and cried over). he also said he hates me and wished i would just move out and die. my parents then berated me for a while and essentially told me that i'm a child abuser and if i did that again they would have to call the police and have me charged with assault (mostly my nstep dad saying this, my mom understood what i did and didn't make it a big deal). all in all i recovered most of the cards losing about 20 out of 250, but with all of the damage that was done to some of the cards i probably lost about $180 of cards. 

so am i the asshole in this situation? was i overreacting by disciplining him because my parents don't? i get that it's not my place to do that, but i completely think that it was deserved and i honestly feel that i should've smacked him again. he goes back to school today and i have already contacted his teacher and explained the situation; thankfully, she's going to confiscate every pokemon card she finds and let me come in after hours to find which ones are mine. sorry for the lengthy post but i needed to vent my frustrations. aita? 

tldr: nephew went in my room and stole approximately 250 valuable cards while i was working; i get home and find out and i smack the shit out of him. then i'm threatened to be killed/ be turned into the police for assault the next time i put my hands on him. 

edit: holy shit my inbox 
and to clear up a few things:

nstepdad means narcissistic stepdad which is a term from /r/raisedbynarcissists 

i made this post looking for objective opinions, i personally think he deserved it but what i did was wrong and therefore i'm an asshole. 

we made it to front page :o now everyone will know i'm an asshole d:

"for using my boyfriend's phobia to prove a point?. this happened a little over a week ago and i still feel bad about it. so, my boyfriend has a bit of a hobby collecting knives. switchblades, butterfly knives, he's pretty proud of all of them. now, i have a small phobia of my own. my father was very abusive, and of the few memories i have of him, he was often threatening an infant me with a switchblade. as such, i'm very uncomfortable around them. my boyfriend will often point his in my direction, and when i get upset and tell him to stop he says i need to get over it. that i might need to use one some day. that i should know he'd never hurt me. i guess he feels like if he exposes me to it enough, i'll learn to trust that he won't stab me with it? but it's not like i think that to begin with, i'm just uncomfortable around them.

well, he has a very intense phobia of a specific monster. i don't question it. for some reason, it's much more intense than my mild annoyance/breath stopping moment at the blades. he completely freaks out at even just a picture, shuts down, has nightmares for nights. if there's a chance of one showing up in a video he will whimper and whine and either stop it all together or close his eyes and ask me to tell him when it is over. i promised him early on that i didn't find it funny like some of his friends do and wouldn't use it to prank him.

well, the other night after cutting some cheese with his stupid knife, he tried waving it at me, knowing how uncomfortable it makes me. so i pulled up a particularly horrifying image of his phobia on my phone and shoved it in his face. ""how does it feel? you know what a phobia is like, right? just get over it!"" i tried to paraphrase him, and he got really upset. i feel like i may have gone overboard and honestly feel guilty, but he hasn't messed with me since.",3
"for telling my wife and family i have accepted my fate and will not have any more chemo and that i want to travel instead?. im a 36 year old man with acute myeloid leukemia. the initial chemo put it into remission, but its now come back and its not stopping. 

i have been on my second run of chemo for two years, and there has been little to no improvement. just delaying the inevitable. most people with leukemia die after 5 years. mine is even worse.

i feel sick everyday. i used to lift regularly and now all my muscles are basically gone with excess grandma skin on my arms and legs.

i lost so much hair at the top of my head i just started shaving it off.

i cant have sex with my wife anymore, when i try i cant maintain erections. i have pissed myself multiple times over the years in my sleep. i cant eat steaks anymore because of my stomach.

i cant play with my daughters and everytime i go to one of their soccer matches i get weird looks and take all the attention off of them.

i just dont have any fight left anymore. i repeat to myself everyday, ""its over, and thats ok"".

the truth is i haven't accomplished much in my life. i wanted to be a writer when i was younger but i ended up as an office manager at a car dealership. i always said i would do it later but then the years sort of piled on. i had one life and i wasted it, but so do most people i guess.

i am proud of my wife and daughters. they make me very happy. they haven't accepted that its over yet but i have. my wife means well but she wants me to stay in treatment long enough to put it back into remission again. i dont see it. i just think we need to come to terms with this.

i do not just want to lay in bed all day. i want to travel for these years i have left. see the country. maybe go to italy or japan or the uk. i want to experience this planet in ways i never thought about before.

i told my wife this and she says im being selfish and im giving up. i dont see it that way, i feel more alive now than ive felt in a long time. i feel like i have no fear of trying scary things or writing a book or travelling to a jungle.

ive spent so many years wasted. she says she wont stick by me if i do this. aita?",3
"for being livid at my roommate for calling me an ambulance?. so thursday, i went to a party one of my friends threw. it was your pretty standard college party and i got pretty drunk yada yada. when i went back to my house, i was stumbling around trying to get to my room. one of my housemates helped me to my room and told me to sleep it off which i planned to do. 


i don't remember too much since i blacked out but this is what some of my housemates told me. my roommate was in the room when i came in and he said i kept falling off the bed and talking to myself. he ended up calling an ambulance for me and apparently the emts forced me to go to the hospital and threatened to call the police if i didn't go so i didn't have a choice. 

when i woke up in the hospital the next morning, the nurse gave me papers to sign and then let me leave. they also stuck me with a $1000 hospital bill for the ambulance. since i was basically dragged to the hospital, i left my keys and phone inside so i couldn't get in. none of my housemates were home so i ended up just waiting outside of the house for like an hour before one of them finally came back. on top of that, i missed my cad class which is a whole different story. 

i was absolutely pissed with my roommate for calling me an ambulance. not only did i end up spending the night at some hospital, i got a $1000 bill on top of it too. it's one thing if i had alcohol poisoning or something like that but i literally just slept at the hospital and left the next morning. the housemate who helped me inside was on my side, he said i was hammered but it wasn't that bad and i could just sleep it off. the roommate said he got scared and didn't know they would take me to the hospital but that just made me even more mad since there was like 5 other people in the house at the time and his first reaction was to call the police rather than ask the others. so aita?

edit: i'm not mad at my roommate for calling the ambulance. if i looked that ducked up, i would probably do the same. i'm upset about the fact that calling the cops was his first instinct rather than ask the other roommates. i mentioned my other housemate said i was super drunk but i could sleep it off and my roommate instantly decided to call the cops. i didn't get any tests at the hospital, i literally just slept there for the night and left when i woke up. some of the comments are correct in that the american healthcare system is unfortunately part of the issue here. i was willing to endanger myself rather than pay a $1000 bill i can't afford. if that makes me ta, then so be it.",3
"if i set my mother in law up to drop in on my roommate jerking off?. so, the title is probably almost as weird as the actual explanation. bear with me.

i've got the typical awful, overbearing mil situation. the woman doesn't like me, hasnt for roughly 6 years now. her son and i have been together almost 7 years. we have two kids. she's done everything from boundary stomping, criticizing our parenting choices, threatening to have our child taken from us and placed in her custody if we moved out of state, and threatening to call cps if we didnt bow to her wishes. suffice to say this woman is insane, and we did end up moving 2000 miles away with zero chance of losing custody, obviously.

so, we are no contact with her off and on. currently we hear from her once every 3 months or so and see her once a year. the most recent time she was in town, she gave my boyfriend an amazon alexa for the kids. it's one of the fancy ones with the screen and camera for video chatting. now, maybe i'm just being petty because her and i obviously dont get on, but i'm not interested in seeing or hearing from her any more than we do already.

my boyfriends younger brother and his girlfriend, when they found out that she had gotten this for us, warned me to disable the drop in permissions because this woman was just randomly dropping into the device and accessing the camera into their apartment. so i was instantly suspicious of this fucking thing. i disabled the permissions, and the kids aren't allowed to use it unless someone is in the room anyway.

i was talking about how shady it was with our roommate, and he said that he had a much better idea than disabling it.

put it in his room, and any time he feels like it, he'll just jerk it while making direct eye contact with the camera.

i feel like disabling it is enough, but i would be lying if i said this wasn't a hilariously tantalizing prospect. is it over the top to do this if i'm pretty confident that she would just drop in and see this happening?

thanks in advance!

edit: alright y'all, this has been wild. thank you for all your replies. whether you're in the asshole camp or not, it's been fun to read your comments! i'm not going to do it, as the general takeaway here is that it will cause a headache i dont need. but some commenters have given me some g rated alternatives that i'm definitely going to try. thank you guys so much!",3
"for not consulting my roommate about some of the things i do to the dorm. hello! i posted here before about this girl before because she used to constantly have the heat on in summer. we got that worked out but now everything else is a problem.

i just started college as a freshman at an art school and they gave us the option to join dorms that had our interests and find people to live with who are like us. our dorm is like an apartment, with two rooms that two people share. the rooms are a bit small but the living room is a big empty space with a couch and a sad little table. 

me and 2 other girls got put into this dorm for gamers and then we had a guy as our 4th so they had to switch us for this last girl very quickly. she's nothing like us, which wouldn't be an issue if she wasn't how she is. 

the first issue that i had with her was the fact that she had the heat on in the dorm, but she got a heater for herself and that got worked out. 
the school has a wall in each dorm that they specifically let us draw on, it's strange but i like it. the 3 of us are illustration majors while this girl is a photography major. we started drawing on our wall and this girl made a fit about it, saying how we didn't ask if she'd be okay with it. 

she had a 'meeting' with us where she complained that we made the living room a 'gaming room' because my roommate brought her monitor out and plugged in my switch and we played super smash bros one night. it was super fun to me

this girl has had friends over but complains when i have mine over, and i heard her talking to her friends about us. i have a class with one of her friends and he just kinda gives me weird looks the whole time. when me and my roommate were walking, her friends were sitting on a bench talking and when we walked by they all stoped talking and gave us weird looks again. 

she's vegan, and yesterday sent a long message about how when we make meat we need to clean extremely well for her in the kitchen and stuff, which i understand but it was just so annoying how she she wrote it. 

well, last night i bought a fluffy black rug for the living room in our dorm. i thought it would look nice because of the big empty space. this girl went off. she said black is ugly and hides dirt, and i should have consulted everyone when getting a rug. i got this rug because me and the two other roommates went to target and she didn't wanna come with, and when we saw rugs we thought it would be cool to get one for the living room. when i was out, i picked one up with everyone's happiness in mind. i told her ""nobody consulted me over the dish soap"" and left. that was probably a bad thing to say but i was mad and sad.

she sent me a long text this morning about how i'm nasty for the soap and the black rug and immature and all these things. i'm just hurt honestly, but maybe i'm the asshole and she's reasonable.

am i the asshole?

update: i walked into the living room yesterday to the rug rolled up in a ball, so i just decided to put it in a corner as i didn't want to cause more drama. i sent her a message apologising and asking if we could talk like adults and she's been blatantly ignoring me and being very friendly in our roommate group chat as well as to the others in general. it's hard to just let this go as it makes me feel like trash. i genuinely miss living alone.

edit: i emailed the ra for my floor and he and i talked about the issues i was having, hopefully we'll have a dorm meeting with an ra to help and if she wants there's an option for her to move to a different dorm

edit 2: telling me to drop out of art school is not helpful in any way and your opinion is not wanted. i worked hard to get here and my college tuition was paid for by scholarships and the generosity of others. please respect my decision to be here.",3
"for breaking up a relationship between our son and a girl, who both have disabilities?. i honestly feel like the biggest asshole on earth.

i have a 16 year old son with severe physical disabilities. he uses a motorized wheelchair and requires help to get in and out of it.

my husband and i are in a friends group of families with similarly disabled children.

my son recently announced that he is dating a 17 year old girl from the group. my only problem is that this girl has severe mental and physical disabilities. she has the mental capacity of a young child, is mostly nonverbal and has tics that will cause her to hit other people in the vicinity.

my son has zero mental disabilities. i was very uncomfortable with this relationship because of the huge difference in mental capabilities. my husband felt the same but not as strongly. 

however, literally everyone in the group has been thrilled about this ""romance"". especially the girl's parents. they are talking about the two getting married for heaven's sake.

i thought that i'd just wait it out and have our son realize on his own that he cannot have a meaningful relationship with this girl.

but it's been 5 months and it's only getting worse.

i ended up putting my foot down and informed both my son and the girls parents that this relationship was completely inappropriate. especially since my son has now started being hit by the girl during her tics and he is physically unable to defend himself. my husband supported me in this.

we have become enemy number one ever since. the parents have attacked us through texts and have turned everyone in the friends group against us.

but the thing that has hurt us most is our son's reaction. he has accused us of ruining his one shot at love. 

we've been to family therapy but my son has decided to ignore us completely not give us the silent treatment. my husband and i have decided not to cave.

are we the assholes?",3
"if i plant thorny bushes around the edge of my property to keep children away. i live close to an elementary school. every day a small parade of children walk in front of my house on their way to and from school. my girlfriend and i just finished building a small retaining wall of brick along the sidewalk and have noticed it regularly being walked/climbed on. the wall is about three feet tall.

originally we were going to plant a lot of flowering bushes along the top of it but we're pretty sure they will be destroyed slowly by the daily coming and going of the kids. we also don't want to be liable for anyone falling and getting hurt. we were at home depot to buy flowers the other day when we saw some neat looking bushes that are also a bit pokey. that's when i got the idea to use them as a deterrent. so, will i be the asshole if i plant them along the top of the wall?

**thank you for the different plant suggestions! keep em comin! i live in a zone 7 climate.

** there seems to be a minority rising that think i'm out to fuck these kids over and that is very much not the case. i just don't want them climbing all over the wall, which is already happening. i used the term ""pokey bushes"" intentionally as i just want a *deterrent*. something that is more scary than damaging but will be effective if they actually try anyway. (lol, the people suggesting cholla catus!)

**due to demand, i'll try to post pictures when it's done. weather permitting and plant availability it should hopefully be done by wednesday.

\*\*here are the pictures of before and after.(https://imgur.com/a/llp70u9) sorry they're a little late; it was just my gf and i working on it. the pictures aren't super great and unfortunately, the plants are still quite small as they have just been planted. we're also not done landscaping this portion. need more fabric to stop weeds and we are going to put something over it(mulch or my gf wants some small black rocks). as for the pokey plants, the plant nearest to the camera is *wild rose* and following the wall we planted a few *lantana*. both of which should grow out over the wall in the next two years or so. behind those we have some random white flowers, some salvia and lavender. we then planted a little fig tree and two lilacs on either side of the front door. in the background to the right we planted a jasmine to grow alone the fence. if someone wants to remind me, i can take pictures again next year for some plant growth progress.",3
"for thinking about leaving my wife because she is adopting her nieces and nephew?. obvious throwaway because i have friends who know my personal account.

&#x200b;

so i've known my wife for 9 years, we dated for 5, and we've been married for just under 6 months.  she comes from an insanely toxic family, she was emancipated at 16 and to this day refuses to speak to any of her family. they are all addicted to meth and her sister to meth + anything she can get her hands on. her sister has 3 kids, ages 9 months (f), 6 years (m), and 13 years (f). my wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would. for whatever reason cps never took the kids away despite near constant monitoring and the last my wife knew of these kids was 3 years ago when she permanently cut her family off. 

&#x200b;

her parents always assumed she would adopt any children her sister produced (this actually was the beginning of the rift that led to her cutting her parents off) and were never shy about it. when we started dating (she was 15, i was 17) i told her that if she adopted those kids then the relationship wouldn't work out because if i am having kids they are going to need to be my own **(edit: my mind was going at a million miles per hour when i typed this. this is not an all-encompassing statement. when i typed it i was focused on my current situation. i would not be opposed to marrying someone with kids already, i just expected to never raise these children and i do not want to.)** . she agreed and said she had no desire to ever adopt those kids. 

  
i just deleted like 5 paragraphs worth of useless details because i'm just ranting. i will just get to the point, so out of the blue last week she tells me that she feels guilty about leaving the children behind and she is planning on reaching out to her sister to formally adopt them.  i told her hell no, i made it clear very early on that i do not want to raise those kids. she told me that she assumed i would ""grow out of it"" and accept them. we argued and have been arguing over and over for days now about her decision. she has since reached out to her sister and has started the process of adopting the children. the oldest girl is pregnant, the middle child is a decent kid, and the youngest one only got out of prenatal icu 5 months ago due to the mother's incessant abuse of drugs during pregnancy.   i am 22, she is 20. i think even if i wanted to adopt these kids i would still want to say no due to our age and financial situation (she works at a make up store, i work at a grocery store for fucks sake)

&#x200b;

i haven't straight up told her that i am planning on leaving yet but i've already told my parents that if she doesn't stop then that is my plan.  am i the asshole here?

"for correcting my title on a wedding rsvp card?. throwaway account because my boyfriend is a redditor.

i received a wedding invitation a few weeks ago addressed to ""mr. (boyfriend) and ms.

i was expressing my annoyance to our mutual male doctor friend, and found out that she addressed his invitation with the appropriate title.

the bride-to-be messaged me today to tell me that she thinks i'm being pretentious and that my correction was obnoxious. i didn't mention that i knew she had used the doctor title for our other male friend, but i was tempted.

so guys, aita?

"for refusing to kill the office spider despite one of my colleagues being scared of it?. i've had a spider in my office space for a few months now. she's a cool, small, little thing who chills near my desk and occasionally i bring her lil treats to eat. sometimes she disappears and sometimes she comes back. i've named her. i like her. 

my colleague michelle is aware of the spider, and is always complaining that it's a pest and needs to be killed. recently she saw the web, not even the actual spider, and started an official whiteboard scoresheet if anyone is in favor of the spider being removed. apparently she's super scared and terrified and being even a little bit close to my office is enough to make her jittery. 

luckily most people voted that the spider stays, but a few of her friends wrote some strongly worded notes that the spider is a sign of poor housekeeping etc. i must admit i was a little peeved at this, especially because we are a pet friendly workspace and michelle's own dog comes in to work sometimes and we have people who are genuinely frightened of dogs and michelle doesn't bother keeping her on a leash or anything. 

it came to a head when we had a meeting and michelle bought up that she refused to go into my office because of the spider and she was scared of it. my boss was a little irritated and told me to remove it or kill it, i straight up refused and told him he wouldn't ask michelle to remove her dog and the spider is a lot less threatening than a poorly behaved dog. he ultimately agreed and since then all she's done is go on about how i don't care about her feelings and that i must enjoy watching her suffer.",3
"for sending my family an angry email because they still speak to my ex-husband and even have him over, especially in light of his present ""relationship"" with a girl 20 years younger than him?. so basic background is i'm 42, two kids age 14 and 12 and signed divorce papers in april after almost 2 years of it being drug out trying to get my fair share from him. the details of ""why"" are not important but i'm angry, embarrassed, lost and sad any given moment of the day. a lot of this has to do with feeling like i've been ""replaced"" by a 23 year old surfing instructor who is everything i'm
not. my husband and kids claims that she is just his friend and helping him learn his life long desire to surf but jesus christ...give me a break. 
 

my husband has primary custody because he had better lawyers who were able to manipulate some minor missteps on my part into the court seeing them as a huge deal. so this past weekend i picked up the kids and said we were going to visit my parents. they said they would rather use thier season passes to sea world since they spent all weekend with my parents and aunt stacey and uncle brian (my brother and sister who i didn't even know were in town). i was like your dad took you? they said yes that my parents had invited him over to see everyone. i was devastated because while i don't get along with my brother and sister (and my mom) they let my ex-husband know they were coming and not me. i can't even let that sink in without tears forming. i sort of jested that ""oh and let me guess ms surf instructor was there too?"" my daughter said ""well actually we all went to her house in ocean beach because she gave stacey and brian lessons after ours."" that included my mom and dad. i was so devastated i took the kids back home and just went home and cried for an hour. 

when i was done i sent a furious email to my entire family how inappropriate they all had been and then not only hanging out with my ex for an entire weekend, but his little chippy as well is a massive slap in the face and the fact they didn't even tell they were in town let alone invite me makes me feel so alone. 

my mom was the only one to respond and she basically said ""yes it was rude we didn't tell you stacey and brian were  here and we shouldn't have done that. but we didn't divorce bradley, and we still see him as a son. this email along with your behavior over the last 5 years should really give you insight into why we might not want you at family events.""

"for throwing away my daughters vibrator. i have a 18 year old daughter who lives with me. she's in college so i let her live here rent free. i also have 3 other children who are 11, 6 and 2. my 11 and 18 year old share a bathroom, and the 6, 2 year old and myself use mine.

my daughters bathroom is currently out of order due to some pipes so we've all been sharing mine. 

my 18 year old daughter has been taking long long baths lately, and i know why. she's masturbating. it's uncomfortable but i want her to know her body.

but she's been leaving her vibrator on the counter when she leaves my bathroom. i've told her 4 separate times she needs to take it with her, because her siblings don't need to get a hold of it and if she keeps doing this i'm going to get rid of it.

this morning it was once again left on my counter, so i threw it away in the outside trash. 

she stormed into my bedroom while i was getting ready yelling at me about how dare i throw away something she paid for with her own money, and i'm just trying to shame her blah blah blah. 

it was a relatively expensive vibrator, and i do feel slightly bad about throwing it away instead of just reprimanding her again, but i feel like i had to because she wasnt listening.


for throwing away my daughters vibrator?

eta: i'm her mom. i'd be fucking mortified if i was her father and i knew my teenage daughter was masturbating in my bathtub. my husband and i are divorced.

eta #2: i thought about hiding it, but i know my child, she would get another one and keep doing it. doing something extreme like throwing it away was the only way to get my point across. while yes she is an adult and she bought it with her own money, she lives in my house with 0 bills, 0 responsibilities. she goes to school (which i'm so proud of) and she works part time. other than that, i care for all her needs. this is my house and my young children and she didn't respect my boundaries i tried to gently but firmly set the first time. maybe that makes me the asshole and i will full heartedly accept that.


last edit but i'm fixing the bathroom. i'm not just leaving it alone, but it takes a while. this has only been over the course of a week.

"for calling my girlfriend a gold digger?. i'm a 29 year old guy who finished residency two ago and am now a pediatrician making >160k.

i got tired of being single for most of my life so i downloaded a few dating apps and met this girl (26) who works in customer service for a huge company about 9 months ago. we hit it off and officially became exclusive three months ago.

overall she's a really great person. but there's a few things about her that bother me, and i'm not really sure if it's normal or not because i've never really been in an actual serious relationship.

-i always pay for everything on dates. i know that i make more than her and it doesn't necessarily hurt me to always pay, but she doesn't ever offer to pay or split the bill and she just expects me to always pay.

-the first time she came over to my apartment she was literally shocked. i live in a shitty one bedroom apartment because i want to pay off my student loans as fast as possible so i still basically live like a broke college student. she kept making comments about how i should move out and find a nicer place that suits a doctor.

-she wanted to introduce me to her family right away. i thought the relationship is too new to meet the parents but she insisted. and when we went to their house, her parents only asked about my job and salary.

-when we went out and ran into someone she knows she introduced me as her doctor boyfriend.

these things, plus some other stuff made me realize she doesn't really care about me, just that i'm a doctor. so i told her. she blew up, saying i'm insulting her and calling her a gold digger, and that she's just proud of me for being successful.

aita?

edit:
1)  i wanted to clear something up, my apartment is not dirty. when i said i live in a shitty one bedroom apartment i just meant that it's really small. poor wording on my part. 

2) i agree with a lot of you that i let my frustrations build up and then i just accused her instead of trying to talk to her. this is my first 'real' relationship so i have a lot to learn. 

3) it's true that she doesn't ask me for money or for expensive gifts. i'm starting to think i was too quick to assume anything.

"for taking my niece out of drama club because she failed pe?. my niece is living with my family and i due to some personal reasons. she moved in right at the end of the school year last year. this year, she started high school. in our state, you have to have two years of pe to graduate. my niece asked if she could do it online like my kids, and we said sure, no problem. 

the way the online program works is pretty simple. over a 180 day term (plus weekends) students must clock in 60 hrs of physical activity on a fitbit provided through the school. there aren't set exercises or anything like that. the students do whatever they want, and as long as the fitbit registers it, it counts. for example, my son and one daughter got theirs through sports, but my other daughter looks up dance routines on the computer. 

also, the 60 hrs can be divided however a student wants. they can do an hour a day and be done in two months, or they can do 20 minutes a day for the whole 180, or any other combination, as long as it gets done. there are smaller goals throughout the year, like 30 hrs by midterm in december and 15 hrs by the end of october. 

my niece hasn't met these goals. in fact, she hasn't registered a single minute of what the fitbit counts as real physical activity. and she says it's not a malfunction. she thought that walking to class and drama (even though by her own admission they mostly stand and read) would be enough. she said that between homework and drama, she didn't have time for exercizing. 

our house rule is if you fail a class, you're pulled from all extra curriculars, no matter your other grades. my wife and i called the school and told them we were pulling my niece from drama and why. 

now her parents are furious. her mom all but said it was abuse. my brother can't believe we'd pull her from something she loves so much w/o consulting them, even though when we asked for input on what classes to put her in, they said that we should trust our judgment.

i don't know. for pulling her out of it?


edit: i was unclear; my apologies. she has failed the class by not meeting this goal. they have officially removed her as of this evening. 

before anyone jumps on me, i didn't explain properly. the students can do as they wish with logging the time, as long as they meet each smaller goal.


edit 2: it seems most people think we are assholes, however, those people seem to be overlooking that two credits of pe are required for graduation. this class is not a simple elective which can be forgotten. as such, our punishment stands. she will stay out of drama until next year.

"for speaking english with my china relatives who refused to speak mandarin. background here. i am a 16 year old born with china parents and a china born sister who is 23 now. my parents migrated overseas to where we live now with my sister and had me, completely born in an english speaking environment. i can speak mandarin, but usually only at home, and i study in a school with english as first language. 


we went to my father's hometown in szechuan chengdu last month, and welcomed by our grandparents who threw a big reunion party with my uncles aunts and cousins, about 20+ people. they speak in szechuan dialect as their mother tongue, but are able to understand and speak mandarin too. while my parents(obviously) and sister(able to understand but can only speak mandarin) are comfortable with it, i have trouble understanding the dialect.


i tried to ask an uncle speaking to me to speak mandarin, but was responded with laughter, the other relatives also seemed to enjoy my confusion. that uncle, using mandarin, told me that i am a banana who has forgotten her roots before turning back to dialect. my parents told me not to act selfishly and expect everyone to change for me. it was awkward and frustrating to be the only one in a house of strangers(yups, relatives but strangers) who had no idea what others were saying. 


since they were comfortable, i figured i might as well as make myself comfortable too. when an aunt came to speak to me again, i responded in english, this time enjoying her confused face. even though i had no idea what they were talking about, i spoke english throughout the rest of the party.


i had an earful from my parents after that, they said that i was disrespectful and a walking form of embarassment and because of me they got scolded from my grandparents for teaching me to behave this way. my sister(secretly) supported me though, saying they had what was coming for teasing me like that. aita?",3
"for cussing out my in-laws for going through my luggage?. i recently got engaged and took some time off to visit our parents and start planning. first stop was mine and then his.

i suffer from chronic pain and take a variety of meds which cause a decrease in appetite and nausea. i haven't disclosed my illness to my in-laws, but a few nights ago i could hear her complaining about how i'm too good to eat what they cook. i let it go.

yesterday, fiance took me around his hometown. on the way back, he remembered to get beer, but we were already pulling into the driveway. i was tired, so he dropped me off. his parents were waiting for me in the living room, angry.

future mother-in-law - fmil: you really think you can pull the wool over our eyes, don't you? you think you can bring drugs into our house?!

me: *motioning to a seat because my legs hurt*

fmil: no no! you stand! how dare you bring this disgusting bullshit into our house!

i reach for my cellphone and she yells at me to keep my hands at my side.

fmil: i don't care how legal this stuff is. we don't allow this garbage in our house! *she pulls out a plastic wrapped package and i immediately know what it is.* my husband took a bite out of it and got sick! 

i'm pissed off right now because this was at the bottom of my luggage! and then she starts going off about how many pills i take (again, wouldn't know if you hadn't gone through my stuff) and how her son doesn't deserve a druggie. she takes my package and shows me where ffil took a few bites and threw up soon after.

it's been 10 minutes and my fiance is back. his mom asks him if he knows all the medication i'm on and how i brought pot into their house. he can't get a straight answer about how they know about my medicine, but then he glances at the package and just sighs.

fiance: mom, it's soap. even says african black soap.

he broke off a piece, headed to the kitchen, and washed his hands with it, showing them the lather. fmil fired back saying that she's never seen soap like that and that this doesn't explain the amount of meds i take. they say they're justified in what they did because they want the best for their son and since it's their house they can go through personal belongings at will.

i let them have it. i start screaming and cussing because i'm exhausted and tired. i can't remember everything i said, but my throat has been a mess from all of the screaming. ffil tried to give me back the soap, but i kind of threw it at him saying i didn't want his gum disease. terrible, i know.

we're staying at a hotel and not talking to his parents. i feel i could have gone about it better. i wanted a good relationship with my in-laws and we've always kind of gotten along... now i feel like i fucked up badly.

**tl;dr: future in-laws went through my luggage and mistook soap for an edible. i cussed them out and offended them and now i feel like i burned a major bridge.**

"for being unsympathetic to a trans guy that's mad at being dominated by cis guys on the swim team?. using a throwaway. 

so, there's a ftm trans guy at my school, let's call him don (since i'm watching mad men, lol) who recently came out as trans. he says he isn't transitioning using harmone therapy or anything of the sort to transition. as a girl, he was a pretty good swimmer on the team who did the 100m. he switched over to the male team. the coach casually told him the competition might be a little stiff (not in a harsh or transphobic way, more just 'you might want to be aware/prepare yourself' way). don nodded along and said that's okay.

but the way he's been acting recently shows he thinks it's anything except fair. since our swim team is pretty competitive (we're won state just last year), his times for the 100m fell to near the bottom of the pack. and he's been whining about this, calling it unfair and saying he should get a handicap of some sort. 

i disagree with this, partially. i do agree that it's unfair that he has to swim with cis guys as a biological female not undergoing transition. but he decided to join the male team, knowing the competition would be stiff. i know it may be have been triggering for him to stay on the girls team, but it's a trade-off: if he wants to be on the male team, he can hardly expect to be given advantages over other guys. 

one time, after practice when don was complaining, i civilly shared my opinion. he got offended at this.

"for buying my homeless brother a one way bus ticket to florida instead of taking him into my home (chicago area). it was my full intention to get rid of him.. hello r/aita. throwaway for what i hope are obvious reasons. 

this post is the product of years of family drama that basically all center around my brother. he was raised as the true ""golden child"" of the family, much to the detriment of my and my sister. we were a very upper middle class family and my brother was the center of the ""wrong crowd"" and his life is in absolute shambles. he is 24 now and if i had to guess, my parents have spent $500,000 on various colleges, rehab programs and facilities, actor's workshops, investment schemes and on and on. it could be a little less, it could be a lot more. the heartbreak of seeing my brother fail time after time had to be a major factor in my dad having a heart attack and dying at 63 four years ago.

my brother showed back up in chicago area last summer with a sob story about why he failed out of the last rehab my mom had paid for but this time he claimed he was ""voluntary"" homeless. my mom couldn't handle this so without checking with my or my sister, mom concocted this plan that the three of our households would ""take turns"" hosting my brother so he wouldn't have to be on the streets (my mom's new boyfriend, who is a decent guy, can't stand my brother and probably put his foot down to taking brother on full time). so when i was told about this and when my ""turn"" first came around i told my brother that in no uncertain terms that he could stay, but he had to come to work at my company, i had to be with him at all times and he had to pay his room and board through helping me with fix up our house.  he wanted no part of that and has chosen to be homeless during every two week period that he was supposed to come stay with me. i have not seen him since and since i know my mom and sister have not put a hard line on him, i know he is still using. 

well as the national news will tell you, we are in a massive deep freeze and of course this coincides with my two weeks to keep him. he showed up at my house on friday night when we started hearing just how cold it was supposed to get. i told him that he had four choices, he could avail himself of the services that the city was putting together and remain homeless, he could go back with my mom or sister, he could take me up on my offer to work and help around the house or i would buy him a bus ticket to florida to get out of the cold. 

well i don't think he caught the meaning of a one way bus ticket. what i know he thought was happening is that i was giving him a ticket to go party on the beach until the cold passed and then i would provide for him to come home. when i dropped him off at the bus station earlier in the week he point blank asked me ""when and how will you send the return ticket?""  i told him there was no return ticket, take what i was giving him or stay in the cold.  he proceeded then to unleash an angry cursed filled rant accusing me of every family sin under the sun until i kicked him out of my car. i know he got on the bus, beyond that i have no idea what happened to him and i care even less. 

edit: he absolutely knew i was giving him a one way ticket. sorry for the confusion. he just thought this was an open ended party in florida and i would be sending him a return ticket when he was ready to come home. there was no illusion or subterfuge on my part about the ticket. 


my mom is outraged at me, to the point where she is talking about suing me for ""great bodily harm"" (whatever that is supposed to mean), cutting me out of her will and estate and even telling my wife she'll introduce her to divorce attorneys. my sister has quietly thanked me because she wasn't sure how she was going to break it to my mom that she wasn't taking my brother in anymore because her fiance was sick of him. 


so from the view of my mom, i am not only an asshole, i have apparently put my brother's life in danger. 


from me and my sister's view i have washed our hand's of a long standing problem, at least for a little while. 


so, am i the asshole?


edit2: wow this is easily my biggest post ever, by a large margin. i have about 410 unread posts as of this morning. i very much will try to read all of them. 

there's one thing i just want to address really quickly. people are saying ""yta"" because i blame my dad's heart attack on my brother. surely you can say that my dad may have had a heart attack sooner or later but he died at 63 years old. other men on his side of the family have lived well into their 80s and 90s (my dad's dad is still alive as an example, my two greatgrandfathers lived to 98 and 102 as another example). there is no doubt in my mind that stress of having to deal with my brother absolutely contributed to his poor health. i am no doctor but the links between stress and heart trouble are pretty well established and it got so bad at the end that my dad's own cardiologist  was advising him that he had to let my brother go or it would kill him. my dad died after a series of small heart attacks and ""big one"" that started occurring after he went to somewhere in new mexico and rescued my brother who was prostituting himself for meth and heroin, all while my parents were sending him something like $3500 a month for living expenses to get himself ""back on track."" to me the link is so absolute that i feel 100% justified in blaming my brother for my dad's death. you can judge me all you like but the pictures of how my dad changed from a robust man in his late 30s when my brother was born to a broken shell by the time he died would maybe change your judgement.

"for not wanting to feed my ex-wife?. my ex and i have two boys (7 and 11) and we have 50-50 custody. every thursday she comes to my house to pick them up for her time. i noticed more and more food was gone, but not for sure. i was able to confirm that food was going missing because someone drank my last can of ginger ale. i asked my sons' sitter if he knew anything about it and he said my ex drank it. i was confused. apparently, when my ex comes to pick up them up, she'll start making a snack for herself like she lives there. i thought about it and want it to stop.

the issue is that she is unemployed and has no money. i believe she is hungry. it's not about the money or cleaning up after yourself - it's about boundaries.

edit - i do pay her child support, $300 a month. i make 90k a year and she makes 45k a year. however, i pay for the kids' tuition and cover their insurance. i believe that my ex is barely breaking even at the end of each month and lives paycheck-to-paycheck. she lost her job back in august and just found something in october so that fucked her finances up. 

that's not my problem though.  

my problem is that she just welcomes herself to my food. literally, the stuff she eats is the food that i buy for myself. for example, my diet ginger ale. it pisses me off that i come home and want to have a nice cold ginger ale with my dinner only to find that the last few were drank. and when she uses a plate, she'll rinse it off but doesn't dry it or even put it in the fucking dish washer.",3
"for running through neighborhoods in the early morning, making security lights come on and dogs bark?. i (26f) like to go for a run in the morning before i go to work. i usually set out around 5:00 am so i can make sure to get at least 5 miles in at a time before having to get ready for work. well depending on the time of year, i'm either running around sunrise or wrap up before, which means that people in the neighborhood have those security lights that pop up if you're in the area.

well people started complaining about their lights being triggered and their dogs flipping out at early times, and people on their stupid doorbell cameras will look at people going by and several people posted videos of me running by. i'm identifiable because i have a headlamp and flashers to make sure cars see me.

this was on that nextdoor app so i chimed in to say hey, sorry about that! and got dogpiled by people telling me to change up my route, or have more respect. some people told me to go to a gym, why don't i run in the afternoon or evening etc etc. i told them i had no way of remembering whose house has what lights or what dogs and that it's just something we all have to deal with. i'm not going around complaining about the sprinklers that come on and drench me because they aren't calibrated right! and then said that i love to run in the morning because it makes me feel good through the day to which someone said ""yeah try getting woken up by some smartass who won't be neighborly enough to just go to the gym!""

anyway i've gotten some really nasty notes and people keep posting videos of me and comments saying that i should really get a gym membership and other people calling me rude because the dog barks and wakes up the baby or something. i don't enjoy running on a treadmill. never have, never will. besides why pay out the ass to be leered at and hit on by gross dudes when i can run in the darkness and watch the sun rise? seems like a no-brainer, right?

my best friend has suggested i just head out later, but i won't have enough time for the rest of my routine (shower, breakfast, etc) if i do that.

&#x200b;

eta: tried to grab all the info questions. 

1 - there are no parks nearby large enough for me to run in. the only one around here is about one block, and it is surrounded by houses. i pass this park already. there are no ""trail systems"" or anything like that either. 

2 - i don't run the same exact path every day. no matter which street i run on, there's inevitably security lights and dogs. i have 5 or 6 different routes i'll take. i don't think it's even the same dogs barking at me on those routes. 

3 - i don't have a car, so i can't just drive out somewhere else. 

4 - again, i'm not getting a gym membership. my budget doesn't include that kind of luxury, and the closest affordable gym here is about 6 miles away to begin with. 

5 - i can't run later in the morning. i have to be out the door at a certain time to get my full 5 miles in.  5:00-630, exercise (warm up and cool down included). 6:30-7:30, getting ready (shower, coffee, breakfast, put together lunch or it's already made, makeup, hair, getting dressed). if i don't leave for the bus at 7:45, i will not get to work on time.

"for wanting my friend to stop singing k-pop and mimicking anime in public?. so i have this friend that i introduced to anime and k-pop a while back. a few months later, he's obsessed with them and i would consider him a full-on koreaboo and weaboo. for example, he says ""ban-kai"" (a power from bleach) out of nowhere and i feel a sense of disappointment for what he has become. as well as when we are in uni he starts singing k-pop songs without knowing those actual lyrics. i just want my old friend back, not the one that would say ""nani"" after everything i say. i can't bear to confront him about it since i'm the one that introduced him to it, but the amount of cringing i do a day is detrimental to my well-being.

"for essentially breaking up with my ex-girlfriend because she didn't behave at a gathering?. i couldn't think of a better, more neutral way of putting it, but that's essentially what happened..so yeah.

i dated her for about 3 months. she was really gorgeous ,confident and free spirited. i loved how silly and bold she was, it was something that made her really unique in my book. 
this whole thing happened a month ago. i had a really, really big presentation and i got really tensed. i had the opportunity to invite my gf to the function, and so i did, on the condition that she would not embarrass me and not drink, because she had a habit of drinking a lot during such occasions and losing control. 

well, turns out she made fun of me just because she thought it was hilarious. she burped loudly when i was talking to my co workers, and told about how i didn't even have sex because of the stress. she proceeded to ask my coworkers if they could resist her body. they were obviously uncomfortable too. the presentation ultimately went horribly bad at first because she kept making stupid silly faces backstage, but then i just ignored her for the rest of the night and all went well.

first thing i did when we sat in the car was saying i was breaking up with her that night, she told me she was just trying to lighten my mood. i refused to let her touch me then, and dropped her off to her building. she said she wasn't going to go till we sorted out the issue, i just told her to get out.
 then i gave her a text message saying i was sorry for being rude to her but we weren't compatible, and to just move on with her life.

fast forward to today, i bumped into a friend of hers who said that i had been an asshole for her to break up with her for being 'silly' at a gathering, and that no one could believe i turned out to be such a jerk.

now i am already seeing someone, but this interaction made me question if i had indeed been a jerk. an unbiased opinion would help.

"for asking my girlfriend to stop talking about her period because it's gross?. throwaway for obvious reasons

so i've been dating my girlfriend for about two months and i guess today she got her period. she mentioned it slightly and said something about bleeding through her underwear. 

i asked her to stop talking about it because i thought it was gross.

she told me she understood, but i should know these things since we're dating.

i told her i didn't need to know anything about it because i'm not a girl and it's not my responsibility.

she told me that she understood and would just keep things like that to herself, but her friend called me an asshole.

edit: we are both 16 

edit 2: we aren't sexually active as she is uncomfortable with it. so it doesn't really seem like it's my responsibility for what her body goes through. 

edit 3: okay, i understand now, i am the asshole. i will try my best to maybe learn more about it and keep my mouth shut. i do really like this girl, but it was just something i was grossed out by. but i will start trying to be a better boyfriend.

thank you for the advice 

edit 4: i didn't think this would blow up as much as it did. and i get that i wasn't being open minded, but i am willing to help her through the pain she feels and buy her snacks and cuddle her into oblivion and all that. just, if she does complain about bleeding, i hope she keeps it to a minimum.

so reddit, aita?

update:

as there are quite a few more comments than i had expected i thought it would be nice to give you guys some extra info and an update.


first i wanted to say that me (21f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been together for over a year now. he is the best bf in the world and i love him very much. both of us have not had any previous relationships, so we still encounter new things regularly and we are still learning.


secondly, i understand that not everybody likes cum. that's why i had already flushed my mouth with water before i came back for a kiss. especially since i know my boyfriend can be quite squeamish sometimes. after this i just felt kind of rejected because the idea of kissing me disgusted him so much.
i asked him after reading the comments if he felt like i pressured him into something he didn't want to do and i apologized. pressuring him was definitely not my intention, i would never want to do that to him. he said he didn't feel that way and that he was sorry too for making me feel rejected.


whatever your verdict may be, thank you all for your comments!",3
"if i go to hr over jesus propaganda at work?. edit: thanks y'all! i'm not going to talk to any higher-ups unless something like this happens again. i've read many helpful comments and many ridiculous ones, the only thing i feel i need to clarify is that i keep my joking about religious iconography confined to ranty posts on the internet. in fact i just avoid talking about religion in general unless it's with my husband, since most of my nearest and dearest are christians as well. some of you also got the reference, so thanks for not immediately accusing me of being one of ""those atheists""! 

so last night at work, it was pretty clear that my manager was stressed out/in a bad mood. during our startup meeting, she was discussing how much work we had to do, improvements we needed to make, and the fact that no one was meeting production goals. next week is the beginning of peak season, so essentially she was telling us to get our shit together. after her speech, an older lady who was working overtime and from another shift, said, ""after all that we need some good news! i've got some good news for y'all!"" 

when my manager asked her what the good news was, she said, ""jesus is coming back!"" now, i found this pretty annoying, but it has less to do with the fact that i'm an atheist and more to do with us being at *work*. i'm used to people inappropriately inserting jesus into random conversations or assuming everyone around them is a christian (born and raised in georgia), so i rolled my eyes but knew there was no point in voicing my opinion. plus, my manager responded with, ""amen,"" along with one of my coworkers. safe to say there were more people on the older lady's side than mine. 

this is where it gets worse and where i actually got offended, or rather uncomfortable. after the meeting, when we were all getting our equipment out and getting to our various stations, the older lady came up to me. only me, from what i saw. she stuck out her hand to give me some jesus propaganda, and when i tried to refuse (nicely, all i said was no thank you in a pleasant tone), she insisted and said that i needed it. i'm assuming she saw me roll my eyes at her comment during startup. 

i really did not appreciate this at all, and her singling me out like that changed my mind on the whole ""no point in voicing my opinion"" thing. my husband, who works at the same place in another department, was also pretty pissed about it. 

i don't think there's much point in asking my manager to talk to this lady, because she is very much a christian judging by her southern curly-scripted bible verse t shirts and her lowercase t necklace. my husband says i should bring this up to hr so that someone can tell this lady how not okay it is to confront someone with religion in the workplace. 

so, if i do? there's a big chance that hr and everyone i work with will think i'm an asshole.",3
"for telling my sister about her husband's creepy af novel about me?. hi. made a new throwaway account to post this because i am... wildly conflicted right now.

**backstory:** my sister (4 years younger than me) and her husband have been married \~2yr, together for 5. bil and i dated during high school, and it ended under circumstances that were not ideal. bil and i have not gotten along since he and sister got together. my sister essentially believes i'm jealous of her for marrying my ""one who got away"" (he is not that), so our relationship has also suffered as a result. this whole situation is already fucked up and yes, i'm pretty sure it's putting my therapist's kid through college, but that's not the problem right now.

recently bil has begun reaching out to me more frequently. i've been very cautious but after talking it over with people in my own life, chose to be more friendly toward him as part of an attempt at repairing certain aspects of my relationship with the entire family. last week bil asked if i would read a book he had written, with the underlying implication that i would help him career-wise with his aspirations as a writer. out of politeness and curiosity, i said sure, thinking i would perhaps get a good laugh out of it and a story to tell my publishing friends.

the book... is about us. i don't know how else to put it. it's a ""domestic thriller"" (so think *gone girl, you,* etc.) about a man who realizes he has married ""the wrong sister"" and becomes obsessed with his sil. it's one of the weirdest things i have ever seen. it doesn't exactly read like a manifesto, more like something you'd see on r/menwritingwomen, but aspects of the story were deeply unsettling to me personally (touching on things that happened to me in high school and later), and i don't understand why he would give this to me to read unless he wanted to either creep me out, or - as in the story - he intends to leave my sister and wanted to see if this would... jesus, it's too weird to say. open a door with me?

here's how i'm conflicted. people have always used art as a form of cathartic healing. if a stranger handed me this book, i would just say ""not my taste"" and move on. that said, this is my sister's husband, and i found certain elements so skin-crawlingly uncomfortable that i almost didn't finish it. that also said, this is my sister's husband, and i am afraid, based on the past, that if i tell her about this, she will flip out on me and not him, and/or if she confronts him, he will also just lie about the whole thing? and on the off-chance that it's more than just tasteless catharsis, i don't want my sister to get turned into a skin suit? (there are no skin suits but you get it.) and if it is just a fictional fantasy thriller, i'll either look like a paranoid asshole or the lawmakers who tried to ban video games after columbine.

**tldr: my bil and i dated in high school and he wrote a really creepy novel about being obsessed with me and i don't know whether to tell my sister for the shitstorm it could cause.**

""yesterday doesn't sit well with me, your attitude towards it is controlling, and the fact you're not willing to even explore compromises is troubling. for instance, the few times i eat or cook meat could be done when you aren't home, i could get a small bar fridge to store meat, there's a million solutions that could have been discussed if you really wanted this to work. your attitude surrounding it is controlling and unreasonable, i am asked to make incredible sacrifices because you're unable to compromise, or unwilling to. this will become a pattern, because you know i want this more than you, and you won't have to compromise cause i'll cave to have our family.

you have a right to state how you feel, as i do. if you choose to ignore my feelings entirely up to you. but the lack of communication about this isn't going to change anything. i want you and this family, but i'm not rolling over and changing every time you decide you believe in something else, compromise is a two way street, and if we aren't going to walk it together as equals, in ideas, feelings, respect, and communication, then we say goodbye now. ""

**addition: i feel like i should add this reply i made to a militant vegan here **

~~https://reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/d2bg73/_/ezuc01f/?context=1~~

i replied to the wrong comment and now i can't find it.

**update 2:** all she's said to me is ""i'm dreaming of a future that i won't have. "" not sure what that means but i don't want to go down any more rabbit holes today. i think i'll try tomorrow evening to talk to her, i'll give her time to consider my words abs to collect her thoughts. right now i want to think about everything that's been said here, specifically about my younger child being vegan, my family, what's best for everyone, and most importantly what kind of future do i see with her right now.  i've read every comment, and this has turned into a very spirited debate. i believe there's merit to reducing meat intake for your health and for the environment, but i don't believe in extreme knee jerk reactions to anything. i have reading to do..

**thoughts:** i am not criticizing vegans, and in the reply (to the wrong comment) that's causing me to get hate mail, i was referring to a specific subset of vegans, i would have expressed similar sentiments to a religious fanatic that was forcing his or her beliefs to me. 

i support her right to live the life she wants, and to eat what she wants. i want the same accommodation. 

was i the asshole here? imho yes in some ways i was. is she the asshole for the ultimatum? possibly. what i know for sure is i don't think i'll ever understand how this ""lifestyle"" and diet is a reasonable justification to change the nature of the family at its core. 

some have called me a pushover, that may be true, but i'm trying my best to navigate waters that are unfamiliar to me, and to make the best decisions for me and my family.

i am reading most of your comments, and to those who say i'm being intolerant, i'm not, i'm seeking compromise. to those who say a child should be raised as a vegan, i agree and have from the start, that choice was made unilaterally and the safe guards and information gathering  we agreed to hasn't happened.",3
"for letting my friend fall when she did that stupid trust fall bullshit?. i guess you could say from the title i'm the asshole but hear me out.

guys, i'm not exaggerating when i say she does this ""trust fall"" crap at least 19 times over an hour time period when we're hanging out. she always makes sure it's when i have my arms full, am sitting down, or am eating. basically at the most inconvenient times. it's actually obnoxious as fuck and i've told her at least 10 times to not be ""that"" guy and that it's annoying and unfunny. so naturally she does it more to piss me off.

we were hanging out after i had wrestling practice, which is super tiring, of course. i was stretching out on the couch and she was sitting in a beanbag chair. i heard her get up and when i heard her call out ""trust fall!!!"" like the smug fuck she is, i didn't even get up. she fell on her back onto a carpeted floor, but it was a cushioned fall because she realized i wasn't getting up to catch her. no, she didn't hit her head. she even kept her upper back from hitting the ground by using her arms.

she immediately got up and demanded to know what the fuck is wrong with me and that she could have been seriously injured. i told her the truth, that i'm sick of her shit and she knows she's just doing that trust fall monkeyshit to get on my nerves. she left in a huff.

i've gotten mixed reactions from my friends. i probably know the answer already, but aita?

edit: y'all, i know she's into me. she told me she likes me awhile ago and i told her i'm not interested and actually into someone else. this stupid falling behavior worsened afterwards. also some people ask our age - we're 15. we are in fact dumb teenagers.",3
"for making my mil pay for food i ordered after she ruined the one we had?. my wife and i were hosting a barbecue on sunday. half an hour before the guests arrived we were busy preparing food and my mil was helping us.

while i was busy doing something else i asked my mil to take the pasta salad i had prepared out of the fridge and taste for seasoning. she said that it needed more salt and i told her to add it, but not use the big salt shaker we have, because too much comes out of it. she used it anyways and oversalted the dish. i was really angry and tried to fix it with more mayo but it just didn't taste good. i told my mil that i would have to order a new pasta salad from a local place, which she said wasn't necessary but i did anyways. about 15 minutes after the guests arrived i see the delivery guy at our front door. i tell my mil to get up and she asks why. i tell her that the delivery guy is here so she can pay him. she looks at me stunned and asks ""why should i pay him"". so i have to expain that because she ruined the pasta salad she has to pay for the new one. she finally gets up to pay him but it's incredibly awkward and my wife is giving me the death stare. the guests seem kinda awkward too and my mil didn't talk to me at all for the rest of the party.

after the guests were gone my wife flipped her shit at me. she called me an imbecile and an asshole and said that i embarassed myself and damaged the realationship to her mother. it's been three days and she's still angry about this. aita?

edit: ok, i think the judgement has been clear. i will try to fix it, although i'm not sure yet how to.  

i also wanted to say that it wasn't my intention to emberass mil, i hoped that she would get up so i could explain it to her in private.",3
"for banning fast food from the house because of my diet?. y'all, i used to be 430 lbs and over the last 6 months i've lost nearly 160 lbs. i'm the smallest i've ever been my adult life and i am loving it. 

my husband and i have been married 7 years and he has been super duper supportive and loving and encouraging, but he is also on the husky side and the man looooooves his fast food every week or so. 

i have been craving mcdonald's, kfc, all that gorgeous greasy fatty goodness and because my diet is doing so well i put a blanket ban on all fast food in the house. 

at first my man was 100% for it and told me whatever made my life easy but for the last month or so he's been wanting to get fast food and i've told him he's welcome to go eat out or in the car but it's not coming in the house. he's been getting frustrated with me and said it's his house too and he should be allowed to eat kfc without me telling him 'no'. in fairness to him he's respected the rule and i know for a fact he's not snuck it in the house. 

i love him and really do feel bad but my friends are really encouraging and keep telling me he needs to deal with it. am i really a monster? should i just relent and let him get the occasional fast food?

edit: guys i'm deeply humbled by your responses. platinum?! silver!?? i don't deserve that. there so many more interesting posts on here but i have cried tears of happiness over how amazing each of y'all on here are!! thank you. i am grateful.",3
"for asking a fat lady to give up her seat to a late pregnant mother and her so. so i was on the bus yesterday and it was packed. but this lady was so big that none was able to sit next to her. now i had a seat on the bus for a while but as a student i give up my seat to other people as thats my schools expectation. but the entire time i had been on the bus this lady had been sitting in a 2 person seat by herself. now when i get on its already full with many people normally standing and it really got on my nerves that this lady had the audacity to take up 2 seats. but when a lady who was deep into her pregnancy and her so got on the bus it really annoyed me. after 2 or o minutes and no one had offered them or her alone i worked up the strength to ask her if she would get up and give her seat to the couple.

&#x200b;

thats where i stuffed up. so i asked her politely if she would give up her seat so the lady didn't have to suffer with the pregnancy as badly. (something along the lines of ""excuse me ma'm would you mind giving up your seat so the lady over there could sit down so its a less unpleasant experience for her, if you could i'm sure they would greatly appreciate it)

apparently this was super rude and she got really offended and started shouting that i was 'fatphobic' and rude and that she would report this slight to my schools headmaster and get me suspended or expelled.

"for deleting my moms facebook posts?. okay so to start this off, i'm currently in recovery from multiple mental illnesses including anorexia. 
     so when i was first diagnosed i was pretty much immediately sent to a residential hospital for a few months and i explicitly told my mom that i didn't want her telling people besides close family friends and relatives, and she agreed. fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and i'm scrolling through my moms facebook trying to find a specific family photo i was looking for when i see multiple posts along the lines of:
    today we had to check our beautiful daughter into veritas for treatment of her ed. please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)
     this especially pissed me off because i'm not a religious person at all. also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 facebook friends, most of whom i've never met. all i could think about was random people i've never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing i can't stand is people pitying me. 
     my mom uses the same password for everything so i knew her facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. she still hasn't noticed. 

update: damn i didn't expect this to get that many responses! just to clarify my mom definitely didn't have any ill-intent. we're very close and while we have occasional disagreements such as this one, generally she's very supportive. i definitely think we both made mistakes in this situation. thank you all for your input!",3
"for kicking a girl out of our body acceptance support group ?. i'm one of the two people in charge of running a body acceptance support group, we hold meetings for free at a community center after closing hours every saturday. we don't have a sign up process, you can just show up, write down your name and sit down to share. we make it clear that our support group is made strictly for people with body deformities, amputations, severe scarring, disfigurations of some sort... it is not for people who struggle with self esteem and need a boost.

at our first august meeting, a girl showed up whom we'll call ashley. there wasn't anything visibly ""wrong"" with ashley, but we didn't give it much thought since in some cases the scarring or whatever else can be hidden underneath clothes. (in my case, a long sleeved shirt hides nearly all of my upper body burn scarring). however, whenever ashley spoke, she would never mention what she was struggling with just that she was disgusted with her body. the first two sessions, i thought it was fine, to each their pace and i didn't want to force her to share anything she wasn't comfortable with sharing. even when we would wrap up the meetings and the members would chat to each other, she didn't reveal what exactly it was that made her seek out our support group.

at our third meeting, ashley showed up wearing a crop top and very short shorts, and again there was nothing visibly ""wrong"". she dodged every question i directed towards her asking about why exactly she was here, asking her if she was a veteran, if she had a surgery... she left quickly when we wrapped up and i couldn't speak with her. other members asked me what the deal with her was since she went on an other tangent about how disgusting her body was when it was her turn to speak without talking about what her physical defect was exactly or how it was impacting her day to day life.

last saturday's meeting, i approached ashley before the meeting to voice my concerns alongside those of the rest of the members. ashley responded saying we weren't very ""nice"", and that whenever she would speak up negatively about her body and such, we would never counter her with a compliment, we would just stay silent or tell her some ""mumbojumbo"" about how it takes time to come to terms with it. i was getting pretty angry, and i directly asked her why is it that she was here, and i told her if she couldn't give me an answer i'm afraid i would have to kick her out. she didn't answer so i asked her to leave. 

she contacted my co-runner (he organizes and plans timings, deals with the community center...) and he seems to think what i did is not justified, and that i shouldn't turn away anyone or kick them out because of the way they grieve or deal with trauma. when i tried to explain that i doubted she had any physical defects to begin with, he shut it down saying i'm being an asshole for judging someone as not ""disabled enough"".

am i the asshole for kicking her out?",3
"not moving out?. so i've (29f) lived in this apartment for the best part of a decade now. i don't own it but i've been saving up because i'm on good terms with my landlord who has agreed to sell it to me for a good price in the next few years since he's starting to get a little bit too old to deal with upkeep.

during this time i've had roommates rotating in and out to help afford rent. the latest roommates are a couple, dan (24m) and jess (25f).

a few months ago they announced that jess was pregnant and due in a couple of months!!! i was really surprised because, i feel mean saying this, she wasn't showing very visibly through her body shape. i congratulated them but when i asked what their plans were for their future family home they said they were hoping that i would move out. i said that goes against my plans that i've had for years and that i was planning on staying here. they insisted that i would ""have"" to move out as they're a new family now and need space. i told them that was great and i respect that need but if they wanted space they would need to find a new place as i was here first.

shit got pretty cold from there. we haven't really talked much, until now. they had the baby and it's now about a month old. i knew i'd have to bunker down a bit so i took all of my things from the common area (tv, consoles, kitchenware, etc) and with some work i got a pretty nice compact setup in my room with some diy soundproofing and a makeshift kitchenette so i can ignore the baby's crying. they used my stuff previously and were not happy at all and had to beg on facebook until someone got them new dishes, making sure to shit talk me in all the posts which i thought was pretty rude but whatever.

because i found out so late about the pregnancy, we're still on the lease for a good 6 months. they want me to break the lease so they can focus on their family. i told them that as i said before this wasn't going to happen. either they break the lease or they put up with me living my life the way i want to, which includes having people over, listening to music, smoking weed (legal state), drinking, etc. they said they can't afford to break the lease. i said that's unfortunate but neither can i. they said it would be easier for me because i'm not a parent and that i would just need to scrimp a little bit so i can afford to pay two rents. i said maybe but i'm not going to hamstring my lifestyle because they chose to inconvenience everyone around them with their kid. i was admittedly kind of the ah for saying this but i was being harassed.

so my living situation has been kind of a cold war ever since. it's really miserable for everyone right now and while i don't expect them to drop out of the lease i'm kind of hoping they do because them and their banshee kid are really giving me a headache. but i've invested too much into getting this place to leave so even if they stick it out i plan on signing the lease again and maybe seeing if the landlord will be able to not renew them.",3

"for correcting my date who thought that ben franklin was a president?. i usually think i have a pretty good grasp of social situations but maybe i fucked up.

i ask her ""whose your favorite president?""

""hmm. it would have to be jfk, ben franklin, and obama in that order.""

""oh, but ben franklin wasnt president.""

""what?""

""he wasn't president. he was a founding father though and its a mistake a lot of people make.""

""maybe its a mistake that you made? because i guarantee you he was.""

""no, he really wasn't im serious."" i think its still light so i laugh.

""ok, one sec."" she smirks and reaches into her purse/wallet thing and pulls out a 100 dollar bill.

""who does that look like to you?""

""ben franklin?""

""ha, there you go!""

i now realize she thinks you need to be a president to be on dollar bill.

""you know hamilton wasnt president and is on a bill?""

""google it! google it!"" she shouts in like a fed up laughing tone.

so i do and recite the wikipedia article on how ben franklin was never president.

"for threatening to not allow my children to visit my parents alone if they don't stop trying to convert my children to christianity?. my wife and i are raising our children without religion. we've taught them it's a thing that exists and always answered questions about it as honestly and truthfully as possible ""they believe x... etc."", but we don't want to push one on them and try to limit exposure outside of media and other people freely practicing. 

my parents are devout christians and love our children just as much as we do. i can count on one hand the people i trust with my kids and they're on the list. 

however, they simply don't respect the boundaries my wife and i have set, assumedly because they believe they're saving my children from the eternal damnation they couldn't save me from. i feel their hearts are in the right place,  but the last time they visited for summer (we live in a different state from my parents) they came back speaking like we'd been raising them as christians from birth. ""god says this and that"", etc.  

the most recent conversation went like this: 

""why don't you believe in god, daddy?""

""because he's not real sweetie.""

""but grandma and grandpa say he is!""

"for sending a tinder asshole to mcdonald's?. i'm using an alt for obvious reasons. 

for backstory, i'm female and live in the u.s. i'm on dating apps and i'm finding that a lot of guys are just disrespectful. some of them are polite and want to start an actual conversation, but a lot, maybe even the majority, are just ridiculous.

a lot of the messages i get are ""wanna fuck?"" or ""what are you looking for?"" which is their way of indirectly saying ""i want sex with minimal effort"". i even have in my profile that i don't do random hookups, but i think i overestimated how often people actually read the profiles.

after having this happen a dozen times, i finally snap. a guy on tinder messages me and the conversation seems to be going okay at first. we message back and forth and then i don't hear a response. that's okay, people get busy. 

at around 11:30 pm he hits me with the ""sorry, i got busy. what are you up to? wanna have some fun?"" during our initial conversation i make it crystal clear, i'm not looking for hookups. i don't to casual sex. so i remind him of this, and he starts negging me. ""i knew you'd be a prude"", ""not sure why you wasted my time"", ""let's just meet up at my house and talk and see where things go."" 

finally i was like, ""okay, but come to my house."" and then i proceed to give him the address of a mcdonald's. in the next town over. i waited for him to get close to the location, he confirmed that he was about 5 mins away, and i unmatched him.

"for demanding my sister and her boyfriend pay me back for drinking my whisky.. my sister started living with me recently and pays me reduced rent. i was away from home for about a week due to work. i gave her a simple rule of forbidding her bringing anyone over. not her new boyfriend or her friends. no exceptions to this rule. well she broke that rule.

during my week away. one of her instagram posts showed her bf wearing one of my jackets on a night out. i called her out on it and she apologised and told me she put everything back. so now i know that he has been in my room and going through my things. 

what killed me inside was that she also had a party. lots of drinking involved. including my vintage whisky. they cost me around £7000 and were near full. so i demanded that they pay me back. 

my sister is begging me that she didn't know and thought her boyfriend bought them. her boyfriend blocked me and called me crazy. he is now thinking about breaking up with her over this. everyone i know is calling me an asshole for demanding they cover my loss. apparently i should forgive a simple mistake. so aita?",3

we can't go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. when we're out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we're doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. at dinner, i always have to wait after we pay so she can go. at night, she'll get up while i'm sleeping etc etc. i know she can't help it, and she's only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it's seriously gotten on my nerves a ton.

"if i asked for a dna test?. about eight years ago i went to a friend's wedding. while i was there i wound up having a drunken one-night stand with an old friend i went to school with.

the next morning i woke up to her crying, she said she was in a serious relationship and our hookup was a big mistake. i instinctively apologized, but she insisted it was all her fault, and i had no reason to apologize. i gave her my word that i will keep quiet about things, and this would just be our secret.

i've kept my word for years. i never said nothing to anyone, i've actually almost forgot about it myself. 

about a month ago, i was scrolling through facebook when i seen something that shook my whole world up. i seen a picture of my daughter sitting on some random guy's lap. after a doubletake and a thorough inspection, i realized this was not my daughter. i realized that it was my old friend's husband and their daughter.

the resemblance is uncanny those girls are almost twins. the math adds up and, my thoughts have been driving me crazy for a month now. i want to say something, i feel like i need to know the truth. i need to put my mind to rest. i don't want to break a family, but after my mom passed away, i found out that me and my children are at high risk for colon cancer. if she is my child, i feel like this is something she needs to know.

"for denying my terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother?. i don't want a baby. i never wanted a baby. we are 24 and 25. she is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.

when she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact i don't want one wasn't an issue. now she is looking into other methods that could work. 

this woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. i feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. 

that said, i think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, and my dying wife. just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby i never wanted with a dead mother. 

my father died when i was 3, i wouldn't wish it on anyone. i don't want that for my child. i watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.

 i know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. is it selfish that i don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? 

i just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, i don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. 

as you can probably tell by reading this, i can be a bit of a prick. but i don't think i'm being a prick right now. let me know.

update: first of all i'd like to apologise, i mislead you, my so and i are recently engaged, not yet married. i said, wife, because i realise that a very large section of the people who read this would tell me to leave the relationship because being in the same headspace is essential for marriage. if she leaves me because she wants a family then i understand, but it's not an option i'm considering. 

i love her massively, i don't think she is interested in heading back onto the dating scene, and oxygen tanks can put some guys off. i've promised her i will look after her and i'm not going back on that. - im really sorry about that guys, i was trying to narrow down the advice to just yes or no rather than reading through loads of comments telling me to gtfo, but i accidentally made some people question if this was real - and by extension question their faith in humanity.... 

secondly, when my so and i met shortly before she was diagnosed and told that a baby was off the table, so we headed towards our future assuming that we were on the same page. 

thirdly, many people are asking what her illness is, i wasn't going to say because i was worried she would find the post and get upset. but because this thread is becoming so popular i think its a good opportunity to raise awareness about a very rare illness called pulmonary hypertension. you can read about it here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/causes/

finally i would like to thank all of you. almost without acception, you have been incredibly kind and supportive. some of you think i should have the baby, some of you think its a terrible idea, but all of you are being honest, supportive and kind. ",3
"for trying to contact my husband through the means that are available to me?. my husband never charges his phone.  if i have to reach him during the day, i just can't.  he gives people my phone number if they need to reach him.  sometimes i need to reach him (sick child at school, etc.). sometimes he is home while i am at work.  so i always try his phone first (never charged).  then sometimes i drop in on one of the alexas in the house or the furbo dog camera.  i usually just say, ""hi husband, give me a call when you get a chance.""  today,  i knew our daughter was having friends over and wanted to discuss those plans since he was to be in charge at home.  called the phone, phone is dead.  i figured he was on his computer, so i sent a video message to his computer.  he called me back, and boy was he pissed.  he said he was sick of me spying on him with all of my cameras.  he went on at some length about me spying on him.  i'm not.  i don't give a shit what he does at home.  anyway he was so mean to me on the phone that i cried for about 15 minutes.  then when i got home it continued.  him yelling at me about spying on him.  i'm really not.  i'm just trying to get in touch with him however i can because he refuses to charge his phone.  i'm still upset about him yelling at me, crying on and off all afternoon.  anyway thanks for reading.
edit:  just to be clear, i only contact him if i have to:  e.g., sick child, after school plans, flat tire.  i'm not calling him excessively or spying on him.  i don't need to spy on him.  he sleeps, eats and watches tv.",3
"for thinking the queue starts when you start physically standing in line?. okay so my mom and i have been several times to a certain government office. we like to get there about an hour before it opens so we can get a good a good spot in line (it makes a difference when you get in there, it can take 10 minutes for the first person in line and over an hour if you show up late.)  

so the first time we show up, we get there an hour early and i am the first person standing in line. a couple minutes or so go by and a lady approaches me and says something to the effect of ""just so you know, you weren't here first. other people were in there cars before you got here"". i am a little taken aback and say ""no, the line starts when someone starts standing in front of the building"". i was certain i was in the right and that this was just one odd lady and that nearly everyone would agree with me. 

but then we start to notice a pattern. every time we show up early, there are always at least one or two people with the same argument. its gotten to the point where i purposefully wait to be about 5th in line just to avoid the argument, as its not a hill i want to die on.

so now we are curious though, are we the assholes?

edit: also i forgot, if someone has a physical disability or marks their place in line with a chair or something, we obviously let them go ahead of us.",3
"if i didn't let my niece with autism use my weighted blanket anymore?. 
a couple weeks ago though i saved up for a weighted blanket because i thought it would be a lot easier to deal with and it totally was. now i just use that blanket along with my regular comforter and sheet set. now while i absolutely love it, i don't need it to sleep.

last week i (17) got roped into watching my niece (5) over night because my sister had to work and our mom had plans. my niece has autism which causes her to have tantrums every now and then which is why i don't often watch her, but sometimes i have to because my sister (23) can't always afford or find a sitter, which is why she still lives with our mom. in case its not clear we're actually half sisters and half the time i them the other half i live with my dad and step mom.

so my niece had a really hard time going to sleep. like it was almost midnight and she was all over the place. which is not uncommon, but i was really tired myself and just wanted to go to sleep. so i thought why not try and use the blanket on her because thats kind of what they're made for. well it worked pretty well and calmed her down and she soon fell asleep. i was a little annoyed though that i didn't have my blanket to use anymore. 

the next morning my sister found her with the blanket and we got to talking about them. i told her how well it worked. she didn't really believe me so i let her use another night. my sister was very pleased by the results. so, over throughout the week when my niece had two really bad tantrums my sister asked if she could use the blanket. i said yes because she just looked so exhausted herself.

when she looked into buying one she became reluctant because my niece only likes very specific things my sister doesn't want to get her another one that she may not like since i don't remember which brand i got. she is short on cash so she doesn't want to have to buy multiples because honestly they can get rather expensive. i know mine was over $100 because i wanted to make sure i didn't have to deal with the beads spilling out issues that a lot of the cheaper ones have. i

well, when i went back to my dads the other night i brought my blanket with me. my sister calls me late one night completely frazzled and asks where i left my blanket because niece just wont calm down. when i told her i had it with me at my dads she was upset. not at me, just at the situation she had to deal with.

now i'm supposed to go back to my moms today and i don't really want to bring blanket back over there or at least sneaking it over there and saying i left it at my dad. i'm tired of not getting to use it whenever i want and also i just don't want to share it because something about a sharing blanket all the time feels gross to me.

update: several people have informed me that it is very dangerous for a child to use an adult size weighted blanket, so i guess the whole thing doesn't matter now. i'll just help my sister find a kid sized one.

also sorry about calling the meltdowns she was having tantrums. still learning about correct terminology.

thanks for all the suggestions for places to get blankets guys, but i think everyone already named everyplace that exists. the amount of comments is getting a little insane for me so i'm gonna sign off now. thanks again.",3
"for telling my friend that it's not abuse.. so my friend 25f told me yesterday that she was abused a child. i automatically went to tell her how sorry i was and that if she wanted to tell me about it i'm a listening ear. 

she starts to tell me about her abuse and i kinda thought that everything she was telling me was not abuse. 

so she talked about how her phone was taken off her at 8.00 every night. 
he mom would only buy her thrift store clothing. 
her mum had the naughty chair, it was the chair you sat in for 10 minutes if you where naughty. 
she did not get treats after dinner 

she then went on about how sometimes she was starved, so i asked how long that could last. she told me that she was not allowed to eat food an hour before dinner. and midnight snacks where banned. 

i asked if she bad ever been hit, i also added that she can refuse to answer a question if she does not want to answer. 
she had never been hit and her mum never called her any names or yelled at her, unless she was being naughty. 

i asked if there was anything else and she said no. 

that all seemed pretty normal to me. 

i then said, that's not abuse, all the mums i work with at the church group do the same things. 

she got megga pissed and left and is refusing to speek to me. 

i honestly think i was being an asshole and if she does not want to talk to me after this i'll accept. but hey i wanna see what others think.",3
"for not lifting a finger while my girlfriend clean the house?. before i start i want to mention that i would've totally helped out if she asked but she didn't ask me. and forgive me english is not really my first language.

anyway my girlfriend was cleaning the house today. she started early in the morning and i wasn't awake when she started. today is my day off so i would really like to relax, i slept in today until 11am. i expected to wake up peacefully but not really i heard the vacuum very loudly but i just decided to ignore it. i put some headphones on and that was it. my girlfriend is coming in and out of the room to clean and i notice she is looking annoyed. well she walks in one last time and is all angy with me, and she starts complaining that she's busting her has cleaning the whole house and that i don't have the decency to lift a finger to help her. well i got really mad at that and i told her this is my day off and i simply want to enjoy it but instead i wake up to the vacuum running and now my girlfriend nagging me. i told her she could've asked me if she want help but it's not my response lability. she got even more pissed and then left the house and now my mood is absolutely ruined. i just wanted a nice day off. for not lifting a finger to help her on my day off *even though she didn't ask me???*",3
"for telling my wife i don't want her mother in the delivery room when our 1st child is born?. my wife and i are expecting our first in may.  we've been together 10+ with 7 of them married so naturally we've discussed all things baby, family, etc.  one of the things that has come up before is the day of our little ones arrival.  i've stated in no uncertain terms that i believe the only ones in the delivery room outside of medical professionals should be her and i.  my wife however, has expressed that she'd like her mother to be in the room.  we haven't discussed this in some time and definitely not since finding out we're expecting, but i do anticipate the topic coming around again soon.

i take issue with my mil being there bc while she has been very supportive throughout the process (unsuccessful attempts for years followed by several rounds of ivf) i'm of the opinion that this is one of those bonding moments for us and us alone since we are the ones directly involved in this event.  i'm not saying she shouldn't be at the hospital, or even come in to see her before the procedure begins - i'm fine with all of that.  but when it comes time for the main event so to speak, i feel it's time for her to head to the waiting room.  i want this time alone with my wife to laugh, to cry, to enjoy our child privately before they become a spectacle for everyone else.

i've learned quickly that pregnancy hormones are a very real thing, so i'm not entirely certain what to expect when this conversation happens again.  so i'm wondering if i stick to my guns on this one, or am i better off taking one for the team, sucking it up and letting my mil (in my opinion) ruin the moment.

"for blowing up at my husband's brother for how he declined donating sperm to us?. **i want to make it very clear that this isn't about him saying no, it's about how he declined. if he'd just said no, this wouldn't be a conversation.**

my husband and i have been trying for kids for a while. he, as it turns out, has azoospermia, which is no sperm. we've been taking about donors, and he's only comfortable with it if it comes from his brother. adoption isn't something we could possibly afford right now, and i don't love the idea of a 3rd party getting to call all the shots about us having children. eric has donated before in college and currently has a son with a girlfriend. he's a little smarmy and self important, but not a bad person. so we asked him, and now i have regrets. 

he sent a very detailed email in which he went into excruciating detail of all the reasons he felt we wouldn't be good parents, and what we'd ""need to change"" before he would ""give us"" a child. at the risk of making this post as long as the email itself, there were two main points. 

1. he didn't feel that our income was high enough. he demanded to see financial records. he wanted to see his brother more advanced/settled in a career, and wanted to know my career trajectory as well. both of us have been in the same companies for 5+ years, and don't have dead end jobs. he also wanted us in a house and not an apartment. 

2. he felt that i and his brother needed to get therapy for ""being different"". along this line, he wanted his brother to ""act more normal"". we would also need to convert and follow their family's religion and ""not be a heathen"". 

i was furious when i received this. he could have just said no. that he acted like the sole way for us to have children and like he could control our lives is ridiculous. i don't want to adopt because i don't want to have a third party telling me what my standards are. i'd rather be childless. i called him, screamed at him for the horrifying email, and said i wouldn't want his goods if he was the last person on earth. my husband is urging me to consider his terms, which i'm not interested in. am i in the wrong here?",3
"or rather awta - we told our friend that his gf is no longer invited to hangouts.. we're a group of friends that have known each other since grade school. our friend ""paul"" has been with his gf ""ella"" for 2 years going on 3. we met her after they had been seeing each other for 1 month and have known her since. paul took us aside early on and told us she suffers from severe anxiety and depression.

&#x200b;

our friend group is very close and hang out a least once a week. paul brings ella because she says she cannot be left alone due to her mental health issues. we didn't have any issues with this at first, but after 2+ years we are kind of tired of her for these reasons: if we are doing an activity that day that she doesn't enjoy, she will complain the entire time. she is picky so she has the final say in all restaurant choices. despite being around us for 2+ years, if paul gets up to get a drink or use the bathroom she will follow him. she also rarely speaks to us directly and kind of uses paul as a sock puppet to tell us things. when she does speak to us directly, it's usually to call us out on something. some examples include walking past a homeless man and not giving him money, spending too much money on x when you could have given it to charities instead, etc. mostly moral things.

&#x200b;

we have told paul multiple times that her behavior (mostly the complaining part) is unappreciated. every time he's tried to talk to her about it, he says it causes her to have a panic attack. we love to hang out with paul and paul gets very upset if we choose not to invite him to things because of ella, but we're kind of tired of only doing things ella likes and eating at the same 3 restaurants. so last week we told paul that when invite him to things we are only inviting him. we decided that ella is invited to big events like christmas parties and the occasional hangout, but only when we literally invite her. paul did not take this well. he said we are being cruel to someone with mental health issues and are only going to exasperate her anxiety and depression. he also feels like we are basically asking him to choose her or his friends. 

&#x200b;

side note: we're all in our mid twenties. this isn't about ""bro time"". our friend group has women and men and we don't have any issues with any of our other so's.

"for telling my pregnant wife that there is pretty much not a single circumstance where i would choose saving the baby over saving her?. i made the terrible mistake of watching a medical drama with my pregnant wife. we've been binging house m.d. and of course there's a pregnancy complication episode where a dad is asked to choose between the baby and the mother (the mother was going to die either way it was just a little quicker). my wife said that she'd want me to choose the baby if it came to that. i told her there was no fucking way i would do that, we could have another baby but i could never have another her. she got all mad and questioned my commitment to being a father and i said i'm committed to being a father but i'm more committed to being a husband. this argument went on forever.  i told her that if she was brain dead or was going to die either way i would choose the baby but otherwise it's her she said basically said what she wants over and over and i said i'm not spending another 50 or years without her. this is all because i love her more than anything else in the world. we're still in disagreement over this completely hypothetical situation. before anyone asks: yes it has occurred to me i can just lie because chances are this will never happen but it just feels wrong to lie about it.

"update-for kicking a girl off our airsoft team for not following our rules. update is we had our meeting and i sincerely took feedback from r/into meeting.. i got permission from the moderators to update and i wanted to share what happened. 

here is the original if you didn't see it yesterday:

https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/apiwrd/aita_for_kicking_a_girl_off_my_airsoft_team/


since people had things tonight we agreed to meet over lunch and all but 3 people agreed to show up, even among the people that quit outright. so including me 16. i got to the office where we had it and was so surprised to see madison sitting there. so that made it 17 people. the guy who has been on the team the longest  basically said that in light of what happened sunday, he would do the talking. this really annoyed me but i remembered how much bad feedback i got here and didn't say anything. 

they started off by having madison say her thing. i have to admit she was very rational and but she did start crying which made me really uncomfortable. but basically her point was she just moved her for grad school, she didn't want to do the bar and club scene anymore and she said the loved all of us for never asking her out or making her feel uncomfortable and it was the first time she felt like she ever found a group of people, including her sorority, where people didn't judge her for her looks. i was like sure, whatever you think but come on. anyways she said she was really sorry for not keeping our standards and she was just trying to have fun and she is a girl and doing crazy things with her hair or wearing pink camo is just in her mind set. she asked me if i would please consider if i she could stay on the team. 

i was totally on the spot so i was just started out by saying that i was sorry and i overreacted. but then i said i think it's best if i step down because it was obvious i take it too seriously and if 5 people quit in the spot, obviously it was time for a change. but as long as i was still doing it, i was happy to have her back. 

so that lifted a huge weight in the room. so we got into more business and it turns out that the reason madison had not bought her competition gear is because she was reaching out to various companies using her ""insta-fame"" to get our team sponsored. she said the reason she didn't tell me anything because these deals are very tenuous and she didn't want to let us down if they fell through. so she's still working on the uniform stuff but she did get an incredible deal to become a representative for an ammo company so starting with the tournament in march we will have absolutely free airsoft pellets, which for a team of 20 people who play mostly every weekend is huge. she is starting an airsoft specific instagram and she expects it will take off and she'll get deals for the team. i'm literally blown away by her generosity and i'm sure she'll make some income from it, but she's choosing to share with us after the way i treated her. 

but anyways so we talked about more team business and we decided that we would sort of split the leadership position in that we would have an adminstrator for day to day stuff and that's going to be the guy who started the meeting but everyone was happy with how i managed the team for tournaments so i'll be in charge of all tournament related business and conduct at tournaments.  we also agreed that we would dramatically loosen the uniform requirements for weekend local play and madison (or anyone i guess) could wear her pink camo or do her hair in bright red pony tail puffs as long as she was being safe (no belly shirts) but tournaments we would still have our team unforms.

so that is where we are. team is still together, we get a bunch of free stuff and maybe more on the way. madison is cool but it was the first time a teammate hugged me after a meeting but i guess we have to adjust to hugging and crying at our meetings. it's weird but i guess i can stand to update my world view.

"update - for not throwing away pictures of my ex wife?. it's been a bit over a week since my post here made front page, and it's taken about that much time to finish reading through the responses.  you're answers were overwhelmingly positive (save for a few), and today i finally solidified my position and pulled the trigger. 

first the good - when i returned home, i searched the box that i had hid the pictures and scrapbook to find that they were gone. upon inquiring of their whereabouts, i was directed under a bathroom sink. there i found the remains of the scrapbook, mostly put back together. however, i realized that at least 2 pages were missing. i also noticed that a few pictures in question weren't present. upon questioning, i was directed to a trash can, where i found a couple torn pictures. still, to my dismay, i found that the contents of the ravaged scrapbook were still incomplete. further investigation revealed another stash of torn pictures. finally, i have attained all of the pictures. (shout out to the private messages offering to reconstruct them. a massive thanks to you!)

two more days passed and i demanded that she apologize to my daughter for destroying the scrapbook (which now resides in my daughters room). apology accepted, now comes the hard part. 

i wont bother lying to you all, for i fear you would see through me. i considered trying to work through it. i thought, perhaps her efforts to repair the scrapbook are worthy of forgiveness? 

nay!

seriously guys. i cant thank you enough. if it weren't for your guidance, i would probably continue to expose my daughter to this woman. our relationship has ended, and i am now focused solely on raising my beautiful baby girl and my career.

"if i said no to my own wedding?. long story short, my partner and i decided to have a simple courthouse wedding and just spend a simple day together. nothing set in stone but we had general ideas for activities. everything seemed in order.


my mother seemed fine with it at first and kept telling us that we should do what we want and that she didn't care. after some time passed, she told us the wedding officiant wanted to speak with us.  basically, she planned an entire wedding for us and invited both of our close families (about 20 people). she did plan this with me in mind and kept the whole thing small and simple for a wedding so nothing too outlandish. i get the impression that she did this mostly for her parents/my grandparents. she's also covering all the costs.

if i said no even though she already paid some deposits and invited so many people? i feel like i'm being ungrateful and we should just suck it up and go through the whole thing for family, but at the same time. we wanted this to be a day for us and we feel like we don't have any control over our own wedding. i also feel that i'm being guilted into this. my partner is being painfully supportive. if they wanted it, i would go through with it no questions asked and told them as much. but they're saying it's my decision.",3
"for not giving some of my deceased husbands things to his son?. throwaway for reasons.

8 months ago my husband passed away. he had an adult son from a previous marriage and the two of them weren't very close. i don't think they hated each other or anything like that. honestly, i think the divorce had more to do with it. because of reasons i won't go into here, his ex-wife basically had sole custody of their son and the two of them never had a chance to fix that relationship. 

anyway, my husband held some animosity about the whole affair because he felt like his son sided against him in the divorce. right before he passed he made me promise not to give his relatives any of his possessions (he had a bad relationship with his family and he owned some family heirlooms) and i asked him ""what about \son's name\"" and he paused and he said ""he doesn't get anything either"". honestly, i was shocked, but i was pretty much grieving at this point so i didn't question it. 

well, about a month ago his son reached out to me over email asking if he could have a couple of his father's items. he said he's been regretting that they never repaired their relationship and that he never got to say a proper goodbye. the items he asked about were small things like a gold lighter he remembers (i still have it) and a blue button up shirt (i don't know which one specifically, but i still have all of his old clothes). i responded and told him that unfortunately it would go against his father's wishes to give him anything and he replied very politely ""i'm sorry to hear that. thanks for responding."" and that was it. 

about a week later his mother sends me an email calling me names and a bitch for not giving her son the things he asked for and that i'm basically preventing him from moving on. i didn't respond and i blocked her email and i haven't heard anything since. 

i've been feeling sick ever since this happened. i'm still trying to move on from his passing and i'm not trying to stop him from moving on, i'm just trying to honor my deceased husbands wishes, but i feel like i've done the wrong thing and i don't know how to handle this.

"aita? rescued an abandoned (adolescent kitten) stray at our local spca, the previous owner contacted me on social media when they saw a post of my cat. they want her back, i'm not going to let that happen.. sorry if the title is off and for any mistakes here goes,

i visited the shelter because i was feeling low and cats are awesome so i thought i'd volunteer and maybe get some cat therapy.

so i went down with my bff and bf and we played with kittens and old cats (ps: favourite gala name was granny and she was so moody, i loved it). i saw my now cat zuzu, i didn't go up to her at first because i knew i'd fall in love with her. so my foresight didn't save me and i learnt she had been abandoned since late jan 2019. it was then may, so she had been there for +/-5 months. i spoke with the manager and he said he'd phone the owner and see if they'd get back to him and he told me to wait a week. so i did, i confirmed payment on her shots and snips and waited another 3 days for the owner to contact back. they never did. 

so it's now a about month in an i post a pic of her on social media, the owner is a distant acquaintance, a friend of a friend kind of thing. it's a small town. she sends me a direct message and claimed ownership. i explained the situation as well as the attempts at contact and she called bullshit. she never addressed the abandonment, and bowed when i firmly stated that the cat was now in my care and i would provide her with a lovely home. she hasn't responded yet and i did apologize to her in the messages. it's weird i know where she lives and works, it's one of the nice bars in town. she's a sweet person but,

i just feel bad. i understand cat love. i understand bonds, but how can you leave a kitten in a shelter for +/-5 months? how long is that even in cat time? 

i'm conflicted but feel like i'm doing the right thing. i thought very long about bringing a cat into my home and even got the support of my housemates and close friends. i gathered supplies and made what i couldn't afford. i love that fluffy stinkball, but how do i manage this relationship in a small town? do i ignore it? i just don't know how not to be the asshole here...

edit: 
abandoned as in at a shelter, not on the side of the road. left there after being put into boarding,

the local spca does have a boarding facility but on weekly fee basis. she (zuzu was left there for way over that time) and the owner was contacted before my attempts after filing for adoption.  

thanks guys, i really appreciate that a lot of people get why i feel so bad but also firm on the decision. 

there's some photos of zuzu on my profile for anyone asking as well. thanks! oh and cool silver thanks! cool platinum! thank you!",3
"if i report a guy from the dealership who texted me?. i (23f) recently went to a dealership to get new wipers put on my car. i was there for all of 5 minutes while a guy who worked there (late 20s m) put the wipers on. we had a short, friendly conversation and then i paid and went on my way, thinking nothing of it. 

however, later that evening, i received a text from a number identifying himself as the guy from the dealership. he basically said he had a great time talking to me, and was hoping that we could meet up some time to talk again in the future. 

this made me really uncomfortable because i never gave him my phone number. he must have gotten it from my profile with the dealership. i feel like that's a breech of privacy on his part, and if he wanted to shoot his shot he could've just done it while i was there in person. 

so if i report him? i would have no doubt about it if he had made me uncomfortable during our irl interaction, but we had a pleasant conversation. i don't want to get anybody in trouble, but it just really sits the wrong way with me that he has access to so many peoples information and is willing to use it in that way.",3
"for blocking my mom out of my life for making sexual comments to the guy i'm dating and potentially causing us to break up?. to preface this, i am 20, my boyfriend is 21, and my mother is 53. 

my mother has always been one to seek validation from others. she'll bring up pictures of her female classmates and ask me or my dad or my 24 year old sister how old they look or she'll compare herself to her sister (my aunt) and get my dad to say that my mom is prettier and skinnier than her sister. when pretty actresses are on tv she'll make comments to my dad like ""here's your woman. she's a redhead. you can go ahead and leave me for her"" and such. i'm sure you get the idea. 

i (barely) tolerated her desperation for approval and validation up until sunday when she did something awful. 

i am in college and met a great guy friend early last year when we were taking a few classes together. his dad owns a limousine company in my area for special events (weddings, prom, birthdays etc) but his dad was sick so he allowed my boyfriend, his son, to use the limousine to take us to the airport. my sister is in the military and is coming home for the first time in several months so we wanted to surprise her by picking her up in a limousine since she's always wanted to ride in one but has never gotten the chance to do so.

i asked everyone to please be nice to him because he and i had a few classes together and we are friendly. i didn't mention that he and i have started dating. i didn't want to tell them about us dating because i didn't want anyone making jokes or teasing us about it. he and i are seemingly very compatible and i wanted to get him comfortable with my family if it ever gets serious. we have only been dating around 7 months and date each other exclusively. we are boyfriend and girlfriend.

we (myself, my parents, my 21 year old brother, and boyfriend) leave and everything is fine for a few minutes until my mom starts making awful sex jokes. i can't even remember them all, but i do recall her saying something to him about paying ""another way"" and implied sex and blow jobs. she started talking about how her kneecaps are red (she got them from getting on them and cleaning the house) and she said she was going to do it again tonight for my dad when we got home. even my brother (who is the same age as my boyfriend) and dad were not feeling it after a while. i apologized to my boyfriend and asked my mom to stop. she didn't. if you thought it stopped when we picked my sister up, you'd be wrong.

after we got back home, i refused to get out and asked him to take me to my apartment. i was **so** embarrassed and my boyfriend was visibly uncomfortable. i have since blocked my mom's phone number and got my sister to bring the spare key i had given my parents so they no longer have access to my apartment. my sister comes here to visit with me because i can't stand to be around my mother. i have apologized so much to my boyfriend for my family and he told me that he's sorry, but he isn't sure if the relationship will go further and needs time to think.

"who is the asshole? brother upset i am not taking on childcare duties when we live together.. my brother howard 32m and i 24f are renting a house from our father. originally it was just me and a cousin, but howard moved in when she left. howard and his wife, janis, have two kids. my niece 5f and nephew 2m spend half the week with one parent, and half the week with the other. howard has them from friday to monday morning. 

the current problem—

i have tried to talk to my brother about his expectations of ""help"" and that i find them unreasonable. i am not the second parent in the household, i view us living together as roommates, not really a family unit. i am here until i finish school and can move out on my own. 

he wants to go to the gym or go out with friends, but the times he wants to go are during my only free time. i feel like i shouldn't be asked to give up my free time when babysitters are available for that kind of thing--he is just too cheap to hire one. his argument, that he would do the same for me, is empty. i don't plan to have kids. he has insulted me for not dropping everything to watch his kids, calling me ""selfish"" and ""shallow"" for not helping him out. 

howard says-- 

i have an issue with my sister not helping because we live together and we should, as a family, be willing to help when need be. i feel like she has done very little to help with the kids. 

she makes her own meals, but she doesn't offer to help make meals for the kids. she is not home much, but when she is, she will order something small to the house and not ask if i want anything i will give her $$$. 

when i ask her to help me get the kids ready for something, she tells me no. we have gotten into arguments because she will see i am trying to get the kids ready and she just leaves, without even asking if i am okay. 

i need to get away from the kids sometimes. i have asked her to watch the kids while i get milk from the store. she says she will pick up the milk for me. when i tell her i need a minute alone, she says the offer is ""i get the milk or nothing."" 

i am drowning in debt, i have a failing marriage, my kids are a lot, and my parents live far away. i just need some help and she has refused to be more than a passing stranger in their lives. i am hurt, overwhelmed, and resentful—which i don't want to be. but i feel like she could help more, or even a little bit. 

our dad has a pool in the back. she swims laps every morning. it was 90* here the other day and the kids wanted to swim. i had to take calls and asked if she would watch them for 20 minutes. she said, no she was finishing laps, making breakfast, and going out with friends. so she didn't have time. i would desperately like some help. 

conclusion—

we both think we are right and cannot think of a way to make the other person understand. thanks for the help

"if i told my wife i know what i'm doing when it comes to our baby?. i have a 11 month old baby. super awesome little dude. i also have a 10 year old daughter from a previous marriage. i raised her as a single dad from 18 months to the present. 

i've been very careful to not tell my wife how to do things or how i did them in the past because she's excited to have the  experience of a baby and she's expressed things like ""you've done this before. this is my only chance to have a baby."" (i got the snipsnip shortly after he was born). basically i don't want to dadsplain parenting. 

this has led to things that i personally think are potentially problematic (ie she won't do cry it out even though the doc said it's time) but i'm happy to let her have her way so long as lil dude is healthy and safe. (yes we've talked about it and she knows where i stand on it. that's not what i'm worried about being an asshole about) 

so the other day, i'm putting his shoes on and she tells me, ""be sure they're on the right feet."" or while giving him a bath ""be sure to clean his diaper area well."" 

duuuuuuuuude. i knoooooooooow.


and it's been like that since the beginning. ""you've got to support his head."" "" you swaddle him too tight"" ( i didnt. that shit's supposed to make then immobile).

like i said. i want her to enjoy the ride. but i kept a kid alive for a decade almost entirely by myself. i don't need to be told how to put a pair of shoes on a baby or any other obvious shit. 

would i be the asshole if i told her ""you know i know what i'm doing, right?""",3
"for taking the office microwave?. over a year ago the microwave at my office died. the company refused to replace it. they said we could use money we earned for prizes to go towards that. this would take a long time. 

i wasn't having that. at the time i went out and spent about sixty dollars on a microwave. initially i kept it at my desk, but everyone kept coming to use it. so i moved it to the office kitchen. 

everyone who saw it at my desk is gone. it's just been ""the microwave"". anyway, my wife and i bought a new house recently and it needs a microwave. our new home is close enough to the office that i can commute home during lunch. so i took my microwave home. generally speaking i close the office and i'm the last one here. i took it home when nobody else was here without saying a word. 

a lot of my peers are furious i ""stole"" my own microwave. even the company owner and my manager are upset saying i snuck it out at the end of the day or that if i bought it for the office it should stay here. that was never my intention. i never communicated it , but i always meant to take my microwave home with me. it's not like sixty bucks is a lot of money but it's not an inconsequential amount. i dont see why they can't all chip in a bit and buy one that way. five bucks each or something. i said that and again more angry reactions. 

the screwy thing is my wife is even on their side. saying most people see it as company property and it's been there so long we should let it go and we should buy another one. i'm not willing to budge here. it feels foolish that i should donate my personal property because people expect me to. 

aita?

edit: thanks for the input on this one. i guess i was honestly an asshole here. i didn't intentionally bring it home in a way to actively make my coworkers uncomfortable but i think i was also stuck on the ""mine"" like a toddler. this is a bad situation for everyone. i'll take some time and reflect on bringing it back.

edit 2 : just to clarify my office has a lot of turnover. it was abundantly clear with that initial group of staff that if was my property. but since then it's a lot of new faces. not justifying anything. just providing more context to my actions.

edit 3:
obligatory ""this blew up way more than i expected!""

 a lot of people seem to be asking ""why doesn't your boss provide one"". i work in an insurance agency. we spend little time in office as possible. especially the agents and financial advisors. the owner believes more creature comforts = more reason to stay in the office. she says that's how it was when she came into the business. not a position i exactly agree with. it's nonsense to think a microwave will have a sharp decline in sales. at some level she is entitle to this opinion because she owns the business and she is the largest agent in the area by a very wide margin. not justifying it. just sharing. 

right now i've asked around the office and sort of calmed the waters with most everyone sans 2 or 3 people. most people took the apology in stride. a few are angry for the sake of it. planning on confronting the owner at some point tonight. a few people are willing to split the cost but that's if she isn't willing to cave on the issue. just wanted to add this.

final update : met with my boss. it was a very mixed bag. i read a lot of comments on and off today. i decided to throw some weight around. telling her how much i've earned her what i've done. i basically laid it to the basics that it wasn't fair what she was doing. i told her she created this situation. i told her most people who produce at my level leave in 5 months for other companies. i asked her why i shouldn't go to the place everyone else leaves to. 

she didn't like that. she told me this is exactly why she doesn't like appliances in the office. if it wasn't for clients she'd ditch the coffee machines and fridge too. we sort of went back and forth with this for a while. my boss asked me how would i like it if she went to my home and demanded i bring something in. she disclosed her annual salary. it's very similar to what i make. i called that bluff and asked about business profits. told her she wouldn't run a company like that if she only made some 11k more than me. 

negotiations broke down. at some point during this her assistant who's been with the company since day 1 went down the road and bought a microwave and toaster oven from a consignment shop a few blocks over using the imprest fund. she ended the conversation telling my boss ""quit your damn bickering and do some work so we can go home."" 

i feel bad about dragging my bosses assistant into it. that woman is a saint. but i suppose this is the desired outcome of it all.

edit whatever electric boogaloo: turns out at least one of my colleagues found this since it hit the front page. so that's... fun? but seriously y'all, posting ""quit immediately and now"". that's a bit drastic. i have a lot of gripes. but i plan on sticking with my job for a few years for experience. that's a funny thing you see on reddit a lot people say ""quit right the fuck now"". but like, people have houses/bills/etc. i have a daughter. this is the real world. you have to dance to that fiddle sometimes.",3
"for turning the sprinklers on annoying tourists?. i live in a small town on the coast of nc with my husband and kids. the town is about 300 years old and it has maintained historical buildings and traditions to promote tourism and historical interest. our house is, imo, quite beautiful. google the hamptons white house, it's almost identical to that house.

as it's a historical area there are numerous tours to see the old cemetary, jail, courthouse, various historical homes. blackbeard once graced our town and his ship is actually sunken off the coast.

our house is near the historical district but our neighborhood is new and our house is not part of the history. a couple days ago i let my kids go out and play in the sprinkler in the front yard while i cleaned and after a while i noticed people leaning on my fence with their phones put so i went out to investigate. they said they were walking the historical trail and my house was so pretty they wanted photos.

i pointed out that the historical path is three blocks up and those properties have large plaques denoting their historical value. they said they k ow but my house was just so nice they couldn't resist and they didnt want to pay for the tour. i pointed out my kids were very obviously playing and they were half-dressed in their swim suits and their photos had been taken, and that the house was obviously a private home. i added i wanted the photos deleted as i didnt want my kids photos going off with them when they're in their bathing suits. if we had been out in public it would have been different but this is my home behind a fence. i asked how they would have felt if i followed them home and did what they were doing. they argued with me for a few minutes.

they told me they wouldnt delete the photos and if i wanted privacy i should have built a taller fence. they kept taking photos so i went to go back inside but as i did i stopped and turned on the sprinklers next to the fence. they were soaked.

"for planning a vegan thanksgiving for my meat-eating family?. my family and i (husband and children) are vegan. we have been for years. 

his sister and her family lost their home in a fire, and they're staying with us while they rebuild. my husband and i don't mind if they bring meat or animal products inti our house, but *we* won't cook them. 

therein lies the problem for thanksgiving. we have foods such as mushroom gravy, meatless dressing, etc. i offered to let his wife use the oven or the roaster either if they want turkey, but i'm not willing to put meat in my stuffing or use beef gravy or make other foods non vegan. they're welcome to do so, but i won't. 

my husband backs me, but his sister says we're not being good hosts. she says she *can't* fix her family other options because i'll ""have the kitchen all tied up"" and that ""as hosts, it's our job to make them feel welcome.""

"because i completely lost it with a lady who tried to cut in front of me twice at a large grocery store?. i was at a large grocery store yesterday and i walked up to the butcher area to ask for assistance but there was one person ahead of me. when the person finished, i was just about to ask the butcher my question when a woman cut in front of me and asked him, ""hi, can you please help me in the freezer aisle?"" the butcher said ""yes"" and was about to follow her when i interjected, ""sir, i was here first."" i swear i saw an eye roll on his part but whatever.

moving on. i had a cart full of groceries and i stood in line to check out. there was a woman who was unloading her packed cart in front of me so i waited a few feet behind her because had i moved my cart forward, i would have been blocking the traffic for other customers to walk through. then, i see the same woman, who cut me off in the butcher station, nonchalantly walk in front of me and then she proceeded to unload her items onto the conveyor belt. i told her, ""excuse me, ma'am, i've been waiting here. i'm next in line."" she gave me a smug look and said, ""ha, if you're next, then why are you standing back there and not here??"" so i told her, ""because i don't want to block the flow of traffic walking by but i am next.""

guys, she continued to argue with me saying, ""well....you should've moved forward"" and then continued to unload her groceries. keep in mind that i am not a confrontational person. in my 44 years on this planet, i have never been in a fist fight, in fact, i used to be a major pushover. if i was 18, i may have told her, ""you're right, go ahead."" well, that's not what happened.

i. saw. red. i yelled at her, ""listen lady, i'm a civilized person who takes others into consideration, unlike you who probably doesn't give a shit would've blocked this entire area. now put your things back into your cart now or i'm going to go over there and do it for you!"" then, the kind lady that was originally in front of me, and had finally completed her transaction, took one look at her and said, ""seriously? you need to move because she has been waiting."" you'd think that she would have backed off? nope. she continued to unload her groceries muttering that i should've been closer and not standing so far in the back.

i yelled, ""i'm not going to tell you again. get your shit and put it back into your basket or i'll go and do it myself. now."" she then took a good look at me and started putting her things back in her cart and walked away. i would imagine that by this point, my eyes were crossing and my head was two seconds from spinning like the kid from the exorcist. i can't remember the last time i've felt so angry.

she finally moved but she kept staring me down and i'm ashamed to tell you guys that i screamed ""what the f\*\*k are you looking at????????"" she finally looked away and as quick as this started, it ended. the nice lady that was in front of me patted me on my back and told me that she was impressed how i defended myself but to please calm down because i looked like i was about to pass out.

i need to add that since the store was so packed and music was blaring, not many people witnessed what went down.  only those within hearing range were able to witness this exchange.  i know....  no excuses.

to be honest, at this point in my life, i've let people walk all over me. if this had happened ten years ago, i would've let her go on ahead of me. not now. i'm a jaded, middle aged woman who is not the one. don't get me wrong, what came out of me yesterday felt like an out of body experience. i'm not a mean person. she just sparked something in me that threw me over the edge.

edit: this may or may not be relevant, but i'm a mexican american and all of this occurred in spanish. i am a fluent bilingual speaker but i usually speak english. i didn't even know that i could fight the way i did in spanish. believe me, if you guys knew how to speak spanish, i would've written the exact exchange i had with this entitled twit in spanish. i don't know why but when arguments happen in spanish, it looks like a much bigger deal!! ha!

edit:  i'm getting some flack from some who are calling me an asshole because i assumed that there wasn't a single person here that could speak or read in spanish.  i know a lot of you can so  i translated this story into spanish so it's somewhere within this thread.

"for telling a girl that i'm not attracted to her beacause of her appearance?. yesterday, i (24m) attended a party. there were many of my old friends there. one of the girls, 25?, was someone who i was close to growing up but lost contact with after.

the two of us reconnected and talked. she was drinking a bit, although i didn't. later on, she was doing things like putting her arm around me, holding my hand, etc, which i stopped because i have a girlfriend and i told her so.

then, she asked, ""if you weren't taken, i bet we'd be together right now."" it was a bold thing for her to say and i guess it must have been the alcohol talking. i just responded, ""nah don't think so."" she was offended and asked me why. i just said ""you're not my type"". she asked me why she wasn't my type, and i was tired of her bugging me, so i said, ""you're just not what i'm attracted to.""

she got mad at me. she said, ""oh i get it, you're attracted to coked up skeletons like your girlfriend."" referring to the fact that my girlfriend is tall and skinny. i got defensive and said, ""well im not attracted to fat basic bitches like you."" granted, she's not even fat, just thick/chunky. but she does overdo the spray tan and she looks like every basic girl ever. i guess a lot of guys are after that look but not me.

"for not apologizing for sleeping with a woman's husband accidentally?. in june, i met a guy we'll call chris on tinder. we met up for dinner and had a great time and got to know each other. he told me he was recently divorced, and divulged that the reason was that his wife wanted kids and he didn't. this was great because i mention being childfree in my profile (i'm 31 so this comes up a lot).

we met up again and ended up seeing each other a couple of times a week and sleeping together for a little over a month, before he showed up in my facebook 'people you may know' and he was very clearly married with a kid and wife. i confronted chris (and of course ended things) and he begged me not to tell his wife before he could, because she's pregnant and he wants to be the one to tell her. i said i'd give him a week.

within the week, his wife messaged me on facebook and said he told her what happened, and i gave her the full story. i told her i was sorry he'd betrayed her like this and fooled me, and that i of course never would have started dating a married man. as we were winding down the conversation, she then told me she wanted me to apologize for sleeping with her husband and that she needed that for closure.

for me, this was a record scratch moment. i did nothing wrong here. i had no idea this man was married, let alone had a kid and one on the way. when i found out i confronted him immedaitely, broke up with him immediately, and forced his hand in telling his wife. there is nothing on my conscience here. i was lied to, too. i am not going to apologize because i feel like it's disrespectful to me to try to make me accept blame.

for not being willing to apologize? i don't know this woman, and her feelings here don't have more value than mine do to me. i don't want to debase myself with the kind of apology she wants, and she's furious and spamming me with messages because i'm 'unrepentant.'",3

https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cges5o/wibta_if_i_take_my_coworker_to_hr_for_touching_my/
 
 

i went to hr and asked them for advice to deal with the situation. honestly, she wasn't very helpful and said i should just keep working as usual/try to ignore him. i think they went and talked to him though, because immediately after my meeting he started avoiding me.
 
 

this was until two weeks ago, when i gave my notice.
 

 
they decided that louis should be my replacement, despite having absolutely no experience in my department. which means i've spent the past two weeks training him.
 
 

honestly, there's no other way to describe the experience except as ""hell on earth"".
 
 

there's too much creepiness to even write about; he's engaged in full creep mode this whole time. making all sorts of inappropriate comments. touching me whenever gets the chance and literally sitting an inch away from me. and he doesn't take notes or anything about how to do the job. he just stares at me and tries to make conversation.
 
 

you remember the office when toby touches pam's knee? that happened the other day. when we were sitting at my desk and i was training him. he straight up touched my knee and held his hand on it as he was telling me how proud he was of me. it made me so uncomfortable i got up and walked away.
 
 

i tried talking to hr about it. since i gave my notice, they've no interest in dealing with it.

my company gives out our yearly bonus at the beginning of september. they said they would still give it to me if i agreed to stay and train.

"for using the money i won in a lottery to finance my own dream vacation across europe/asia besides on my kid's student loan debt?. on my birthday this year, i treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. after taxes, i had ~$34,000, so i've put $7,500 into my wife's car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. i'm planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, i plan to travel for the month of january and half of february across asia and europe. i've never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to disney world for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.

well yesterday my daughter emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. i told her about how i'm financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and emily went quiet before saying ""instead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt"".

i told her that i'd be happy to co-sign loans for her, but i was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount i promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). she said even after paying that off, she's looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. 

i told her that really sucks, but reminded her that i offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn't want to ""miss out on the prestige"" (she got into dartmouth). i talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.

she's brought up how the 10k i gave jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. she argued how it's not fair that i was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.

i told her that he'd be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. ultimately, the line i drew was that both children get equal amounts and i can choose how i want to spend my money, end of discussion.

i thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife amy about it behind my back. amy tried to ""persuade"" me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months i had planned. i told her the same thing that i told our daughter, and then she then got mad and said that i'm being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount i put into *her* car and the fact that she used all of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). i told her this vacation was non-negotiable.

now i have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. i feel like they're both acting entitled to my shit; am i really being unreasonable here?

"if i followed through on my ultimatum of not coming to thanksgiving because of my sister's awful boyfriend?. my younger sister (30f) has been dating ""jerry"" for 3 years. he's a loud-mouth who holds ignorant, bigoted, and homophobic views. i have no clue what my sister sees in him as no one in my family shares his perceptions. here's what the first thanksgiving was like with him (he was meeting my family for the first time). he brought up the recent election and called me a ""snowflake"" because he knew i didn't vote for trump ( i guess my sister told him since i didn't know him before this.) he went on about how awesome trump was and how awesome this country is now going to be. i didn't engage because i thought he was  foolish, how he had no idea who my parents voted for and still thought it was appropriate to run his mouth nonstop at the dinner table the first time meeting all of us. after more than two hours of this, my mother finally asked him to change the subject. 

fast forward to now. he has, on more than one occasion, brought up that if his kids ""ever decide they are \insert vulgar word for gay here that begins with an f\"" that he'll disown them, and other awful things along the same lines. i'm the only one that pushes back, usually asking him why he'd say that, which usually fires him up even more. there's no having a respectful conversation with him. my sister just jokes and laugh it off every time he says something blatantly racist or ignorant. my parents cringe and try to change the subject. 

the final straw came when he went on social media and made comments about my relationship. he tried to call out my boyfriend and me because we both have good careers and split household expenses. he thinks this is wrong because ""you're in a relationship, you shouldn't be nickel and diming each other like you're just roommates, what's wrong with you two? doesn't he take care of you?"" which is hilarious because he's in his 30's, he moved in with my sister who pays for everything after two weeks of dating, only works part-time by choice and has no savings whatsoever. 

i blocked him and called my mother. i vented to her that i don't appreciate any of misogynistic/bigoted/homophobic views and he's a loser. my mom agreed with me but said she wishes we could all get along. my boyfriend and i live a plane ride away and i told her i wouldn't be coming to thanksgiving this year if he was. i said because they, meaning my parents and sister, just sit there while he talks, that that makes them complicit to the hateful commentary and i don't want to be associated with someone like him. my mom was understandably upset and said i was her priority since she never gets to see me, but that she couldn't tell my sister not to bring him. my dad is sick about this and wants everyone to shut up and get along. i feel i have reached my limit, but some of my extended family members feel like i should just suck it up since it would really crush my parents since i live far away if i didn't see them on a holiday.

"for telling my friend that if she kept up her ""no filter"" persona, we'd stop inviting her to hang out?. my friend, we'll call her bridget, is one of those ""not like other girls"" people. she makes those posts on facebook, talks about it, etc. it can get a bit annoying, but the biggest issue i have with it, is that she ""has no filter"". now, i'm all for speaking your mind because free speech and all of that. but there are times when you need to have a filter. she's the type to point out when things are awkward between two people, but they're pretending to be civil for the sake of the group and just get through this outing, before they don't have to see each other again. doesn't happen often, but it's happened a couple of times when people have had an argument or don't like each other and then things are even more awkward.

if someone is on their phone a bit, she'll wave her hand in front of their face and say ""hey there"" and then call them on it. if they have a fashion sense that's odd to her, she'll make fun of them, even if they ask her to stop. she'll also tell you really random, graphic stories about her past, the same ones over and over. it's sad the first time, but your cocktail anecdote should not be ""my house burned down when i was 11 and my uncles died two days apart, plus i think they haunt me."" (the uncles didn't die related to the fire, they died of terrible diseases and these are tragic stories, and i'm sorry they happened, btw, i'm not trying to make light of it.) it makes people feel awkward, which you guess it…she calls them on and laughs about.

if you call her out on any of this, ""i have no filter"". a lot of our friends don't like this, but a bulk of them (including myself for a bit until she did this with me for way to long about the clothes) chalk it up to ""that's just bridget"".

the other night, we were all hanging out and one of the guys had brought his new girlfriend. we were all talking about fairly, light, funny topics. suddenly, bridget brings up her uncles and started talking about their sickness, in excruciating detail. i can tell that the new girlfriend was getting pretty weirded out and i told her ""hey, maybe we can talk about the time they took you fishing. that's a funny one."" 

but no, she continued until she was done. then the room got quiet, as it always does after she tells this horrible, awful story about two men dying of cancer and she looks around, bursts into laughter and goes ""well, now none of you have anything to say.""

our friend's new girl looks humiliated and i just feel so bad for her. i say, ""bridget, you need to cut this out. if you keep this up, people are going to stop inviting you to hang out with us. no one likes the way you talk to them. we've told you in the past."" she looked incredibly hurt and i said ""sorry, i don't have a filter.""

b and i took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. she paid me for these photos and signed the rights to me. eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. 

however she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and i had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. leaving me with almost too much to pay.

she left and i continue paying as i did not want to get kicked out. after the year long lease ends, i move elsewhere.

two years later b messages me out of the blue, demanding i delete all the photos i took of her. normally i would but not after how she did me. so i told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. 


she then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  i already gave them to the local law enforcement). 

i told her that i would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, i will post the texts online and i dug up the facebook messages she sent telling me that i could do whatever i wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew i owned the rights. 

i basically say it since she was acting like that, i would give her an ultimatum. if she really wanted the photos gone, i wanted every cent she told me in rent. and i said that if she accused me of being abusive, i would post her messages and sue her for slander.

never heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from b. true to my word i deleted the photos in front of her and she told b. 

this story is so bizarre that i'm pretty sure i fucked up one way or another. so i figured i would share it here.",3
"for ""being triggered"" by my boyfriend setting rules for my pregnancy weight gain?. hello, long time follower, first time poster. so my boyfriend knows that i have a lot of body image issues. i am a little overweight, and i struggle with it. i've tried a myriad of different diet plans and exercise routines over the years, but nothing seems to stick. my boyfriend and i both really want to have a big family, and i've confided in him before that i can't wait to have a baby, but the thought of being pregnant gives me a lot of anxiety because i don't want to gain weight.

so last night he calls me out of the blue, and says he just wanted to say ""i love you so much, and i can't wait to marry you and have babies with you because you'll make such a wonderful mother..."" and my heart is so full hearing this, and then he goes ""...but i can't have you go and ballooning up each pregnancy. you'll be 300 pounds by the time we're done having kids, and i'm not having sex with no big fat slob"" and when i pushed back, he doubled down and set me guidelines of how much weight i am allowed to gain each pregnancy, and that after birth, i'll get one month to ""relax"", then two months to get back to my pre-baby weight, and then i'll get pregnant again, and repeat.  

so we fought about it. i said he was being insensitive, and treating me like a sex-and-baby machine and not a human being. he tried to say he was only worried about my health (his dad died when he was a child from diabetes) and i was okay with that argument, but in trying to explain his health concerns, he kept digressing into such gems as: 
i'm not gonna stay married to you if i don't get hard looking at you
do you want our kids to be embarrassed by you? do you want them to say ""daddy, can you drop us off as school instead of mommy, because the other kids make fun of the way mommy waddles?
i love you, but my love is conditional, and the condition is not gaining more than 30 pounds. when the scale hits 31, i'm signing the divorce papers.
if you told me not to weigh 300 lbs, i'd say ""sure thing, babe, you're right"" but the fact that you won't agree to it means that you must actually want to weigh 300 lbs, so if that's your goal, good luck but we're breaking up if that's what you want
do you want our kids to be fat fucks too? you want to give them insulin shots in kindergarten because you and the babies sit on the couch all day feeding each other ding dongs? 

we've had a lot of fights in the past around my boyfriend being blunt by nature, and me being overly sensitive by nature, but i really think he was out of line. and the whole conversation came out of nowhere, which really makes me feel like my weight is something that was just eating away at him and he had to get it off his chest. but should i just let it go if he insists he's only worried about my health? with his family history, it's understandable that he'd worry about obesity and have a bit of a complex around it, and he is insisting that he's not asking for too much so i should just agree to it since gaining minimal weight is also what i want, so i shouldn't fight him and we just be in agreement?

"update: for refusing to invite my fiance's ex, who he is still friends with, to our wedding?. original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c2wnn4/aita\_for\_refusing\_to\_invite\_my\_fianc%c3%a9s\_ex\_who\_he/(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c2wnn4/aita_for_refusing_to_invite_my_fianc%c3%a9s_ex_who_he/) 

so it's been over a month since i first posted and i thought that i'd post a last update for you guys as part of closing this chapter of my life. 

short story: my fiance and i have broken up. during pre marriage counseling he realized that he still loves his ex. she also broke off her own engagement for him. they are now back together.

i took to heart three things from the replies in my original thread. those who said i was yta told me not to look at my fiance's ex as his ex but as his friend. those who said i was nta adviced that i should talk to my fiance about my insecurities. some suggested pre marriage counseling. so i swallowed my pride and told my then fiance that his ex is welcome in our wedding because she is his friend. i also told him of my insecurities and asked if we could go to pre marriage counseling. he was supportive and agreed. 

after our second meeting with our counselor, my ex fiance talked to me. he said that counseling has made him realize that he is still in love with his ex. i was in total shock because he has always been the perfect boyfriend, i never felt like i was competing with anyone for him. he said he never meant to hurt me and that he did love me, but he could not marry me knowing that part of him will always belong to someone else. 

it's been a few weeks since we broke up and surprisingly i have been holding up well. it hurts because i miss him but i just tell myself that he's not the right one for me. i'm 23, i have my whole life ahead of me and it's an exciting new adventure to try to find the right person. 

my ex fiance and i are civil. he is a good guy and i appreciate our time together, though it sucks that it has ended. from what i know he told his ex that he still loves her and i guess she felt the same way because she also broke off her engagement to give their relationship another try. good luck to them.

so there, i just want to thank everyone who commented whether it's yta nta or nah. i had great advice from people especially those who said we should try pre marriage counseling. it changed my life. hopefully for the better.",3
"for wanting to send my teen daughter to a weight loss camp?. my daughter (15) is 5'6 and the last time she weighed herself at the doctor's office she was at 238lbs. she is morbidly obese.

she was always a chubby kid who loved food and hated activity no matter how much her dad and i tried to get her to dance, play sports, go on walks with our dog etc. she would refuse. i regret not taking her to a nutritionist earlier, but i thought that she would go into puberty and her weight would eventually be okay. unfortunately, when she was 11 her dad and i decided to get a divorce. no special reason, it just wasn't working. we coparent well, we're friendly, we go on trips with out daughter etc., but the divorce impacted her negatively at first. 

she started gaining a lot of weight around that time so we decided to take her to a nutritionist who recommended therapy for her. she initially lost about 15lbs but she was already very dependent on food. now, she's a food addict. her emotional eating was something she used to cope with the divorce until she adjusted, but now it's all about compensating for not having friends, compensating for not being ''pretty'', compensating for not being liked by boys etc. 

she still goes to therapy regularly, she doesn't suffer from depression or another health condition that might cause her weight gain, she is simply addicted to food and at her vulnerable age, mentioning her weight to her makes her very upset and uncomfortable. her dad and i both know this and it's been causing arguments between us. i'm a very active, fit person and i try to lead by example - no junk food allowed in the house, i cook as much as i can or i get healthy meal delivery - and this makes me the bad guy.

she's into the whole body acceptance movement and she sold the story to her dad who now allows her to raid his pantry and they eat junk together just so he wouldn't upset her because she's daddy's little girl. he's happy that he gets to be the good guy and i'm the villain who doesn't want her daughter to settle because i want her to live past 35. i encourage her to love herself, i want her to embrace how amazing she is but i don't want her to accept her condition as something normal that can't be changed. i'm tired seeing how miserable she is because of her weight and i'm tired of thinking about all the diseases that could kill her. 

i found a great weight management treatment facility (*edited instead of camp because it's very different from the infamous fat camps) for teens that's 6 hours away, i've done my research but her dad doesn't want to sign for her to go there from january to july. we can visit her and she can come home once a month, she can go to school there, make friends and get healthy. he says that i'm being a selfish asshole and that our daughter doesn't want to go. she told me that she will think about it but i think that her dad is loving his role as her superhero because they've bonded in the past months, and will encourage her not to go.

aita?

__edit:__ lots of repetitive question and comments. please look through my comment history, thank you.

__edit2:__ again, i've explained everything about this treatment facility, her current therapy and approach to her eating disorder, the fact that the choice is ultimately hers, yes we do have a dog and no she doesn't want to walk him, no this isn't a quick fix, no i don't think my daughter hates me.

__edit3:__ i sound like a broken record, put please read through my comments before asking the same things over and over! there's a word limit here and obviously not everything fits in the post. the facility does have therapists, specialists, doctors and all types of health professionals. they do have ed programs that she would be a part of and she would be in touch with her current therapist because she has a hard time opening up to new people, so that would help her. i double and triple checked everything and talked to so many parents and employees, but it's ultimately her choice. my fear is that her dad will cloud her judgment by bribing her with food.

__edit4:__ thank you guys for all of your responses. i've received a lot of great advice, your own experience with ed, personal stories, support and empathy. i appreciate all of it. i'll no longer be replying to comments because i find myself trying too hard to reach people who are twisting my words and using them against me. maybe i'll post an update within the next few weeks when something happens, but things definitely will change around here. again, thank you all!",3
"for telling my son about my ex wife's infidelity?. ex and i divorced 8 years ago.  we have two kids together. my son in 16, turning 17 very soon.  

my ex wife has always publicly said that the break up was mutual.  lately however i found out she had been telling both my kids that i left her and didn't give her the chance to continue the relationship. 

my son was upset with me about it.  my daughter couldn't care less as far as i could tell. 

so i took my son alone and told him that his mother had always been lying to him. that she cheated on me and that was what ended our relationship.  

i haven't even heard from the ex yet and i'm already feeling like i did something wrong.   all i did was tell him the truth.  and only in response to her lies. ",3
"for telling my girlfriend that her six y/o stinks and needs to be taught proper hygiene?. first time poster here and i'm on mobile so i hope this goes well. anyways, let's jump right in to the stank!

me (24m) and my girlfriend (24f) had a baby boy one month ago today, and things have been pretty awesome. we've really come together as a couple and our communication has been healthier than ever; even our levels of trust and little displays of affection are through the roof. all in all, a potentially stressful and chaotic situation worked out pretty well! 

my so has a six year old boy from a high school fling. the father moved several states away when he found out about the kid, and has only been around two or three times, for no more than an hour each time. her son knows i am not his father but for the last three years i have tried to reinforce the fact that i am his friend and he can always talk to me. we play basketball together and we go bowling every weekend, as long as he behaves in school that week, so i would think to think that we are pretty close. 

so two days ago (friday) after work, the three of us went bowling while my mother watched our newborn. as we're changing shoes, i notice a really gnarly odor akin to sour milk and garlic. i searched for the offensive smell and i realized it was my gf's son's feet. when i leaned down to put all of our shoes underneath the table, i was about a foot away from him and couldn't help but notice he absolutely reeked. i was a little boy once, so i shrugged it off and made a mental note to tell his mom later. 

as luck would have it, she brought up to me a few minutes later how he got made fun of at school that day for smelling bad and how it hurt his feelings. me being the idiot that i am immediately responded with, ""so, it smells like he hasn't wiped his ass properly in days. does he use soap in the shower? did you ever show him how?"" to which she blushed and vehemently responded that it was not appropriate for her to bathe with her own son. 

now that he's six, i kind of agree, but i wasn't born knowing how to properly clean my body, i had to be taught. i told her that i felt as if it was her job as the sole parent to teach her son hygiene, otherwise this problem will never go away. i also stated that with our son, the newborn, i would 100% be taking responsibility for his hygiene so that i knew it would get done. she started to tear up and got really angry with me, so we finished our first game of bowling and left. she's been pissed at me all weekend. here? should i have handled that better? different?",3
"if i asked my neighbour to stop ""borrowing"" my dog to distract her autistic son?. i've had this dog since i was a kid and he's getting on in years now, but he's still pretty spritely for his age. i play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.

i have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. she also has a 12yo autistic son (alex). he's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. so one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and i got text saying, ""hi! hope it's okay but i sent alex to walk your dog."" i said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and i figured that was the end of it.

nope. alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so i'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and i'll panic), and then the neighbour will also ""borrow"" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract alex. i really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since i'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.

i've just got a few issues with some of it. one, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and i like having him close by. i have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. now, i get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and i miss out on bonding with him outdoors.

two -- and i'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. he used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. i vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, ""oh he'll climb right onto alex's lap on the couch."" 

i complained about it to a friend last night and she said i was being selfish, since i don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). and now i feel bad, because i can see how much alex loves my dog, and i don't really want to be a dick just because i'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.",3
"for refusing to meet my dad's new gf, but agreeing to meet my mom's new bf? (age gap weirdness). i am 23/f. my parents \both 47\ divorced 18 years ago. in those 18 years my dad has had a steady flow of *young* girlfriends and fiances moving in with him. i never even got to spend the night with him when i was a kid because there was always some girl living there and there wasn't room for me in his small apartment.

on the polar end of the spectrum is my mom. i do not think she has even been on a date since the divorce, until a few months ago. her whole life revolved around providing for and entertaining me. a few months ago (4ish?) she told me she was seeing somebody named ""scott"" and that it was kind of serious. i have *never* seen my mom look giddy before – it warmed my heart. she then tells me that he is 68 (her dad's age), and to not freak out, but that if i was weirded out, she would call it off. i assured her that while i think it's kind of weird that he is 2 decades older, that i am ecstatic for her. (i am! this woman deserves it.) she cried happy tears, and we agreed that i would meet him soon. 

well, around the same time my mom started dating scott, my dad got a new gf named ""haley."" she has already moved in with him, and i have been refusing to meet her. the reason *why* i don't want to meet her is what makes me an asshole... it's because of her age! she is one year **younger** than me. he is 47, and she is 22. i'm completely grossed out. honestly, it makes me feel like my dad is a huge creep. 

my dad keeps pointing out how i'm a hypocrite because i'll meet my mom's ""creepy boyfriend,"" but not *his* girlfriend. and he will say, ""if you think i'm creepy for dating somebody 20 years younger than me, then why are you okay with scott doing it??"" he made me feel kind of shitty.

i mean, he is right… the age gap is almost the same… but his girlfriend is younger than me. she is 22. scott might be old enough to be my mom's dad… but my mom is almost 50, she's not still in college. and my mom is *far* from naïve. dad's relationship just seems so much ickier to me!! honestly, i'm starting to look back on my dad's relationship patterns and wonder if he's not like a predator or something. but if he is, then is scott too??

i am 100% going to meet scott, and unless y'all convince me otherwise, i am not going to meet haley. (it's nothing against her)

so reddit, aita?",3
"for taking a shot at my professor?. i've never done anything to my professor ever. in a 8 week course i've never missed a class once, and we meet multiple times a week. 

anyway i'm married and have a young son who has a medical issue. 

basically let me explain the backstory first. i do not have a good relationship with this professor in general and don't care for her. she doesn't answer emails, answers a question with a question, isn't helpful or understanding, hypocritical (you'll see why in a minute). 

i informed her a week ahead of time that i wouldn't be attending class one day because no one is able to watch my son literally. usually my sister watches him or his grandparents. my sister had a doctors appointment that she can't reschedule so she can't. 

i don't trust him with not known to family babysitters, atleast not yet and would have to get used to it. 

basically, i don't like this professor. there is supplementary material that she was supposed to upload to blackboard and hasnt done it for weeks and has broken her promise to me multiple times. 

anyway, i was talking about missing class because i would assume their would be a quiz. i could get the notes from someone but can't do the quiz in class obviously. 

she said too bad basically, and when i get in the real world i'll have to be more professional. i tried to explain the situation, but to no avail. she said i couldn't bring my son (ok). i said i would take it in the testing center a few hours later and she said no, no, no. i have to learn how to be professional. 

so i didn't really care, class is about to end since the course is accelerated. i said ""yeah, i'm sure you know a ton about being a professional. taking weeks to grade assignments, not answering emails, breaking promises and going back on your word consistently, you're the last person i'd want to get advice on being a professional from""

my husband said to be careful, she could be spiteful and mess with like my grade. i mean, why is she giving me a lecture about being a professional when she's demonstrated she's the furthest thing from one herself?",3
"if i fired our sitter over religion?. background: my husband and i are both agnostic. our child is 2 years old. we've agreed to introduce to her the cultural and historical aspects of major religions when fit (e.g. when we walk past a mosque and she gets curious. not telling her anything complicated as of now because, you know, she's 2) and save the doctrines for when she's older. our babysitter, i'll call her ""emily"" here, has the patience of a saint, is very helpful and... religious. 

when emily mentioned her religion during our interview, i made it crystal clear that we will respect that, but i also expect her to respect our wishes regarding religions. i gave her some guidelines like no doctrine-embedded stories (e.g. we're all damned because our ancestors decided to eat an apple), no teaching of doctrines etc. emily understandingly obliged, or so we thought.

one day i came home early and caught her telling my child the story of creation of the world. i explained to emily in private that it contradicts what we've been telling her, you know, dinosaurs and such, and reminded her of our agreement. she apologized. i dropped it at that. yesterday i found out she's been reading to my child religious books for kids that basically tell their readers  to pray to and obey some deity. not cool. 

now i want to fire emily because of the religious teaching behind my back, but my husband disagrees. he thinks what's important here is that emily takes good care of our child, and considering that she spends at most 20 hours a week with her, it shouldn't be too hard for us to ""undo"" the religion part. i told him that a friend's child came home calling their parents sinners after two sunday school classes so 20 hours a week isn't as trivial as he thinks. he says i'm overreacting and would look really bad if i fire emily over this issue. plus, our child has bonded with her already, so replacing her would do our child a disservice. i want to respect my husband's opinions but i'm starting to resent emily. so reddit, would i be the asshole if i fire her?",3
"for telling my wife that i can't make the same custom made jewellery which i made for my daughter when she was alive, for another girl who survived the same illness?. i know this might be a very trivial issue for some people, but please hear me out. also, i'm french, so my english is average at best.

we lost our 14 yo daughter to cancer( i don't want to discuss that here ) a couple of years ago. these two years have been very difficult for us. though i've learned to cope up, nothing can ever replace her. 

my wife attended a support group, where she ended up befriending another woman, whose 11yo daughter had the same cancer our daughter had and they became close friends. her daughter survived. we are really happy for her. she and her daughter visit us sometimes. 

last time, when her daughter was here, she came across my daughter's custom made neclace which i made for her( i'm a jewellery designer by profession ). she saw it in a small room in which we made a small memorial for our daughter. it has her pictures, belongings and all her favourite things. she really liked it and asked my wife about it. 

now, after they left, my wife asked me if i can make the same one for the girl. my wife told me that the girl really liked the neclace and asked if she could have one. i told her that it was something i made for my daughter and i don't want to share that or make it for anyone. no one can replace her. my wife thinks that our daughter would be really happy if we shared her memory with someone who had similar struggles and that i'm being selfish. here?",3
"for telling my 8 year old he can't go trick or treating with his sisters. i have 3 kids, a 10 year old daughter, a 8 year old son and an almost 7 year old daughter. my son is on the autism spectrum, but is very high functioning. lately he's been very mean, mostly to his younger sister. it's been going on for a few months, and we've talked about it with his therapist, discussed it alone with him, giving him a lot of 1 on 1 time, we've tried everything thinking maybe it's because he's jealous of no longer being the baby. this morning i heard my 7 year old crying bloody murder and when i went upstairs to her bedroom i see my son with scissors and my daughters costume that we made together as a project was all cut up to pieces. 

i comforted my daughter, made him apologize and brought him downstairs. my husband and i asked him why he would do that and he said ""it was ugly and i didn't like it."" i told him that was the meanest thing he's done, and that he's grounded and can't go trick or treating. he completely freaked out, had a tantrum, kicked and screamed and we just put a pillow under his head until he stopped and got our other kids ready for school. 

while we were getting the girls ready, i guess he called my mother and told her that we weren't letting him go trick or treating and she called me yelling about how could i do that to our child and he has autism and he didn't know what he was doing. 

my husband thinks maybe we also over reacted and we should let him earn the chance to go trick or treating but he completely destroyed his sisters costume and that's not something we can brush off. 


for not budging?


edit: my husband and i have decided he will not be trick or treating. he has shown no remorse throughout the day. we are going to discuss this with his therapist when we see her later today, but this malicious behavior is not going to be tolerated and i will not coddle my son to be a shitty person and man. thank you all for your responses.",3
"for blaming my 14yo sister's pregnancy on my parents?.   

i am a teenage girl living in italy with extremely religious parents, and a now 26 week pregnant 14 year old sister.

my parents raised us with no knowledge of sex, and did everything they could to ensure that we couldn't learn about sex in school (such as removing us from school in days sex education was performed, and going as far as to remove me from class whenever i had biology in my later school years in case i got any ideas), and they never told us about it either. we were always taught that sex is for married couples who want to have children, and so the only real knowledge of sex i had was from my friends and media.

my parents think i am still a virgin despite being with my current boyfriend for two years, but this is not true. as they never found out about me having sex, i suppose my parents assumed their methods worked. however, last year, my sister (who is much braver than i was) came home to my parents and said she had a boyfriend. they got extremely angry, but knowing they couldn't really stop her seeing him without pulling her out of that school, accepted it somewhat.

my sister's boyfriend does not come from a religious background. i know his family well as i am friends with his older sister and they are very liberal.

my little sister and i share a room, and long story short, i found condoms in her pocket when i was tidying her clothes up. i asked her about it, and she told me they had been having sex for months with the condoms. i'm still pretty uneducated on sex due to my upbringing, but i have also been using condoms only for years so i - perhaps stupidly - assumed she would be fine and decided not to tell my parents. she is of age here and he is a nice boy, so i assumed it was fine.

this was a while ago, and i recently came home to a huge argument going on in my house. my parents had found out that my little sister is pregnant, and she has somehow been hiding it for all this time. my parents were going crazy at her, making her cry and simultaneously telling her she is stupid for getting pregnant but also that giving away the baby be wrong. my mother also claimed that an abortion would never be an option, to which my sister said she was too far along anyway. as far as i am aware, abortions are not permitted after the first trimester. at this point, my mother changed her mind and decided that my sister absolutely should have had an abortion. it was a huge mess in which i mainly stood aside. my mother eventually asked my opinion, and i replied:

""i think it's entirely your fault she is pregnant, you actively prevented her from knowing how to have safe sex and ultimately this child should be your responsibility, you have failed her and are abusing her for it.""

my whole family are now angry at me, and along with this i shared that i had sex at her age and the way they raised us made us deceitful. now everyone is angry at each other apart from me and my sister, and i can't help feeling like my input made it worse.",3
"for playing loud annoying music specifically when my roommate was having sex?. she and her boyfriend are really loud. if this was during a reasonable hour then i'd be better with it but this is literally midnight to 3am (not for all 3 hours but starts any time in this window). this keeps me awake when i have to work morning shifts and get to work for 5am most days, so i really need to be able to sleep through the night, which she knows, and even with earplugs they still managed to wake me.

i tried wearing earplugs, then headphones, neither worked, so i've asked them to keep it down more than once. last night they were being exceptionally loud and when i asked them to keep it down, she insisted that i couldn't hear anything. i took out my phone and bluetooth speaker, put the speaker in a bookshelf that is up against our shared wall, and played whatever songs i could think of to ruin the mood.

the songs included, but were not limited to:

* *i just had sex* and *finest girl* by lonely island
* *bananaphone*
* *we should definitely not have sex right now* from crazy ex girlfriend
* *always look on the bright side of life*

and a few others.

about half an hour went by and she leaves her room and pounds on my door telling me to keep it down. the walls are paper thin so she can hear the music the same way i can hear the moaning. today at breakfast she said ""we'll keep it down from now on, you don't have to be such a dick about it.""

i thought we'd be able to laugh it off because they were jokey songs that i picked, clearly for a laugh, and i figured she'd see the funny side but then she said the thing about me not having to be a dick about it and now i feel like a dick.

am i the asshole?

edit: please stop suggesting i record audio of them going at it. it's weird, she's my friend, and it's just really a step too far.

info: they've been doing this for maybe 10 weeks, give or take? i've asked her to stop at least once, sometimes twice, per week since he started coming over, so roughly a dozen requests to keep it down over nearly 3 months.

further info: no one else can hear us. there's no flat above us, no one in the flat below us, the side of us with the bedrooms side has no flat next to it and the nearest neighbours are on our other side with about 30ft and 4 walls between them and us.",3
"for cutting off close friends that ruined my birthday.. let's start by saying i don't have a lot of friends. i organized a birthday dinner and invited my best friend and her girlfriend (who is also a close friend). i asked them weeks before the date and then confirmed a few days before hand both times they said they were definitely coming. keep in mind it was my best friends birthday a few weeks before mine, and i made sure i attended a gaming night she hosted in celebration, and bought her a thoughtful gift. 

i made a reservation at my favorite restaurant, arrived 15 minutes early on the night to make sure i was there when they arrived. half an hour passed and i thought it was strange they weren't there/i hadn't heard from them. they were both active on facebook so i messaged them asking when they were coming. they both read my messages and did not respond. i sat at my favorite restaurant eating my favorite food alone on my birthday. i did not hear from them at all regarding the dinner (not to mention they did not even wish me a happy birthday) and then in the following weeks they invite me to a christmas dinner they're hosting for a group of friends. of course after what's happened i decline the invite and instantly get a message asking why i'm not coming. 

i am furious. i am somebody that forgives people for literally everything, and i feel like that's the reason they're shocked i haven't just got over it. as well as anger i can't help but feel incredibly guilty for declining their invite. am i being an asshole if i just cut these people off?

"for being upset that my boyfriend shouts at my friends for not following his american customs when we live in england?. long time lurker, desperately need outside judgement on this because all my real life responses are so mixed.

i (22f) have been with my boyfriend (30) for a few months now. he moved to england just over two years ago. i really like the guy but he has so many issues regarding english 'culture'/norms and he's making no effort to change them.

we went out with my friends for dinner last week at a really popular british chain. two of the people we went out with work at other branches of the same chain. we all ate our meals and had a great time, but after we all left my boyfriend was in a real mood. we were heading to a bar to get some drinks and out of nowhere he just snapped 'i think it's absolutely disgusting that not one of you left a tip, do you know how much those wait staff earn?'. one of my friends who works at another branch said 'over £8 an hour?' (a couple of pounds above minimum wage) and he just sulked. when we got home that night he was still moody, and i tried to explain to him that we just don't really tip here very often because the servers get paid hourly. he thinks it's disgusting.

he also has an issue with me just being on the pill. in england, people in committed relationships with no stds tend to just use one form of contraception **(note: i'm not looking for judgement on whether these norms are right or not)** and for me, my preferred one is the pill. he went crazy about this, saying that we have to use condoms (changed his mind later that night when he wanted sex) and where he's from taking just the pill is 'begging to be pregnant'.

he does things like this a lot. there's smaller examples, like getting pissed off when my brother (who is 18, legal age to drink here) drinks alcohol in front of him. my sister is at university and he refuses to call it anything but 'college' when college here is something you do before you're able to go to uni (and is typically, at least in my part of the uk, seen as something less academic students do).

i know that he's being rude and i'm not the asshole for that, but we recently had a fight about it in which i declared 'if the only thing you like about this country is the free healthcare and that they speak english, you should fuck off'. since then, he's been really upset. i don't think he knows how annoying he was. for shouting at him rather than speaking?

&#x200b;

edit: he said we have to use condoms alongside the pill and went on a rant about how one form isn't enough. i don't have an issue with condoms.",3
"not telling husband i know he's gay. i've known my husband is gay for several years now. at the very least he's a gay-leaning bi-man. our sex life has deteriorated consistently over the course of our marriage, and a few years ago i found his stash of gay porn on his work laptop (wasn't snooping, it as on accident).

the thing is, i actually enjoy my marriage. my husband is kind and considerate. we have three beautiful kids (9, 12, 14). he makes a lot of money and takes care of us well, while i am a home maker and enjoy taking care of him.

so i've just kept quiet and let him keep it to himself. i don't want to bring up in case he decides to leave or it implodes the family. i don't want my kids to have to go through that, at least until they're older.

so i've just kept quiet and let my husband stay in the closet, enjoying the fantasy/porn in his private time.

"for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?. hello,

&#x200b;

i wanted to ask: for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?

&#x200b;

last month i took part in a retreat. the location's internet didn't work, so we all just had our mobile data. there was a deaf participant from russia, and he couldn't access the mobile network with his phone. so he asked me if i could give him access through hotspot so he can communicate with his family.

i have limited mobile data, i get 500mb per month and from there on, i pay 5 bucks for each 100mb (it's pretty expensive here). i only use mobile data for whatsapp and maybe sometimes to check my schedule. 

so i agreed to give him hotspot under the condition that he only uses it for whatsapp. no videos, no excessive photo transmissions because it's limited. he agreed.

&#x200b;

but when i got lasts month bill i was kinda shocked: he apparently used over 6gb additionally. i was able to track it down to him because this huge amount of data was consumed during these two retreat days. but before confronting him via facebook, i asked a friend who was his roommate, if he noticed anything. he told me that this russian guy did sign language videochat the whole night through with his parents. i asked my friend if he had the impression that it were an emergency, but he said that their chat seemed very lighthearted and included lots of laughing.

&#x200b;

so i don't know what to do. the bill is over 60 bucks, my budget doesn't really allow it. and i told the deaf guy in advance to only use whatsapp, but i didn't get a warning that he was using so much data, so he maybe didn't even realize it. in addition, my friend told me that i should give him the benefit of being disabled where videochatting is often the easiest way of communication...",3
"if i take my coworker to hr for touching my car?. okay, so here's the story.

 
when my old car broke down, my grandma gave me hers. it's a 2014 honda accord, and the thing has basically just been sitting in her garage for the past 5 years. it's in mint condition, and has crazy low mileage.

 
now, my coworker, ""louis"", has always kind of given me the creeps. he's in his late 40's, but goes around hitting on all the girls in the office that are in their 20's. he just has this totally fake vibe about him, and i've just tried to stay as far away from him as i can.
 
when i rolled up in my new car, he absolutely lost him mind. he starts asking me all the specs, details, other car stuff. then he asks me if he can take it for a test drive. i tell him absolutely not. honestly, who even asks that?
 

later, i come out and he is inspecting my car, running his hands all over it. i asked him wtf he was doing, and he said he was just making sure i got a good buy. he then asks if i can let him inside so that he can see the interior. i said, and i quote ""louis, no. don't touch my car, don't look at my car, you're never going inside of it.""
 

now, if it couldn't get any worse, he brought a bag of candies to work. he was trying to give some to me. i said no. when i got out to my car, he had taken them out of the packaging and laid them out all over the hood of my freaking car. since it was hot, they got sticky (edit to clarify: didn't fully melt but got really sticky and gross) and i had to take my car to the wash. i honestly feel like i'm in the freaking twilight zone at this point.


he came in to my office this morning and started making more jokes about taking my car. i got up, without saying a word, and left my own office. now i'm wondering, for taking this up with hr?

edit/some clarifying information: this happened on work property. we have assigned spots, he is next to me. i didn't take any pictures of the candy (although i should have). i have no clue how long it actually sat on my car for, but it wasn't really melted. just partially melted/a bit sticky.",3
"update: for not wanting to be the maid of honor at my best friends wedding...pregnant and marrying my ex. i drove 7 hours to talk it out with her.. i got so many nice comments on my original, and my first ever gold,  i figured i owed everyone an update and sort of what i'm thinking now after getting a chance to talk it out with tammy and see gregory for the first time in almost 2 years. i needed the original is here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/aneyb5/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_the_maid_of_honor_at/


i posted the original on tuesday morning. i pretty much couldn't focus on anything else so i took the rest of the week off to have a self pity party. that wasn't working so i just decided screw it, i'm going to drive 7 hours to see tammy and just tell her how i was feeling. i texted her on the way and she said she was happy i was coming. i really wanted to address all the very good questions you good people had brought up in my post from tuesday. 

so i got there and we basically hugged hello and i have to admit i was very happy to see her. what was so fucking weird is it was obvious gregory was living in her place now. i don't even know why i hadn't even thought about this but he's a pretty messy dude so when i saw cereal bowls on the coffee table and socks on the floor (shit that used to drive me up the wall)...i was like wow...this is real. thank god greg wasn't there and tammy apologized that she just didn't feel good enough to clean up before she heard i was coming. 

so our conversation basically centered around what happened and why she never told me. at first she was kind of talking around it to spare my feelings and i got sort of frustrated with her and told her to please just tell me what happened. so it turns out they went out as a group right after i gave her greg's number and they just had an immediate attraction. they said that for the first few times they hung out it was all just reminiscing about our college days and never mentioned the attraction. i guess about two weeks of hanging out they kissed for the first time and she was so pissed at herself she blocked his number and didn't see him for almost a month. i guess she got lonely again, they ran into each other and admitted they had real feelings. she said she texted me and told me she wanted to talk about it right after they agreed to start dating (i found this out on my own on tuesday after going through my texts, but since i was so busy i wasn't very nice to her) but she knew i was busy and really wavered on interrupting the most important time in my professional career vs telling me some very hard to swallow news. she said rightly or wrongly she decided to tell me in person when she saw me again. fast forward a little bit i guess they so serious they talked about eloping after only two months and were pretty much living together. she said they had a drunken new years even party and just weren't careful and that's when she assumes she got pregnant. she said she knew then that it was an in person conversation she had to have with me, her first free weekend was last weekend. 


so i basically responded to all of this by saying i just didn't know how to feel. that in my brain i knew gregory and i were not compatible but my heart always hoped we'd grow up and be able to make it work and she was my best friend and i basically hooked them up. and i just don't know how to deal with all this. i know it's over but even seeing his shit on her floor was sort of painful (honestly, that would have been a massive fight between greg and i, like i said tammy is much more chill). i told her that i would always love her and always be her friend but an april wedding is probably just too soon to be involved in a wedding party. she said she totally understood. 


we talked about the elephant in the room for maybe 20 more minutes but honestly we were just talking in circles, saying the same thing over and over again. so we just sort of moved on to how she was feeling, how work was going, me apparently wearing some sort of man repellent because i can't even hook up on tinder  and all the other things friends usually talk about.  tammy is in full blown morning sickness so she must have barfed 15 times in the first two hours of me being there. at first i just let her do her thing...but then i felt really bad because we've been friends for over 20 years and i'm not even helping her. so i went in and helped put her hair in a pony tail and rubbed her back. and that's when it hit me that i would absolutely regret it and never be able to forgive myself if i weren't there for her wedding, pregnancy and having a baby...no matter who she was marrying. 


we went to lunch and at that point i told her i was sorry i was being selfish and i would be her maid of honor. she said no way i was being selfish but would never have another maid of honor besides me. it's not going to be the easiest thing in my life but i can't not do it. 


so we went back to her apartment and gregory was home. suddenly i felt like such an idiot because i couldn't possibly be in their wedding, let alone ever be around the two of them together. that was the most awkward hello i've ever had in my life (and thank god he'd cleaned up because i was just amped up with nerves to scream at him like i would have in the past). we sort of awkwardly sat on their couch not saying much but after a few minutes i just started telling myself again to grow up, don't let my own feelings get in the way of two people who may really belong together. 


seeing them in person together is even more saccharine sweet than i thought possible. they are perfect for each other. gregory is supportive (i don't know how many times i had to claim best friend privilege when she got sick over loving fiance privilege) and sweet and she's far more tolerant of him than i could ever possibly be. it was still hard for the rest of the evening but i think it will get better with time. i decided again i would be in heir wedding. 

we had dinner and i got a hotel because even though i'm trying, i'm not ready to sleep in the same house as them. tammy has to work today so i'm just hanging out before i see her for lunch than i'm going to drive back home.  we have a long, long way to go but i'm so glad i came to see her because at the very least we saw each other and talked it out and i'm very happy that i'm going to be involved in these major life events with her. 


thank you so much for all the input the other day and thank you for reading all this. 

tl;dr: my best friend is pregnant and marrying my ex boyfriend. she told me on sunday, i had an post that blew up on tuesday and i travelled to see her yesterday to hash it out. things are uncomfortable but she is and will always be my best friend and i've decided i'm going to be in her wedding. 


edit: guys holy shit! this has blown up again. i literally just got home and have over 200
inbox notifications. thank you so much for the gold and silver. i can't waif to read all this! thank you so much!


edit 2: i totally passed out last night so i didn't get to participate like i would have. i have to jump in and defend tammy, maybe no one will see this because it's probably time this fades. maybe no one will belive me but for all the critisms of her there's a good explanation that can most likely be explained away by me being a bad writer or not wanting this to be a narcissistic novel. for example, i saw someone saying ""tammy should have called after the first kiss."" i've known her for so long to know that she knows i can be very irrational and angry (i alluded to it in the other post but i had to do a year of anger management therapy because i can be like dynamite when i get pissed, i'm way better now but she probably has legit ptsd from some of my freak outs) and she figured it was a one time thing so why poke the bear if that makes sense. 

secondly, i can't stress enough how busy i was last fall. not an exaggeration to say i was working 16+ hours a day with maybe a day off every 20-30 days. i was planning a huge event that centered around a true narcissist and he would have me on my phone, texting questions and answers all day long. the last thing i wanted to do in my time off was get on my phone. i can count from that period and i'd say it averages 10 to 1 of tammy texting me (i assume calls were worse) but one stretch i think i counted she texted me 40 times before i texted her back. it's bad timing more than anything because anyone of those may have been when she wanted to tell me. and i definitely appreciate her thoughtfulness of not wanting to spring it on me while i was losing my mind from lack of sleep at work. i agree with her that this was an in person conversation anyways. 

i know tammy is just an internet sprite to all but one of you (and that is so f-ing tworedditorsonecup thing, i wish i had the energy to do another post) but she is a real person who has been my ride or die since we were 10 and 11. we've fought, screwed each other over so many times and we've always forgiven each other because having her in my life is way more important than pining over a guy i spent most of my time frustrated with anyways. don't get me wrong, i'm still pining and i cried last night over this...but like so many people said, maybe tam-tam's best gift to me as a friend was forcing me to get on with shit...maybe 10 years and 40+ breakups and just as many  broken dishes and slammed doors...she was the sign the universe sent to make me move on from a guy who wasn't right for me.

"for telling a regular customer that he isn't as beloved as he thinks and banning him?. i manage a small cafe in a college town. we are one of the places who doesn't have wifi because we only have 6 indoor tables and wifi encourages people 'camping' tables all day, which is bad for business (we aren't one of those ""no wifi, just talk to each other!!!"" places, it's just better for turnover this way. edit to add: we don't ask patrons who spend a long time there to leave or try to rush them in any way).

we have one regular who i'll call sam who comes in every day, without fail, and camps out for 4-6 hours. sam is about 35 and i believe is a grad student or was one at the nearby university. he clearly thinks he is a beloved regular and talks to the staff/hangs out near the counter every moment he thinks we aren't busy and basically drives us crazy. this has been going on for almost a year but was especially bad all summer when our front of house staff was all female (just a coincidence based on who quit for the summer). he doesn't exactly flirt with us but he pesters us with personal questions and boring stories in a way he doesn't pester male staff.

during his 4-6 hour stay, he uses a wifi... dongle thing he brings from home, laughs outloud at things he's reading online (and then comes up to the counter to tell us), tries to police other customers' behavior around tables/chairs/cream and sugar/trash, and just stares at us waiting to pounce when we don't have a customer at the counter. during all this, he buys one small cappuccino, no tip, and sometimes paws through our day-old stuff and tries to get us to toast/heat it 'for him' even though it's against the rules.

after months of me politely but firmly trying to correct his behavior, he tried to police a group who pushed two tables together saying 'that isn't how we do it here' (this isn't even a rule here!) and i snapped. i pulled him aside, told him he's been driving us crazy for a year, that me asking him to leave us alone while we work has fallen on deaf ears, and he's banned. he had a fit of course but he did finally leave and hasn't been back.

the staff and actual beloved regulars are split. some feel bad for him because they think he's just a lonely dork and he didn't really break any hard and fast rule. my two favorite regulars and all of the female front of house staff are happy but the male staff members and other manager (who doesn't work during sam's 'visiting hours') think i was too harsh. our other banned customers are banned for like, putting poop on the bathroom walls or stealing, so being annoying isn't a capital offense, but i really believe his annoyingness was bad for business and staff morale.",3
"for wearing a white dress to a wedding?. i know you're technically not supposed to do that but the bride of this one wanted a different type of wedding. she wore a black dress to the wedding and i knew beforehand she'd do this. i literally wore a cheap, white summer dress and all the girls were making petty comments about me throughout the night. 

one of the bridesmaids walked up to me, a disgusted look on her face and says ""dont you know you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding?""

i responded with, ""for fucks sakes thats only so you dont upstage the bride! shes wearing black!"" to be fair, i shouldn't have been so mean about it but for hours these girls had been staring at me, giving me nasty eyes and making comments about me. i dont even think the bride cared, she seemed to enamored by her husband to be aware of anything else

"for ""causing a scene"" with police in front of my gfs new apt?. i left my gfs apartment to pick up my nephew who was staying for the night, and to pick up some food. coming back, as i'm driving in, i make a wrong turn because its a new place, so i took the long way to her unit. i'm definitely driving a bit slower than usual traffic because everything is still new to me, plus there are a bunch of speed bumps and my car is lower. a cop followed me as soon as i turned in.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

once i parked, i texted my gf that a cop was following me. i get our stuff when he cuts the spotlight on me and turns on his lights. by this time we're already out of the car. he walks up to me and asks me what i'm doing. in general, my philosophy is to say very little to police when i'm approached in an official capacity. i've had some run-ins before, and my nephew has priors.

&#x200b;

i responded matter of factly, ""nothing really. you?"" i thought it was a friendly conversation. thats my normal response to anyone asking me that question. he tells me he's the one that asks the questions, not me. ok. i'm also the one that doesn't answer questions so if we want to go that route. he asks me why i went the wrong way, and why was i driving so slow. i just say that i don't agree with the premise, and that neither one of those things are crimes. he says, ""what are you, a sovereign citizen? give me your id.""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

by this time, he's been shining his flashlight inside my car looking for shit. my gf is out front, and due to his lights 2 sets of neighbors are also out front. i state that again, i didn't commit a crime and since this isn't a stop and id state i don't have to id myself. i wasn't pulled over, i was approached after i was already parked. he says he got a call that someone who fit my description and matched my car was driving around the parking lot looking inside of cars, there was a recent car theft in that lot. he literally started following me the second i pulled in, which was 2 minutes ago, so i know thats bullshit. my gf speaks up to say something, and i tell her i've got this.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

he then turns to my nephew and demands id. i tell him that he's a minor, and i don't give him permission to speak to him. i say that lets not act like he didn't run my plates, so we both know he knows who i am, and unless i'm being detained, i'm leaving. i walk inside and make sure they both follow me. nothing else happens.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

she's really upset that i would speak to the police in that manner, especially considering they have had some minor crime recently. i was never rude, i just don't want to answer a bunch of questions. she's also highly embarrassed that i would do this in front of her neighbors. do what? i'm not the one that turned the discussion sideways, and i'm not the one that started lying. also, we're black while my gf and her apartment complex is all white. that may have something to do with how i've experienced police encounters versus how she has.  

&#x200b;

edit:  they've had a couple of car break-ins, and 1 home break-in within the past 2 months or so.  they put a cop on site for nights like this.  gf insists its just for security, and its the same as having to check-in at the front in a gated community.  lots of people have apparently been questioned, and all you have to do is tell them where you're going and give them your id.  although i'm glad they're being proactive, i still feel like i didn't sign up for all of that.",3
"for refusing to feel my pregnant wife's belly kicks?. my wife is five months pregnant with our first child. recently, she has felt some small kicks from the baby. i tried to feel for a few nights, but no kicking. then on saturday, my best friend was over playing games with the two of us. we started talking baby stuff, and my wife mentioned that the baby has started kicking. my friend, who was very happy and excited, asked if he could feel her belly, and she said, ""no, but i appreciate you asking."" my friend was visibly upset/discouraged, but we moved on. my friend slept over after having a few drinks, but after he left the next morning, my wife and i talked about it and i told her that i was upset that she didn't let my friend feel her belly. she said that it was her body and she didn't want anyone but her mom or me touching her belly. so i told her that i will not be touching her belly and that that was my choice and i thought she was being unfair to not let my friend (30 and single) experience that life growing inside of her. she cried a lot and we talked a lot more, but it just seems selfish to me. am i the asshole here?
tldr: wife didn't let my friend feel her pregnant belly, so i decided that i would not be feeling her pregnant belly.

update : looks like i am an asshole. i'm at work and texted her that i'm excited to feel our baby and that i'm sorry for being an asshole.

update 2: while i completely do understand that i was being immature and petty, many people are calling my friend a perv. i think it's a very normal desire to want to feel a baby kick in the womb? also, all clothes were on. at no point did he ask to feel her bare belly. 
i now understand that i have no say in who is allowed to touch her belly and who is not allowed.

update 3: not sure if it is at all relevant, but my wife went back home for the week (before any of this happened) and my sister was the first person to feel baby's kicks, after my wife invited her to feel. my wife and i hadn't had the conversation of who is allowed to feel and who is not allowed to feel, so i figured if my sister was allowed, then our friend would be allowed. i shouldn't have assumed, but that was my line of thinking.

update 4: just got home from work, got her a big bouquet of flowers and sat down and hugged her and tried to feel baby. we talked about it and i texted her the link to the post. i told her i was stupid and that i fucked up big time and that i was very sorry. she accepted my apology and she's getting ready for work while i make her breakfast.

final update : i did hear you all loud and clear. fuck me, yes i'm the asshole here. to be honest, i was very excited that our friend was excited for us. i was then just discouraged that it seemed like he was being stifled. but my wife felt uncomfortable. that's that. end of story. i should've been fully supportive of her wishes in this situation and i wasn't. we're 4 years into a very young relationship (i'm 22, she's 21). i know that i have a ton of growing to do and i get that i fucked up here. i'm trying my best and sometimes my best sucks ass. i'm trying to be excited for this baby (i'm mainly terrified), and i fucked up. thank you for showing me what needed to change.",3
"if i confronted my boyfriend for tipping a waiter $60 instead of spending the money on me?. i'm kind of convinced that i'm overreacting and am in fact ta but i want other opinions first. also, i'm tired so i'm going to make this as clear and concise as i can.

my bf (20m) and i (18f) have been dating for going on a year now. we started out as fwb but then we both developed feelings. in the beginning stage of our relationship he would constantly take me out to dinner and buy me random things he found and thought that i would like (nothing ever expensive just a cute stuffed animal or figurine that he saw for example). at the same point in this relationship i would reciprocate these actions. i would bring him food to work when i went into visit him, i would buy him random presents and would surprise him with random dinners just so he knew that i cared about him.

fast forward a couple months and he's still doing everything listed above just less frequently. he developed financial struggles and eventually quit his job and was unemployed for about a month. during this time he completely stopped spending any money on me and it was entirely me spending money when we went out or did something together. this didn't bother me at all as i understood it was only a temporary situation and i loved him.

he got his job back about three months ago making decent money (we make about the same amount) and i have recently moved about an hour and a half away to go to college so we only see each other every two weeks. 

the problem for me comes in because i am the only one making an effort to drive the hour and a half to either visit home for the weekend or take him up to my dorm. this costs quite a lot in gas. after i make the drive i am the only one who spends money on dates or anything we decide to do when we hang out and he frequently asks me if i can buy him food. his excuse for this is that we always hang out right before he gets paid (he gets paid on monday and we always hang out the weekend before due to work schedules) and at that point all of the money from his paycheck is gone. he never makes any effort to save money even though he knows this is going to happen every time we see each other.

today, he called me and told me that he went out with friends and tipped a waiter $60 because it was ""the best service he had ever received."" i have not said that this hurt me or anything regarding the situation at all because i don't know if i'm being an ass. if i did confront him for this?",3
"for calling a girl a cockroach after she 'jokingly' throws it away?. my friend and his gf of a few months came by for dinner and drinks this weekend along with my fiance and a couple other mutual friends. at some point i took off my wedding and engagement rings so i can cook and get chicken all over my hands (salmonella is bad kids) without worrying about them. after we eat and dishes are placed in the sink i reach blindly for my rings  since i always put them in a specific notch in the counter and only feel one.

cue panic. i asked everyone if they've seen the wedding band anywhere or if it got knocked off the counter and it got to a point where i was on all fours on the ground hyperventilating while me and our friends searched.

i showed them all a picture of it in case and the gf goes ""oh that thing? i thought it was foil i threw it away!""

record scratch. dafuq? everyone was staring at her and i'm pretty sure my face was changing colors more rapidly than metal under a blowtorch. she starts giggling and points at the trash. the trash is about half full of food prep stuff and puppy pads because we have a disabled french bulldog that literally cant control his bowels so yeah. pads.

""what it was an honest mistake! you left it with the other food stuffs and i was just trying to help!""

i asked if she was serious and she shrugged and repeated that it was just a mistake and the ring would most likely be sitting on top of everything. cursory glance said nope. my saint so offers to dig it out and i was too furious to say anything so i just nodded and glared at her. my friend (the bf) helps him too and they do end up finding it after nearly puking from the dog doo. after they wash it off they place it on a towel to dry and the gf still kept saying that she accidentally mistook it for foil.

i turn to her and in a calmness that afterwards left me shaking and lightheaded said ""you need to leave now, before i crush your face because i accidentally mistook you for cockroach.""

my friend and her gasp and our other friends kinda stared at each other and back at me.

gf bursts into tears and storms out. my friend follows her after an angry glare at me. our other friends told me i took it too far and maybe she was just playing a prank etc. they even mentioned that it was because my wedding band was not that expensive it wouldn't have been a big deal if we lost it. my so asks them to leave too as i am about to lay the wrath of god into them.

so reddit, am i the asshole here? did i overreact?

**tldr friends gf throws my ring away ""accidentally"" so i tell her to gtfo before accidentally confusing her for a cockroach.**

**edit: lots of comments to muddle thru so i'll add one here.**

thank you to all the comments even the ones saying iata. i recognize that threatening violence was not okay and i regret that part but if i'm an asshole for comparing her to a disgusting pest i don't want to be right.

some clarity as well - she never apologized which is why i dont think it was accidental. she was chuckling and snorting while my so and her bf dug through dog shit and food peels. she knew she fucked up because she didn't make eye contact with me at all while they were doing it either. even her bf doesn't think it was accidental after i talked to him today, but that it was harmless and we didn't really lose the ring and i shouldn't have called her a cockroach.

the ring, although inexpensive is sparkly and does not look like foil. it was absolutely insulting that my friends thought it was a non issue that they thought that i can just buy a new one if i had actually lost it. i'll post a picture in a bit to clear up confusion.

edit 3: last edit for the night here are the rings put together: http://imgur.com/a/zqfkyr1(http://imgur.com/a/zqfkyr1)

thank you to everyone with different perspectives. i'll say it again, i shouldn't have threatened her, yes it was in the heat of the moment but her smug laughing face pushed me over the edge. not an excuse. maybe i'm biased to not think my ring separately looks like foil but really its seeming less and less of a mistake when you consider that putting foil in compost makes no sense. she could've tossed it in the other two bins but she put it in the one we told them only food scraps and biological wet trash goes into. like they've been to our house before. the bf is still going to be my friend since honestly i don't blame him for the things she chose to do. that's her agency. not my problem.

&#x200b;

edit 4 final edit. (will be adding to this as i read through)

i have read through most-ish of the comments so i will try and answer multiples of questions here and also some clarifications.

1. *why are you wearing your wedding ring if you're just engaged?* \- my fiance and i went shopping for wedding bands together after he gave me the engagement ring. when we found one that remotely fits, we took it home and pried it open wide enough to fit the engagement ring, and i wanted to wear it already and he agreed.
2. i am also a girl, they were at my house.
3. *why is there poo in the kitchen trash?* \- we have 3 bins in the house. 2 of them are open air, one for recycling, the other for non-recycling. the poo pad + compost bin is metal and covered and double bagged. we've had our disabled dog for around 6 months and this is the method that has worked for us because it's a hassle to run outside with drippy poo pee pads 3-5 times a day.
4. i recognize iata for threatening violence. i do not feel bad about calling her a cockroach.
5. *why are you focusing your question on calling her a cockroach when you should be asking about the ""crushing her face"" deal?* \- at the time, and even now, our friends thought that the cockroach bit and telling her to leave was the bit that went too far.
6. *how do you know she did it on purpose?* \- she still hasn't apologized, even if it was accidental. she did not throw anything else away because i throw everything i don't need away as i cook. she has been to my house many times. she has seen my rings together on my finger often. **also, if she accidentally threw away some 'foil' she wouldn't have recognized that she did from seeing the picture.**
7. *but you found it so why are you still making a big deal about it?* \- if i didn't reach for my rings at the time and they left after dinner, we would have thrown away the bin and it would have been lost forever.
8. thank you to all the people that say my rings are beautiful.
9. i didn't even realize the title said ""it"" until this morning, sorry about that.
10. *why do they even know the value of the ring?* \- we found them separately on etsy and got both pieces for a bargain and bragged about it when we got them.
11. *what is the stone in the engagement ring? -* alexandrite. it changes color depending on ambient lighting.
12. we will be investing in a ring saucer to place my rings in when cooking to mitigate any future incidents.
13. *how long have you known these people? -* the gf has been around for 7-8 months and we have hung out many many times before and during my engagement. the bf has been a close friend for around 10 years and no, i am not cutting him out. the other 2 guests are acquaintances that i've known for about a year. 

i am pretty sure i missed something else but here is the dog tax of jackson(https://imgur.com/gallery/8bol5wa) that some of the people have asked for. i will keep trying to respond to the comments but this really blew up. thank you for your perspectives.

also, to the people saying it's fake because my writing style is too well thought out, or that i have great grammar... thanks i guess?",3
"if lie to my husband about having a miscarriage when in reality i'll be getting an abortion?. i 32(f) and my husband 41(m) have been together for 12 years and married for 11. 6 months into our marriage, we had our lovely daughter belle, who passed away when she was 2 years old. after my daughter's passing my husband had an affair with his close friend which resulted in a baby girl zoe. now zoe's mother was a troubled woman who suffered from post partum depression, which ultimately took her life. my husband was regretful of his actions and worked hard to prove that he was willing to be loyal from that day that on. i decided to forgive him and accept the baby as my own. 

zoe is now 6 years old and is a bright young girl. i love her but one thing which has been bothering me a lot is that zoe looks a lot like her mother. somehow when i look at her face for too long, i get triggered. 

after the cheating, i've struggled with being intimate with my husband. things improved in the last 3 years, and my husband had recently expressed his desire of having another child. he has been really desperate for a baby. now all this time, i've taken pills in secret, however, i ended up conceiving 2 months ago on a family trip. 

i forgot to take pills one morning, and  ended up pregnant. my husband is beyond excited. he cried happy tears when i told him about the pregnancy.

 zoe has been going all around telling her friends that she was going to become a big sister. my inlaws feel that this baby will finally heal our wounds. my husband talks to my belly all the time. he is being incredibly affectionate and loving. he gets emotional wherever he talks about the baby. 

now the biggest problem is that i don't feel connected to this baby at all. recently, an ex came into my life after 10 years. we have reconnected and our friendship is going strong. we often talk about our lives. he recently got cheated on and left, so we've talked to each other about our experiences. 

things took a drastic turn for me last week when i saw a dream. in the dream, i had just given birth to my baby and my husband was there holding our baby in his arms. when i looked up to see my husband's face, i saw my ex. my actual husband wasn't there in the dream and neither was zoe. 

ever since i saw the dream, i've come to the realization that i no longer see a future with my husband. i do want a family of my own someday, but i don't want a baby with him. 


i've been thinking of getting an abortion but can't tell my husband because it will destroy him. i really want to leave this marriage and start over. i want to explore where things go with my ex. our relationship ended because of distance and bad timing. i'm pretty positive my ex still has feelings for me, but has never expressed his feelings out of respect for my marriage. 

if lie to my husband about having a miscarriage when in reality i'll be getting an abortion? i plan to divorce him next year so i don't want him to know that i didn't want this baby and hurt him more.",3

"for being upset at my wife's friend for telling us we can adopt her unborn child, only for her to terminate it a week later?. i'm getting a lot of flack from my wife for being visibly upset at this woman and i am currently in a state of being where i just don't want to be around her right now. 

this woman had a rebound relationship and got pregnant. she told my wife that she preferred to go condomless and, wouldn't you know it, when she missed her period, she insisted there was no way she could be pregnant. 

my wife and i had a feeling after her third missed week that she was pregnant. at work, she asked her, 

""if you *are* pregnant, are you thinking of getting an abortion?""

the friend responded, ""absolutely not. i would literally never do that. if *anything*, adoption.""

relieved, we offered to take her child. we realized that it was financially difficult for her so we even offered to help her out money-wise as well as emotional and familial support before and after the baby was born. i'll let it be known that she actually made us believe that if she *were* pregnant, we'd adopt it. this got me emotionally attached to the idea because she said that, at the very bottom line, she'd never ever even think about abortion.

it got brought up weekly for about a month (they're really close, this wasn't intruding- just causal conversation) until she went silent. we didn't hear from her for about 10 days. she sends my wife a text and says she got an abortion.

while i understand her fear (and realistically i *don't* fully understand since i'm a guy), i feel like i got bait-and-switched with a potential child of mine. i know it wasn't mine, but the reason i'm so upset is because she actually had us believing that this child could have been a part of our lives. this goes beyond an abortion debate. it got real and emotional investment happened. 

i have a hard time seeing her, so when she comes over, my wife intentionally keeps distance by hanging out with her on the porch while i go work or hangout in the basement. i understand she's probably hurt to, but i feel hurt to, and i just need time to get to a place where i can be civil and polite, because right now, in my heart, i'm not.

**edit:**

i think people are misreading, or maybe i wrote it poorly. here was our outlook.

a. if she wants to keep the pregnancy, we will be there for emotional support and, since she's single and not really established, financial support. we would first to just be helpers, not trying to steal anyone's baby here. 

b. if she didn't want to keep the baby because of financial stress and emotional toll, we would gladly give it a home.

since she was clearly against abortion, we thought those were the two best options to keep the baby in a stable environment.

"for warning others about a girl's sti?. honestly don't think i acted assholish here given her actions, but the severe backlash i've received has me open to the idea that i am. hence i'm posting here.

to cut a long story short, i slept with a girl called madison at a toga party. we had both been drinking but not in anyway drunk. just a couple beers. the next morning a friend approached me and asked why i slept with her when she has herpes. i had no idea and obviously would not have slept with her had i known. i was annoyed she did not disclose this and feel she had a moral obligation to do so before sleeping with anyone.

when i confronted her she admitted she has genital herpes but said it wasn't a big deal, it never flares up, she hasn't passed it on to anyone etc. i don't really care for these excuses, and when i pushed her for an apology she said i was being a pansy.

following this incident, i took it upon myself to share her herpes status on our university's facebook pages anonymously. i did this so that other men (or women, if she swings that way) don't get tricked also. although it's obviously me that did it, she can't prove it, and i haven't gotten in trouble for it.

that said, she has organised a campaign against me for ""slut shaming"" and ""harassment"" against her for the posts, and successfully convinced a few groups of my guilt. the posts in question were literally bland and vanilla: ""beware of x. she has genital herpes and does not disclose this fact to those she sleeps with."" absolutely no mean words or slurs.",3
"for reporting my friends video of her naked child?. my friend recently uploaded a facebook video of her kid running around her yard and playing in her pool.  it was a typical home video type of thing. i personally have nothing wrong with the kid being naked in the privacy of their own home, but i felt like seeing close up shots of the kids privates was something that my friend might regret having on the internet. it turned out her profile ended up getting banned for a week and now she is making a few facebook statuses about how people are rude. my wife said i should have just let it be. am i the asshole?",3
"for cutting off contact with my son due to him refusing to accept his own responsibilities as a paren. i am a father to 3 ""young adult"" (ages 18, 22 and 24) sons who live with me and who for the most part have always gotten along (normal brotherly fights but nothing serious). however throughout this summer i've noticed a bit of a tension between them. i told my youngest to spill the beans since i figured the conflict was between the older two since they seemed the most tense. my youngest tired to avoid eye contact and kept trying to play dumb but i kept pushing. my eldest child had some bad history of impulsive behavior when he was a few years younger (the worst being an incident which resulted in his expulsion from college) but he had been slowly improving his life and i didn't want to be too late to help him if he had done something to jeopardize iti really didn't want my youngest keeping secrets.

when i finally got the truth out i was in shock, it turns out that middle child gathered a baby (my granddaughter) over a year ago, but had refused to even see the child. my oldest found out since he happens to work with a cousin of the mother, and he has been trying to get his brother to take responsibility and be there for his child, but he has refused. 

i confronted my middle child and we got into a huge fight. he claimed that being a father would ruin his plans for life but i told him that he had to take responsibility for his own actions and that his child deserved to have a father in her life.

this went on for a while when i told him that if he didn't think his own child deserved a father then he didn't deserve a father himself and i told him that he had to leave the house. he is 22 years old and has a decent job and plenty of friends so i wasn't too worried about him. 

i have met my granddaughter and her family and have made some plans to sell my house and downsize to begin a college fund for her since my youngest child will go to college and my oldest has been saving up to move out. 

it has been about a month now and while i feel like i made the correct decision, i still feel terrible. i chose to end my relationship with my son, which hurts so much, since i have always felt closest with him throughout his life (he had the same interests that i had and was the most willing to spend time with me) i feel horrible that i raised a kid who was willing to not care about a human he helped create, i feel like i ruined any chance of a relationship between him and my youngest son, and i feel guilty since my wife has been crying a lot the last few weeks and i don't know how to fix anything.



for this? was my reaction too strong?


edit: he is also incredibly lackluster at paying his child support, he has to be told to do it and even then he is reluctant.

edit 2: a lot of people are getting upset about my reaction to the youngest child, however my oldest and youngest both have been trying to get him to own up on his own for months before i found out

edit 3: also i have seen my granddaughter more than once, selling my house is not a knee jerk reaction since i we have been think about it for over a month and still haven't made anything official (and my wife and i came up with this idea together )",3
"for not wanting to pay for a vacation where i spent almost all of my time helping my friend recover from her butt enhancement surgery?. since this is a very specific situation, i'm using a throwaway for privacy reasons. 

**note - my friend has now said that although she is ""extremely disappointed"" in my actions, she's going to drop the money issue.  so it's not like i'm being sued or anything. i'm just posting to see if i am in the wrong with how i handled things.**

my friend recently got this butt procedure done in mexico for cosmetic reasons. i personally thought it was a little unnecessary but i try to be a good friend and support her regardless. 

she ended up inviting me to come stay at a hotel with her for a week while she recovered. then we would fly home together. i am a teacher and have summers off so i agreed to do it. there was no mention of money. (because my husband happens for an airline, i hardly ever pay for flights, so the plane tickets were covered). 

i get there and the hotel suite my friend rented is beautiful. i have my own room and everything. but my friend was in no position to do much of anything. i had to basically play nurse as she couldn't even use the restroom on her own. whenever i got a chance, i would try to eat out and go swimming or explore, but since my friend needed me, my time was limited. i managed to squeeze in one hike and that's it. obviously, it was not exactly a traditional vacation for the reasons i've outlined. 

on our last day there, my friend asked me when i thought i could ""pay her back"" for half the cost of the suite. i'm like uhhhh excuse me?? why would i pay you to play mommy/nurse for seven days?? she was pissed and we got into a big argument which obviously ruined the end of the trip.

my husband thinks it's insane that she would ask me to pay her anything. however, a mutual friend of ours is on the side of the friend who had surgery. so i'm starting to doubt myself. 

am i somehow wrong to expect that she'd cover the cost of the hotel under these circumstances? i mean, would you ask a friend to pay who spent time taking care of you?",3
"for ""ruining"" an old classmate's coming-out post?. for brief context before i explain what exactly happened here: i'm 27yo gay male and there was a dude in high school, let's call him by his initial b, who loved picking on me for being effeminate.

to be clear, i was never a girly guy on purpose, i just can't exactly change my tone of voice and mannerism that come naturally. b and his friends tormented me verbally so much i developed extreme anxiety whenever i was in their proximity.

they called me every name in the book: fag, sissy, male ugly betty (because i was overweight and pimply back in high school). then, things got 100% worse when we started having pe together. long story short, b and his friends were one of the main reasons i absolutely, positively detested high school.

well now, about a decade later, b came out as bisexual on facebook through a long, public, ""heartbreaking"" essay elaborating his personal struggles. his post popped up on my feed due to a few mutual friends commenting and liking it. ngl, i was pissed off when i read that. not saying people can't change, but since b explicitly said in his post that he knew he was into boys since kindergarten, imo that makes the fact that he tormented me in high school just for appearing gay even worse.

anyway, all of the comments under b's post were overwhelmingly supportive for him ""living his truth"". that just aggravated me to be honest. i'm not sure whether this line of thought makes me bitter or not, but i felt the need to voice my own opinion. so i wrote something along the lines of, ""that's such a cute and manipulative post b, shame you didn't consider any of this stuff when you bullied me in high school for the exact same things you're now embracing."" i wanted people to see that he's not some sort of a blameless victim of a prejudiced society, as he tried to portray himself in the coming-out post.

most of our classmates and others attacked me though, saying stuff like ""why rain on a fellow lgbt person's parade?"" and repeating all the generic stuff about people growing up, changing, finding themselves etc. one of my high school classmates even pm'd me to say, you don't even know what b went through since high school, he doesn't need your negativity, you're being petty and holding a grudge.

am i honestly the asshole here? i sure feel like one now, but i still don't *believe* i am in the wrong for criticizing someone who made my high school experience miserable and caused my anxiety.",3
"for not agreeing to house my pregnant teenage sister and her delinquent boyfriend after our parents disowned her?. my family and i grew up very poor. from when i was old enough to legally work, i (19f) have had to take on multiple jobs while balancing school to help with my family and my younger sister. growing up, i never had a lot and whatever money i earned i would spend on my sister (16f) and family. when i was 18 and had just been accepted into college, my dad's business that he'd worked on for the past couple of years finally took off. this also meant that my sister could now have a normal high school experience without worrying about money.

while i was in college, i wasn't in contact with my sister that much since i was so busy with schoolwork. however, from our calls and her social media, i could tell she had changed completely and was involved with some bad people. she would post videos on her snapchat of her getting drunk, smoking weed, juuling, driving while most likely drunk/high, etc. i tried reaching out to her, but she would mostly deny the claims and told me to mind my own business. at some point, she justified her actions using the argument, ""this is what the cool kids do now, not everyone was a nerd like you in high school."" one of my high school friends who also has a brother in the same grade reach out to me and said that she heard that my sister was seeing a sketchy guy from another school. apparently he sells drugs and was expelled from my sister's high school. i asked my sister about this and she denied it. 

last week i got a phone call from my mom who was sobbing. she tells me that my sister is pregnant. i was so shocked that i could not speak. then i was angry. when i was her age and even younger, i gave her everything and so did my parents so she could have all the opportunities her peers had. since my dad's business became lucrative, they've given her every opportunity to succeed (any extracurricular/sport she wants, academic tutoring, school activities, etc.). i never got any of those things. it angered me so much that she took all of this for granted and fucked up her life. the father? her delinquent ""boyfriend"" who got expelled and sells drugs. 

she blows up my phone but i don't respond. she then sends me a series of long text messages asking if she can crash at my place. she also asked me if i could make her an appointment to see a doctor. lastly, she asked if it would be okay if her boyfriend comes and stays over sometimes. i shut her down. i told her that you dug this hole for yourself. if you allowed yourself to become pregnant, then you should be able to deal with the consequences. also, i'm currently sharing a small apartment with two roommates! she begged some more and i denied her. in the past few days, she's still be texting me and calling me non-stop saying that she has nowhere to go and has been living in her boyfriend's car. i haven't responded to a single message of hers, but i feel my resolve wavering a bit. i fully don't support her, but maybe i'm being an asshole?

edit: to clarify, i would still never house her in my apartment. that would be extremely disrespectful towards my roommates and would get me kicked out due to the lease agreement. i meant i was considering giving in and sending her some money.

edit 2: my parents have disowned her, not kicked her out. they are refusing to acknowledge that she is their daughter, but she is still welcome to live in their house. she chose not to since my parents are absolutely fuming and probably will yell at her and criticize her, which she honestly needs.",3
"for sitting on this woman's purse.   

i'm on public transport and there's no available seats except for this ""one"" that's occupied by this lady's purse. i asked her to move it politely but she says it's too expensive to put on the floor. normally i don't give a shit but i was tired from the gym and i think exhaustion made me impulsive so i just plopped myself right next to her, onto her purse. she starts freaking out and yelling and pulls her purse right under my sweaty butt and goes to complain to the driver. obviously, the driver doesn't give a shit and the lady comes huffing and puffing back alone demanding i leave the seats. so i just plopped my gym bag right onto the other seat. i normally don't stand up for myself but i think the obnoxious nature of this lady made me use her moves against her. do you think it's an asshole move?",3
"for asking my boyfriend's parents to give us warning before coming over?. my boyfriend and i recently bought our first house. i want it to be clean and nice whenever anyone comes over. i don't think this is too much of an issue? 

a few days ago his parents turned up unannounced and let themselves in. i had just got out the bath and had to quickly run upstairs and get myself dressed as i was in a towel. the house was also messy due to laundry/just moving.

then today we were cleaning the house ready for someone coming round a bit later and his parents rang to say they are on there way and will be 5 minutes. (they live 30 mins away) my boyfriend told them that we were actually busy due to cleaning and someone coming over shortly could we do another time. his mother then sent him a page long essay on how she understands how it is now and he would be welcome to turn up whenever he wanted to her house and that one day someone won't be able to wait an hour or whatever to see us and we won't get the chance to see them again because something might happen to them. she quotes ""just remember that"" 

are we being the assholes here? 

i mean this is my house too and if i want to be able to make the house nice before someone comes or walk round the house in a towel or god forbid even naked why should i not be able to because someone may just turn up at my house at any moment? i mean seriously she can come once a day if she wants just please give us some warning. i totally get that she would allow us to come over whenever we want but are we not allowed our own boundaries? 

i love his family but this i just don't get this. ",3
"for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?. a bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. he regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.

now to us, i'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. we both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. there is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)

her family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, i respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.

so now to us, i proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. both families like each other and we all get along great. however.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... uhh what? we had our first major fight right there because we need her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.

i'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? i also found out she would have zero student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a ""real school"". she went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.

now i'm not going to argue her dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. that's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.

however i cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. i get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but i'm not wealthy enough to do that. we talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because i do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. then once our kid gets into pre-k she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.

now apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because i popped the question. not cool and her mom is fully behind her decision, the dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if i back out because i shouldn't be expected to do that unless i'm in a financial position to do so.

"for being upset over my boyfriends proposal and engagement ring?. i'll start by saying we've been together for 3 years. we have a great relationship and he's a wonderful father to our child. the proposal really came out of nowhere. i was in the bathroom getting ready to take our little one to daycare, which we were already running late for. my boyfriend walked in behind me and held a ring up in his hand and just said 'will you marry me?' i honestly thought it was a joke and the ring was simply a gift. i laughed, said yes, put the ring on and left.

when i got home and spoke to my boyfriend, i realized he actually *did* ask me to marry him. i would've said yes either way (if it was a joke or not) but i was just left feeling a bit.. disappointed and empty, i guess. i'm not the biggest fan of the ring either. it's big and chunky and uncomfortable to wear. it was meant to be sapphire to match my birthstone he said, but he 'accidentally' got the wrong colour. it's not my style and it doesn't suit me whatsoever. we've never looked at engagement rings together so he wouldn't know what i like. i mentioned this to him and asked if he would mind if i bought a smaller ring (with my own money) to wear instead but he got quite offended by that and called me ungrateful. he's been moody ever since. may i add that the ring he bought wasn't expensive, so it's not like he'd be wasting lots of money if i didn't wear it. (price doesn't matter to me.)

i wasn't expecting a grand gesture or huge proposal.. but a little effort would've been nice, not just asking me in the damn bathroom. it's meant to be a special moment and memory and it's just.. not. for being upset over this?",3
"for buying my brother-in-law condoms when i heard he doesn't use them?. my wife has a younger brother (29) who has been in a relationship with his high school sweetheart (who's also a 29 year old male) for about 12 years. i think of both of them as my family, they're my children's uncles, we spend a bunch of time together and we get along great. i recently had a vasectomy, i'm 44, we have 3 kids and we aren't planning on having any more. after one sunday lunch with our bils, we sent the kids away and us adults had some drinks and started talking about my vasectomy. at one point, i said how great it was to finally not have to worry about protection, and how great it felt without it. and i said i almost feel sorry for them not experiencing it. my bil laughed and said: what are you talking about, we haven't used protection since high school.

i was going to reply something, but the kids came running in so i dropped the topic. i later thought about what he said and talked to my wife about it, saying that i don't think it's safe for them to be having sex without condoms, as a couple of gay men, and my wife laughed at me. apparently, just because they've been together for a long time, it's safe? she told me to drop it and let them live their lives however they want.

i thought it was ridiculous of her to have that reaction to her own brother not using protection and realized she wasn't going to tell them anything about it. so i figured i would buy some condoms and give them to my bils and tell them i was worried about their safety and that they should really rethink not using protection.

a couple of days ago, we had another lunch together, we sent the kids away again, and i gave them the condoms. i rehearsed a whole speech about how i wouldn't want anything to happen to them and that they should stay safe. but, rather than seeing my gesture for what it was - a gesture of care - they were offended. they asked if i am suggesting they shouldn't trust each other? they said they had never slept with anyone else their whole lives and if they managed to have an exciting enough sex life not to cheat on each other for 12 years, they'll probably manage the same in the future. and my wife's brother also said that, by the same token, i should be continuing to wear condoms despite having had a vasectomy. after shouting at me for 10 minutes, they just left. my wife has been incredibly mad with me and demanded i apologize to them, but i refuse to apologize for caring about their health and safety. i don't see how what i did was this horrible. they could have just declined the condoms. and their arguments are ridiculous. so what if they've been together for 12 years? people have cheated on each other after being together for longer than that.",3
"for telling a kid that she's the reason i got a dashcam?.  

there are three children, elementary aged, that live on my street, two a couple houses down from me, the other across the street from them. they are constantly running into the road to cross, or after something, or riding some toy down the middle (bike, three-wheeler, scooter). as such i creep down my road past their house to get to mine. like, 10-15 mph with the clutch in and my foot hovering over the break. 

well, about a week ago i am creeping along as the kids are riding bikes down the middle of the road. the youngest is in the middle of the road heading for me, but looking behind her to her brother. i realized that she isn't going to stop so, with cars on either side so i couldn't pull over, i come to a stop in the middle of the road. 

as i am putting my car in reverse, she turns around and sees me. she swerves around me, and lets out a ""whoa."" i wait for the others to clear the road, and move past and park in my driveway. i was getting out of my car when the girl rides up behind my car. ""you almost hit me!""

i calmly told her that no, she almost hit me, and that she and her brother are the reason why i got a dashcam. (there are other benefits, but the kids were my primary motivation.) she didn't understand, but then asked about my daughter (high school age) and if she was still in school because she's so old. 

i answered, and went inside thinking nothing more of it. about an hour later there is a hammering on my door. my husband answered to see the girl's mom. she sees me and starts screaming about how horrible i am that i told her daughter that i got a dashcam because of her and her brother. 

my husband closed the door in her face and locked it. 

i recounted this to a coworker, and they said i'm an asshole for telling the kid the truth even if it didn't bother the kid. i don't think so because the kids need to learn to have more awareness around the road. so i will accept my judgment.",3
"for not leaving the house when my gf hosts a ""girls night"". so here's the deal. i'm a lesbian as is my gf. before we started dating, she already had a girls night established with some of her friends. i have no problem with this in general and kinda like having the house to myself when she goes to someone else's place and it's important to spend time with your friends. the problem is when she hosts. she expects me to leave the house. 

this feels kinda cruel to me for a few reasons. first, i don't really have anywhere to go. i end up going to see a movie alone or something and wandering around until i can come home. at the moment, i don't really have any friends to do things with. second, i'm a girl too. if the event were simply ""no partners"" and not ""girls night"" i'd get it a bit more, but a few of the women in the group dated for a bit and both were and are allowed to go to girls night. this makes it feel just kind of arbitrary that i can't attend if they are in my house, let alone that i have to leave. third, it is literally my house. i own it. my gf does contribute some financially, so i don't want to minimize her contributions, but i bought the place before we met and being kicked out of my own house does not sit well with me.

so, if i refused to leave next girls night?

**edit**: wow. way more comments than i expected. i'm putting up this edit to express my thanks. i've gained a much greater appreciation for how my so is feeling and i've changed my mind about refusing to leave. this is the women i love wanting a relatively simple thing from me fairly infrequently. as much as i hate going out on weeknights, i think i've been a bit of a stubborn asshole. it's her home too and i don't need to be there all the time.",3
"for paying my daughter to lose weight?. i (53m) have grown increasingly worried about my daughter's (22f) weight. it has gotten beyond the point of merely an aesthetic issue, and i have genuine concerns about her health.

she doesn't live at home, as she recently started graduate school out of town. our arrangement is that i pay for her tuition and rent, and she has a part time job that covers groceries, utility bills, spending money, etc. this works out well as i am happy to cover these expenses since she is in school. however, she often says that she wishes she earned more money, since she does not have a ton of spending money for leisure activities, clothes, etc.

i have tried to speak to her about her weight, approaching it as delicately as i could. she was actually quite receptive, and i could tell she was a bit hurt but she told me that she knew it was an issue that she should be addressing. however, currently she is not sufficiently motivated to do it, and is busy with her school and part time job so struggles to find time to go to the gym. 

i suggested that if she started going to the gym, i would give her extra money. this is to serve as a motivator, but also for practical reasons as she can pick up fewer shifts at her job and have more time to go to the gym.

the deal is $15 per hour spent at the gym. this is working on an honour system since i trust her, and i did not think it would be appropriate to pay her by pounds lost (could encourage unhealthy eating and so on). my wife thinks this is a ""disgusting"" idea, but i think i am helping her by replacing her shifts at her job with ""shifts"" at the gym - and financially compensating this.

so, for paying for my daughter to lose weight?

**edit:** a lot of comments about how her diet is the most important thing, rather than exercise. which is definitely fair. we did also speak about her diet, but her lack of exercise is the facet that had the most clear barrier (lack of time and motivation) which is why that is what i am addressing. hopefully her diet will improve as well, especially since she should have some extra money in her pockets for more expensive groceries from this arrangement.",3
"for ""ruining 3 relationships"". i am a married woman who was happily married up until a few days ago.  recently my husband started talking about a new girl at work.  i thought, fine, i trust him, and he has other female friends.  

soon i noticed the way he talked about her was different.  he seemed really giddy, almost like when we were dating.  it bothered me a bit, partly because she is 19 and i am 36, but once again, i trusted him, so i left it alone.  

occasionally when he was texting her i would ask what they were talking about, and he gave me vague answers.  

one day i came home and found him talking on the phone with her.  this bothered me.  when he got off the phone i told him how much it bothered me.  i asked to see the messages between the two of them.   he said that they were private.  

he mentioned that the two of them had played a game where they guessed secrets about each other, and he gave his word not to show it to anyone.  i told him i felt this was too intimate of a conversation for ""friends"" to be having.  

he mentioned that she really didn't want her boyfriend to know they were talking.  red flags went off in my mind.  i told him he needed to stop talking to her.  he refused, saying he didn't want to lose his friend.  

eventually i decided to let the boyfriend know that they were talking and sharing secrets.   i figured i would want to know if i were him.  he said she had cheated on him multiple times before, and when he asked her about it she denied everything.   

after all of that, they broke up.  she told my husband to stop talking to her, therefore ending their friendship, and my husband and i are in a weird space now.  am i the asshole for ruining three relationships?",3
"to be creeped out by how a waiter treated my daughter and for making her say thank you?. during a long road trip i stopped off with my 4yo daughter for dinner at a family run rest stop type cafe/restaurant we've been to many times before. my daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  she also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  

she'd been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  i think he handled it really well and i was more than happy for them to be talking.

a bit later we were sitting at our table and i noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with i was proud as she'd clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she'd been pretty funny.

when he brought the food over though he didn't acknowledge me at all and said directly to her ""do you know you are really beautiful?"" she was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn't look up or respond and so he said it again.  i got her attention and said ""the man is talking to you"" he said it again and she just stared at him so i made her say thank you. 

i was uncomfortable for a few reasons: 

i didn't like his tone or the look on his face, i've seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman

it's one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but i found his word choice ""beautiful"" inappropriate

i made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable 

&#x200b;

later on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake i hadn't ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it's their secret and not to tell mum.

i feel like i witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  

&#x200b;

or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  

also did i let her down by making her thank him when i thought he was being a creep?

i'm a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks i should complain to the restaurant.

"for being angry at a woman flirting with me and reporting her to the college authority?. so, first of all....let me just tell you guys i am ugly. ugly as ugly can be.
i won the ugliest guy in high school competition 4 years in a row and was relentlessly bullied.
fortunately college is a lot better. i still don't have any friends but i get to keep to myself and no one bullies me as such. i get to make my own little world and i feel fortunate:)

when i was walking to the library today, an extremely attractive woman started hitting on me. at first i was in disbelief and asked her if she had the wrong person. but she said she would be willing to carry my babies in a joking tone and had a chat with me.
after about 2 minutes and me literally holding back tears because i had never felt so loved in my life, she tells me she was filming a 'fun' youtube video where she told random guys she would have their babies.
apparently the channel is pretty popular and people like stuff like this.
i told her i wasn't comfortable with being in the video and that this was harmful and would ruin people's self esteem. she tells me i should feel good because i am 'definitely not the best looking guy on campus' and that they needed 10-15 more people to finish the video.

i was honestly indifferent at the ugly part because i was used to it but this felt like a shitty thing but i didn't want other guys to go through it and cameras were technically not allowed so i reported to the campus authorities about it and they have banned anyone from their channel from shooting videos at our university again.

honest opinion would be appreciated! sorry if i made any grammatical errors, i am in a hurry. thanks for your time guys.

"for calling my wife insecure. my wife (33f) and i (33m) were at a family dinner at my parents house with my brother (30m) his wife (29f) and their new baby, the little guy is about 11 weeks old. my mom and her family have always been one to compliment people on their looks and weight, so when my sil came over with the baby, my mom and aunt were gushing about how great she looked. she is a fairly active person  and does stay in shape, which is good for her, however, she embarrasses easily and is quite uncomfortable when people talk about her body, she just made a comment on breastfeeding alot and taking walks with the baby.

my wife was sitting next to me, rolls her eyes and starts muttering to me that ""i'm sure throwing up your whole pregnancy didn't help either"" i gave her a look but didn't comment, she made snide remarks about my sil the whole night.

on the car ride home, my wife is going on and on about my sil, how smug she must be to be looking like she does so soon after having a baby, and how full of her self to be putting her appearance before being a mother, and then brought up the vomiting again. 

now i've known my wife since we were in junior high, and she's always made comments about other girls like this, always. she's a bit on the bigger side and seems to have a resentment towards thinner women. anyway, i pointed out that my sil wasn't making herself sick, but had a condition while pregnant that caused her to be like that (can't think of the name of it). my wife laughed and said she was sure that's what she wanted us to think, and that my sil has always been about her looks, and that she was surprised the baby wasn't scrawny, considering she can't possibly eat enough to be feeding him.

i got really annoyed and said it was my mom and aunt that always made comments, not my sil, and told my wife she didn't have to be so snide. 

my wife went off at me for defending my sil, and starting asking/ accusing me of finding her attractive. i was so blown away by her melt down that i told her i didn't want to talk to her for the rest of the ride home, she took this as me saying i do find my sil attractive, i told her no, that i just don't want to deal with her insecurities right now. 

well, my wife started crying, calling me cruel and  that i don't have to point out the fact that's she's insecure. still annoyed by her accusations, i told her she doesn't have to tear people down to make herself feel better.

when we got home she went straight to bed and i get a lovely explosion of texts from her friends telling me how much of an ass i am.  i know her feelings are hurt but i don't think she has to make comments about others who have done nothing to slight her other then looking the way they do.

edit: i love my wife very much and my attraction to her has never changed,  but, like i said, she has always been like this ever since we were kids. i have made comments however in the past about the way she talks about other people and if she ever wanted to talk to someone about it. she would either  laugh at me and say she has said what needs to be said, or get annoyed.  her mother and sister are actually the same way, but whenever i say anything, they get defensive and say it's just what girls do and that there is no harm to it.

edit: so my wife came home from work and not gonna lie, i thought it would be worse due to the fact that she works with the women who were texting me, and that today would be a bitch fest about me.

we talked and the first thing she asked me was if i find her attractive, i said i always have, however, her attitude is beginning to wear me down and the only thing i want to apologize for is not having a clear conversation about it sooner, that i do stand by what i said, but that i would be there with her to work out why she feels the need to talk about other women so harshly. she got on the defense again, saying that wasn't an apology and that it constantly feels like my sil is trying to show her up whenever they are together.  i pointed out that she was doing it again, and she said it was hard for her to believe i want to support her when i don't have her back. i told her me agreeing with her about her comments isn't supportive, and she needs to understand that what she says isn't okay, and that i will no longer tolerate toxic comments about my family. she started crying again saying that that's how she copes with  sometimes feeling unhappy with herself, that most of what she says has truth and that people like my sil are vein. i recommend we talk to someone about this, she refused. i told her  to take the night to think about what she says, and how she would feel if these things were being said about her, to call me if she needed me, and headed to my mom's house. 

edit: thank you all for the suggestions and support, it sucks to think about how my wife may feel about herself and how many others (myself included ) might have to deal with their insecurities, but i know that her way isn't healthy or going to fix anything, and i wish i had actually addressed it before it came to her bashing my sil for being sick while pregnant. i'm also very sorry for all of you that went or are going through that sickness while pregnant, i only knew very little from my mom about what was happening with my sil, and reading about it on here makes me feel even worse that someone i love could make such crude comments about it.",3
"for not letting my in-laws move in with us?. my husband and i recently got married and purchased a four bedroom house (the number of bedrooms is important). my husband and his family are originally from ohio (we live in utah) and his family has started moving out here for a fresh start. almost immediately after buying our house his younger brother moved in with us and has been here for about eight months; he's a great roommate and pulls his weight around the house. about 2 months ago my sil decided she needed a new start and she moved in with us (also a great roommate) now that my husband and his two siblings are living here his parents decided to move here also. i work from home and keep my home office for myself to get work done. when my in laws asked about moving down here my whole household was thrilled. when i then asked ""who's giving up their bedroom?"" everyone just went silent. i unfortunately had to pull rank on everyone and put my foot down and say i was keeping my office as of right now no one is speaking to me.

yes bil and sil pay rent. bil is off a divorce and has been talking about moving out ""some time this year"" he's a great guy and finally been getting back on his feet.   sil hasn't made the best choices in life and currently working on moving up the ranks at her job she handles most of the cleaning and pays about $200 a month in rent. mil and fil want to move in until they can find a house but i don't think they are going to move quickly on looking for said house. yes, i am a man.

"for not caring about my ex's family tragedy?. i dated my ex for 3 years and ended up finding out she was cheating for about half of that time. i broke up with her about 4 months ago and she moved out of my house. i ended up hearing from friends that she was painting me as the bad guy who drove her into the beds of all those guys she cheated with. no one believed her and she ended up isolating herself from the friend group because people really didn't like the way she handled things as far as cheating and with the break up.

her parents recently were killed in a bad car accident. it's a shame, they were very good people. i enjoyed the time i spent around them and they treated me well. they died about 5 days ago. 

my friends have been telling me over the past few days that she was asking about me and saying she wishes she could be with me and talk to me about the loss and apologize. 

i don't buy the bullshit. this isn't about her being sincerely remorseful about anything. this is her wanting to manipulate me into emotionally supporting her through this. her parents dying sucks and i'm sure that's awful to deal with, but it is firmly her problem, not mine. 

i told my friends this and they said they'd soften it but make sure she knows i'm not the one she should be calling or coming to.

she came over to my house early this morning a mess and crying and apologizing and begging at my doorstep. i thought about what i'd say but everything was going to be needlessly cruel so i just shut the door and she screamed so loud and for so long my neighbors called the police.

i didn't get in trouble or anything but it was embarrassing and i had to deal with explaining things to them(it sure was fun explaining the context of her saying her parents were dead and crying on my doorstep). 

my standing on this is pretty much that it sucks for her and more for her parents. but this isn't my job anymore—to deal with supporting her through anything.",3

"for unintentionally revealing what a fellow bridesmaid did at a bachelorette party, in front of her fiance?. last weekend, there was a bachelorette party for my friend, becca, who is getting married. becca had a great time! we all did. 

it was a three night affair, and a male stripper came the last night we were there. becca's good friend, anna, got really into the stripper. i don't know anna very well- we've only met a few times, but she's nice and we get along great. anna is engaged and getting married sometime this winter (haha i don't know the date honestly). we're bridesmaids together. 

anna was even more about the stripper than the bride. when the stripper got naked, so did she. she was basically shoving her boobs at the guy. she licked whipped cream all over him. etc. which, you do you boo! she did mention to me her fiance probably wouldn't be ok with it. i chuckled awkwardly. please note that everyone was well aware of the stripper coming and in agreement - it's not something that was sprung upon anyone! another bridesmaid (neither me nor anna) arranged the stripper. 

last night was becca's wedding. the wedding was beautiful. at one point during the reception, i was (drunkenly) talking to anna, another friend, and anna's fiance. the other friend couldn't attend the party so we were all recounting our tales and laughing. i was very drunk at this point. i said ""and then anna took her clothes off! you should've seven her with the stripper!"" something to that effect. 

ummm... anna's fiance goes ""a stripper?!"" turns out he didn't know a stripper was coming at all. 

last i saw them, they were in a very heated conversation. :/ i apologized and anna said ""well now fiance is ready to call off our wedding so fucking thanks."" she is really upset. i feel bad. my husband said it's not my responsibility to uphold and remember her lies, especially when i'm drunk. my mom disagrees and says i should've been more discreet.

"for refusing to show my receipt when leaving a store?. just recently, our local walmart and target have begun to ask for receipts as patrons are leaving the store. at first i would oblige. i thought ""whatever, it will only take a few seconds, nbd"". but as it happens more and more, i'm starting to realize not everyone is being asked to do this. often times i'm having my groceries checked against my receipt as i watch multiple people walk right past us.

i thought maybe they were just looking over receipts whenever possible. but one time the ""greeter"" wasn't busy with anyone else. i watched 4 or 5 shoppers walk right out without a word from her, but as i was about to leave, she asks me aside.

at this point i start thinking, i'm a young male shopping alone, maybe i'm being profiled. so, after she asks politely to see my receipt i respond with ""no thanks."" and continue out of the store. she looked a little puzzled, but...

wow, nothing happened. that's an awful lot more convenient than being ""nice"". so, that's been my default response for the past few weeks. a greeter asks me to provide my receipt and i say ""no thanks/no/nope/nah/maybe next time/etc."" with no issues. that is, until last night.

i was on my way home from work, when my roommate asks me to pick up a jar of peanut butter. so, i get to the store, find the peanut butter, ring myself up, pay, and make my way to the doors. as i'm leaving, an older man says ""hold up! let me see your receipt."", to which i respond ""nah."", and continue on my way. he stands up from his chair, raising his voice just a little, and says ""you need to pay for that!"", and i respond ""i did, have a good night!""

this is when it gets a little weird. he's clearly unconvinced, and begins to yell ""you have to show me your receipt!"" while following me out into the parking lot. i stop, turn around, and say ""i paid for this, it's my property now, transaction complete"". he just gets even angrier, demanding that i show him my receipt, yelling ""you have to pay for that"" and ""you have to show me your receipt"" non stop.

eventually i make it to my car, which he proceeds to stand in front of. now, he's saying he's going to call the police, yadda yadda. i roll down my window and tell him ""that's fine, you can call them, i don't mind. can you get away from my car?"", and he responds ""like hell i will!"" while slamming his hands onto the hood of my car.

at this point i just want to go home. i look around my car and there are no people or cars anywhere nearby. so i quickly reverse my car away from him, and high tail it out of there.

after recounting this story to my roommates, they said i was a total prick about it. they think that since it would have only taken a second to confirm that i paid for the peanut butter, that means i should have just shown him my receipt and been done with it. 

but i think that's bullshit. these stores shouldn't operate on the assumption that i'm a thief by default.

"for offering my sister to pay for an abortion but not offering to support the child finacially if she keeps it?. some side info: my sister has two children (4yo, 2yo) and is married. for the last 2 years the barely made it to the end of the month and all of the family know they struggle finacially. me and my partner are doing well financially and have no kids.

two weeks ago my sister called me and asked me to come visit her, since there was something very important she needed to tell me. when i arrived she immediatly broke down crying, telling me how she was pregnant again and she ""doesn't know what to do"". she didn't even tell her husband at that point and i was very surprised to be the first person to know, since we're not really close.

anyway she continued saying that they don't have the means to support another child with all the debt they already deal with. i tried to calm her as much as i could, saying that there will sure be some solution to handle the situation. after a while she told me she looked up how much abortions cost and that even if she wanted to, she could not pay for it at the time.

so i basically offered that if she decides to abort, i would take care of all medical bills coming from that procedure. she asked me if i could afford that, so i told her she does not have to worry. since i don't use up all my money every month, i'm usually able to put some into savings and it was okay for me to put 2 of my mothly savings into her procedure, if she decides to have it.

she thanked me and told me that she needs time to think about it.

four days later she asked me to come visit again when her husband is home, so we could discuss how to go about it. i drove there at the same evening. they greeted me and her husband told me that he's really happy that i decided to help them in a tough time like that. she told me how she thought about what i said and she wanted to ""accept my offer"". however she didn't want the abortion but suggested that i should give them the money for the abortion as well as ""a little bit very month since i don't spend all my money anyway"". i was pretty much bewildered. i did not offer that. i told them straight forward that i will only give them money for the procedure, but won't be financially supporting them in any other way. her husband blew up, telling me i'm an asshole for ""wanting to pay to kill his child but not supporting them to make it live a good life instead"".

i was overwhelmed by the situation and left immediatly after.

my sister texted me the following days relentlessly about how i don't love her if i don't support her decision and how i'm forcing her into the abortion.

they also told the rest of the family which are also firm to believe i'm a massive asshole in the situation, because i don't need ""all that money to live and i could easily support them"".

"for playing the sexism card as a male. i work in an office where i'm one of the youngest and lowest level employees along with two others. 
being one of the low level staff i get asked to do a lot of admin/odd jobs that aren't anything to do with my job role. 

this has never really bothered me while i was the only one at my my level & being the youngest (22) and hypothetically the fittest, however, a few months ago my work hired two girls my age at my level.

i initially thought great someone to share the load of ""crap jobs"" with so i can focus more on my actual work. boy was i wrong 

whenever it came time to lift a box or screw in a lightbulb i was always the only option,they aren't allowed to lift a finger and my boss justifies it as ""being a gentleman""

which to me seems like bullshit 
i don't expect them to be able to do everything, there are some boxes i can hardly lift but they could at least help with the small ones or the other jobs. 

i'm not the strongest either and coupled with the fact i have never had any manual handling training i have done my back in a few times which would have been easily avoided by sharing the job with someone else. 

so anyway we had our annual staff review this week and i decided to ask what the deal was and whether i could split the work. 

i first said that i felt lower than everyone else and i felt it unfair that i was the only one asked to do these jobs despite there being two others at my level.
my boss couldn't comprehend this.
he said ""you dont expect the girls to do this do you?"" to which i said ""yes and i find it quite sexist""

you might expect my argument to have been that they were being sexist towards women by saying they can't do something, actually i went the other way and said they were being sexist towards me for giving me less favourable and harder jobs for being a male

to an old conservative man in england, any notion being ""p.c"" must be like a slap round the face and he basically laughed me out the door 

i don't really know what i'm gonna do next tbh

this is a relatively small office (30staff) with no hr department, if you have a concern you have to go straight to the boss",3
"for finally snapping at my wife about my drinking?. throwaway account for obvious reasons as my wife uses reddit but not this sub.

i know how that title sounds but please bear with me for a minute.

my wife(32f) and i(33m) have been together for 10 years in october and married for 6 of those years. she comes from a... broken home to say the least. her mother was a drunken alcoholic and her dad was never there, she has one brother and he's a junkie as well. her life growing up was not easy and i will always respect her for rising above all of that and persevering through it all.

now onto my problem. my wife has an issue with *any* substance that can get you high or drunk and understandably so. she made this clear after about 2 years of us dating when she told me about her family. now this i have no issue with, i asked her if me having a few beers socially would be an issue and she said no.

cut to the last few years and her anger to booze has become *much* more apparent. she claims my drinking 2 beers after working a stressful day makes me an alcoholic. now if i was drinking every day she may have a point but i have maybe 3 beers a week at most and *maybe* once a month i may go to my buddy's place and play overwatch and have a few more. i don't get drunk by any stretch at my friend's place but just a good buzz and uber home. i have only ever been legitimately drunk 3 times in our relationship, none of which she was around for and only ever heard second hand. i like to think i'm respectful about it; i keep my beer in the minifridge in the basement, i don't drink in front of her and at her request i don't talk to her at all when i have those few beers on a friday.

i have in the past quit drinking because she asked me to. last time i quit for 2 years just because. quitting is never an issue for me but her badgering me and claiming i'm an alcoholic *all the time* finally caused me to snap at her and tell her that just because her mother was an alcoholic doesn't mean i am. i told her that her extreme hatred for it is causing more issues for me than anything else in my life at this moment. she will literally go from the most sweet person to a completely passive aggresive person in one second when she realizes i bought a 6 pack for the next 2 weeks. the obvious answer is to just quit which would be fine but sometimes i just like to unwind after work you know? i don't get trashed on a regular and i don't let alcohol get in the way of my life so i'm at a loss. if she said ""it's me or the booze"" then i would 100% pick her but my issue is that her problem with alcohol isn't rational and it's not *me* she has an issue with but instead her issues with her mother.

we go out enough and we both hang around with people who drink and she has no issue with them so here i am wondering if i'm an asshole. i feel after a few years of her yelling at me i was justified in getting a bit upset but her friends are calling me an asshole.",3
"for being mad at my parents for ignoring safety tips i told them about visiting my area?. 
my parents are pretty well off, they live in a suburban area where it's pretty expected to ""keep up with the joneses"" and show off with nice cars, spending a lot on a house and on entertaining, designer clothes, etc. but they don't have a lot of savings and that stresses me out.

anyway, i am kind of the opposite. i'm living in an area that's kind of rough right now, driving an old truck, but it's close to my work and it's close to my friends places. i'm saving a lot doing all this. i've paid off my student loans already and i'm saving for a house.

my parents wanted to come visit the city i'm living in, and i said i'd host them at my apartment. but i said to leave the luxury cars behind and take the older sedan that they'd been using as a driving-instruction car for me and my siblings. and i told them to not leave any valuables in the car, instead bring their things inside my apartment. and also, don't bring a large purse or backpack and don't talk to strangers who approach you because they might try and pickpocket you. 

so my parents showed up in their 2018 porche and my mom steps out with a huge designer handbag that doesn't close except for a small snap closure on top. and i'm frustrated they didn't listen but i tell them to come inside, being their things in, and i lend my mom a smaller handbag of mine.

we went out for dinner and when we come back, their car's been broken into. and my dad is freaking out because a bag of his things was stolen. i was frustrated because i'd said to not bring a flashy car and to not leave things in the car... but we go file a police report and that takes up most of the night.

i got snappy at my parents that night for not listening to one of the things i'd said; bringing their flashiest car when i'd said that was a bad idea, etc.

and they got mad at me for having said that they probably won't see their stuff again. 

aita? i didn't mean to make this trip such a mess",3
"for blowing up on a girl i invited to a date when she brought a male friend?. so about a month ago i met a girl in a coffee shop. we talked for a bit, exchanged numbers, and have gotten coffee a couple of times since then and have texted and what not.

my company was offering tickets to game 6 of the caps/hurricanes series in nhl hockey for extremely good value. i have recently gone through a breakup of my girlfriend of five years and i'm really starting to like this girl so i decided to invite her to the game on a date. i tried to make this pretty apparent - it was meant to be a date. she agreed and said hockey is actually one of her favorite sports. at his point i'm super excited.

well i get to her place to pick her up for the game, and she comes out with a male ""friend"". she hops in the backseat with him and i am completely blown away. not sure how to question her, i simply say ""i thought we were the only ones going, i only have two tickets.""

her: ""oh i didn't even think about it. this is my friend \*whatever\*, he wants to go too so i thought i would invite him.""

me: ""that was nice of you, but i still only have two tickets. i can only take two people.""

her: ""you can't find another ticket? i may have to stay home if that's the case.""

at this point i was confused and frankly outraged. she had to have known the tickets were rare and not cheap - even if i got them at a great value. i kind of lost my cool and told them both to get the fuck out of my car - just with a few more words than that.

i sped off and went to the game by myself. it was a fantastic experience, but unfortunately that encounter is literally all i could think about. i still can't believe it happened.

this morning i texted her to lose my number and blocked her. if her intent was to just bring a friend, maybe i was too harsh. that being said, i really wonder if they were actually just friends. maybe she thought we were just friends and it wasn't actually supposed to be a date? just sucks because i really thought she was interested in me - i sure was in her. too good to be true i guess.


info: since some of you asked for additional info regarding how i asked her and what i said specifically.

i started by asking her if she was busy on monday (the night of the game). she said she had nothing planned. i then asked if she was interested in going to the game. my exact words were: ""i can get us tickets at work if you are interested.""

she replied with ""omg yes!"" and thats when she told me she loved hockey. i also suggested dinner but then realized we wouldn't have time before the game so she said we could just get food at the game. sounds like a date to me.

as far as what i said in the car, once she said she would rather stay home than not go with her ""friend"", i said ""alright then. that's kind of shitty of you. guess you're not going, get the fuck out of my car.""

she laughed and they both got out and i went on my way. nothing really more than that.

just a massive kick to the nuts when i spent money on expensive tickets and was very excited to go with this girl just to have her basically make me go alone. it came out of nowhere and at no point in our prior get togethers did she hint that she wasn't interested in me. i mean we had the whole night planned out pretty clearly.

edit: for what it's worth, i'm thinking maybe she just lost interest in me and thought this would be an easy cop out. tip to anyone: if you aren't interested in someone, tell them. had she texted me days before the game and said ""im not going to be able to go, im just not interested. have fun."" i would've said ""well that sucks, but i'm glad she was honest."" i would've found a friend to go with.

but to cop out like she did was brutal and just downright shitty.",3
"for refusing to make my kid apologize?. so my mom has always been some what (okay a lot) of an authoritarian style parent.  there were a lot of time growing up where i didn't agree with her about something but was not allowed to voice that. and honestly even now, there are some of those times.

i love my mom, she's the strongest person i ever met.  but because of this i have never shared much of my personal life with her.  i try to open up more now, because i want an open relationship with her.  and, to her credit she has tried a lot harder to be less strict but she's still her own way.

well because of this i have made it a point to involve my son in our lives as much as makes since given his age etc.  he has always been given a voice.

okay so let's get the background over... i'm a single mother to a 5 year old boy with several allergies. some severe and some mild.  including an array of food allergies. my mother babysits him while i am at work.  this generally means she is feeding him about one meal a week by my request, and sometimes he gets junk or treats there too.

well recently my mom was feeding him and the other kids (cousins) some dinner which happened to be cooked with an ingredient my son is allergic to.  it's complicated to explain the nature of that particular allergy but while he will likely not die from it, he is still usually caused a bit of discomfort when he eats it.  hives, itchy mouth, etc.  typically if it is cooked and he gets some, it's okay. but he has reacted to cooked too. so even though his epipen isn't for that specific food, we avoid it.  basically he *can* eat it and not die but really shouldn't and he and i have decided together he won't. 

well mom told him he had to eat his dinner or he was going to be in big trouble.  when he said no again she told him he was grounded from
screens all night until he cleaned his plate.  my son's reply was ""fine. i don't care how much trouble i'm in i am not eating that.  you can't make me.""

well of course my mom was livid when i got there to get him.  and she had told me he has to apologize before he can come back.

i told her that i can't make him do that. i have taught him from day 1 that he can refuse to eat any food he's allergic to. no adult can make him poison himself. and i will 100% back that up.  

now mom is saying we are both ah's and need to apologize to her.  that she knows which foods he is deathly allergic to and which ones are ""fine as long as he has antihistamines if he gets hives."" 

so, aita? and was my son holey-jr?

"for banning everyone who critiques our parenting from meeting our son?. my wife has minor anxiety and ocd. she has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. none of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. it was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. she had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn't want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn't. i talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn't want to do it.

after the delivery, i was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. a lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. my wife said she wasn't going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. she said she just kept saying ""i don't want to,"" but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. i came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.

things got considerably better when we left the hospital. my wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. this was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.

the conflict comes in because i told my dad he couldn't be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. i've also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. a number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we're using and so on. i stopped sending photos, but my wife and i talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.

so i told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can't come meet the baby. they probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and as a mom, but until then, no one can come. thus far, the only people who have met my son are my wife's parents, her sister, and my mom.

a lot of my family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are just trying to help. my mom told me i should give them a chance, but i think the risk is too big. am i the asshole for banning them?",3
"for telling my parents they won't be invited to my wedding?.. my fiance and i have been dealing with a conflict with my parents for just over a year now. 


my fiance is on the autism spectrum, so sometimes has difficulty with social etiquette, relationships, body language etc. 

my family has been aware of this for years, even before we started dating. 

they take a lot of issue with him, even back when we were in high school. him and my dad argued about the name of a restaurant and my dad called him an arrogant asshole for insisting he was wrong. 

more recently, an incident occurs where my fiance tries to have a discussion with my parents about a book that his mom (who is a parenting author) just released. my dad felt offended by this and thought that my fiance meant they were no good at parenting. he went on to yell at the both of us, swearing and calling my fiance names including ""retard"" (which he took offense to given his diagnosis. my father knows this)

they both sort of didn't address it again but we asked for an apology. we did not receive it. rather, we got several texts that were aggressive in nature from my dad, and guilt-trippy messages from my mom to just move on from it. 

a few weeks ago, my sister made a post on social media holding her friend's baby. my fiance commented jokingly ""is it yours"". now, i know it was a joke and sometimes he doesn't understand that jokes can have ""wrong"" audiences and jokes can be badly timed. my parents didn't give him that grace and sent us messages about how his behaviour seems to be reckless and potentially dangerous and the comment was shameful. my mom's message said they did not give their blessing for my engagement. my father's text said the same thing but also included ""are you really trying to tell me that boy/man with all his mental deficiencies is really good for your life??? that's a tough sell my dear."" 

i chose not to respond because i felt like it was aggressive.

today i sent a message to my mother to convey my thoughts and make some things clear to her. in it i said that if they didn't give their blessing, they shouldn't expect an invitation to our wedding. 

in some ways i feel unsure about this. my sister recently told me that i'm being disrespectful to them and i should be grateful that they gave me a great life.

i know the whole saying ""family is family"" but i can't help but wonder, where's the line? when is it ok to say no, you won't put up with it anymore? 

for saying they won't be invited?.",3
"for not wanting my husband's best friend over every week.. my husband and i just got into (another) fight because his best friend who comes over every wednesday is (again) staying the night. 

my husband and this friend have had a wednesday night ""date"" where the guy comes over to our house to ""jam"" every week for the last two years, and i'm getting to the point that i want to hit the guy over the head with whatever is closest at hand every time he is around. 

buckle up. this is probably going to be a long one.... if you make it through all of this you are my hero. 

at first he was supposed to come over just for a few hours on wednesday nights to play guitar with my husband while i was at work. over time i have stopped working late wednesday's but the jam session continues. which was fine. however, for the last year they have barely touched the guitars and instead the guy just comes over to get high (on pot). neither my husband or i get high with him (i don't enjoy pot and my husband isn't much into it either, but we aren't morally against it so we didn't say anything early on when we should have). 

now that he is always high here, he never leaves at the end of the night. just expects to sleep over. but he doesn't have a regular sleep schedule so instead of sleeping while we are, he is wandering around our house all night (in his boxers) making noises, watching tv, getting nonstop text alerts from other friends and ect. this always wakes me up and i have to pass by him on the way to the bathroom. at these points he always has demands. like: ""i want to watch this random movie your husband said you had. find it for me."" or ""you need to change your litter box right now, because your cat just pooped and i can't stand the smell."" he always says he'll leave when my husband goes for work at 8am, but then complains that he couldn't sleep until 6am, so he ends up sleeping until mid day. at which point he just decides to stay until my husband gets home from work and then the whole thing starts over again. what's supposed to be one night a week often turns into at least two every week. 

on top of never leaving, he has started showing up hours before my husband gets off work on wednesday's. my husband has told him ""my home is your home"" so he just comes right in. this wouldn't be a problem if he could self entertain. but no. he comes in and will just walk into our bedroom (where i'm hiding) sit down on the bed, take a hit of his shit, and start talking to me through whatever i'm doing/watching on tv. 

every time he is here he eats a lot of our food (gets the munchies, plus regular meals) but never once has had the courtesy to bring anything of his own, or to share, or to replace what he is eating here. he just goes into our fridge and pantry and eats whatever he wants because my husband told him our home was his. 

my husband is always begging me to be nice and not say anything while he is here because he is lonely and needs friends.... except he has his other best friend living with him, and is constantly going on weekend trips all over the country to visit his other friends.  not to mention those nonstop text message alerts all night. 

dealing with this guy is like hanging out with a 17 year old stoner non stop. he farts and burps as loud as possible wherever. whenever. is demanding and needy, but completely rude at the same time. saying things like ""dude! you actually made your house look sorta nice this week."" (as i was prepping for christmas), and ""so you do sometimes make an effort on your looks"" (when i had gone somewhere nice and come home with makeup on). he also complains non stop about the food i make (yet eats it all anyway). 

this year for my birthday we couldn't afford to get any gifts, so i asked my husband instead to line up his days off so we could spend four days just us together...... then this guy broke up with his girlfriend and my husband begged me to let him come over just for a bit on the first evening. que two full weeks of him not going home, and demanding all of my husband's time. i spent ""our time"" and my birthday, holed up in our room alone. 

then, christmas comes. i had invited my whole family to our house and tried to make things extra special because it was the first time i got to see my parents on christmas in more than ten years. this guy's mom had just moved to another state but this guy has plenty of money and no job to work around so he could have easily made the trip to her for christmas. but he didn't. then his other friend/housemate also went out of town and he threw a ""woe is me, i'm all alone one christmas eve, no one loves me"" tantrum until my husband invited him to our house. he shows up. gets high. and is a complete ass to everyone. then throws a fit when he decides to sleep over because he has to sleep on the couch in a sleeping bag (my family were in the other beds.) the next morning we sit down to breakfast and he lets out this huge stinky fart right at the table like it's nothing, then proceeds to dish himself up 90% of the food and just generally be a douche. my family was flat out disgusted by him and his behavior and couldn't wait to leave. he stayed for three days. 

i feel like an ass hole because he is my husband's best friend and i don't want to make them not hang out, and honestly he hasn't done anything truly terrible. he's just annoying as shit. i fucking dread every wednesday, and then i'm super irritated the whole time he's here. which i hide from him, at my husband's request, but then my husband and i always end up fighting over him not leaving at the end of the night. 

i'm honestly one or two wednesday's away from homicide with this guy, and all this i've told you is just the tip of the iceberg. 

if you've made it this far, please tell me for being upset at my husband for letting this guy stay over again tonight, and wanting a substantial break from his best friend? 



tl;dr my husband's best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. for not wanting him to come over for a long time? 








thank you all for your overwhelming response!! i haven't been able to reply to all of you, but i want you to know i've read every post and i appreciate all of your opinions (even the ones calling me a shrew) and your great advice! 

some clarification and an update: in case you weren't already sick of reading all this >< 


clarification 1: as some have pointed out, there isn't much of an action here for me to ask about. i'm sorry i didn't make it clearer originally. the question is am i unreasonable and being an ass hole for wanting a break from having this friend over. my husband and i fought over this last night and he feels i'm being overly upset and needlessly irritable at said friend. you've already read how i feel about it. 


clarification 2: this post, admittedly doesn't give much positive about the friend. his friend has been in my husband's life since he was in grade school, and while the friend is over they do actively chat, watch movies, and generally hang out while i actively hide and feel irritated. all this stuff for sure could look like an exaggeration if it all happened in the last few days, but this is sorta my laundry list of the last two years of grievances which have been building up over time. on a regular wednesday he is just stoned, flatulent, and childish, which while annoying, isn't really actively douchy. he has done some very nice things for my husband, such as paying to take him to some very expensive concerts so that they could both nerd out over their favorite guitar players live. i -clearly- don't like the guy, but my husband gets a lot of enjoyment out of their friendship and i'm not saying that has to stop. just that -i- need a break. also, my husband does have other friends, they just have lives so he only gets to hang out once every few months with them. he is also in a band with other friends whom he sees regularly every monday night. 

clarification 3: my husband doesn't see a problem with how he speaks to me because according to him ""the guy just has poor social skills, that comment about your makeup was a compliment.""

clarification 4: he smokes a vape style pot pen, not a physical bud, which has less residual scent and is why my husband told him he could do it in the house. before he started using i was ok with him. he still had poor manners, but he wasn't nearly as bad as he is now, and he never spent the night (or longer). back before the pot i even enjoyed hanging out with the two of them every so often. oh and i know my husband occasionally also imbibes with him, which isn't something that makes me mad. he doesn't go overboard like his friend. 

update: when i woke up this morning i noticed that my phone was buzzing…. and buzzing…. and buzzing…. as all these awesome comments kept pouring in. i have never really had much success on reddit, so when i looked and saw how many comments there were i said ""oh my god!"" of course my husband asked what was wrong and i said ""i told the internet the story of ***** and asked if i was the ass hole for what we fought over last night."" he said..""oh"" and that was it. but then on his way out of the bedroom he said ""i'm going to get him up"", and by the time i was dressed and out of the room they guy was out of the house and driving away. hallelujah!!! 

forty minutes later when he got to work i received a text message telling me how i was his best friend and that he loves me more than the world ect. then we texted back and forth and he said ""i really feel like we both contribute to it. i feel like you are overly grumpy on things pertaining to *****. but at the same time, i invite him to come up extra days, or stay the night without running it by you. i feel we could both do better and relieve a lot of stress and frustration. do you agree?""  

he then called a few minutes later and i told him that i know i'm grumpy but i feel like it's reasonably so. i also told him i didn't want to force them not to be friends just that -i- needed a break from the friend. then i gave him some possible solutions such as hanging out at his house every other week, or have a set time that the guy needs to stop smoking in order to drive home later (thanks guys! great suggestions!) and he agreed to consider other arrangements with the hang out time so that i could have some time away from the friend, and we agreed to talk more about it when he is off work tonight. although i can tell he still isn't seeing a problem other than my attitude : / 

again thank you to everyone who has commented! 







tl;dr my husband's best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. for not wanting him to come over for a long time?

"for mocking a friend who fakes their accent?. i (18m) have a really close friend (18f) who has recently started faking a british accent, it's so clear to everyone that it's fake. honestly it makes it hard for me to do anything w/ her because people notice right away. parties? fake accent. class? fake accent. talking with friends? fake accent, everyone can tell it's fake, and they always question when she started faking her accent or question if it's actually real.

the final straw was when i invited her over for dinner w/ my parents and she tried using it on them. they instantly noticed and looked at her and then me. it was so embarrassing and the rest of the dinner was them asking when she started using a fake accent, and her pretending to be oblivious ""*whut are yew tawlking abowt?*"".

i have been trying to ignore her, but my parents and her parents are really close, and they've helped us financially when we have been unstable, so they told me to suck it up.

for christmas when josh was 15, he came to visit me, my wife and his brother. it was then he had came out to me as gay – and i did not react the way i should have. at that point in my life, i had found christianity and it was tethered to keeping me sober – and unfortunately i bought into a lot of the anti-gay sentiments my local church used to preach. i don't visit that church anymore. for about two years we cut contact but i came to realization that i was wrong and i begged my son for forgiveness. he forgave me and we tried to regain the father/son relationship, although the distance being a few hours away didn't help. we still would only see each other a couple times a year.

my son is now 21 and for this last father's day, he surprised his step dad with a legal name change, changing his last name to match his step father's. when i heard this, my feelings were crushed. he had not even contacted me for father's day. i knew that he and his step dad were close but i didn't think he would ever change his name. the next time i saw him, i asked him about it – why he didn't at least give me a heads up. he told me that while he does forgive me for my past actions; he does not see me as a father figure and that his step father was always there for him. when i mentioned that he now didn't have the same last name as his brother, he said he didn't really care about that as he and his brother admittedly are not close.

i was crushed and angry. i contacted my ex and told he how upset i was with this and how i would have appreciated a heads up from her. she said she had nothing to do with his decision and that he came to her having already decided to change his name. i feel really bitter and resentful; i don't even know where my relationship with my son will go from here now. i know i wasn't the best father but i don't know if i really deserve this? i feel like i should have had a heads up he was changing his name, instead of hearing about it after the fact. here?

&#x200b;

**edit**: reading the replies has really opened my eyes. my anger and resentment is misplaced and is coming from a place of complete guilt. i'm not angry or resentful of my son, i'm angry at myself for my past actions but my ego is making it feel otherwise. i'm currently writing a letter to my son's step father thanking him for being there for my son. i'm also going to apologize to my ex for blaming her for this because that was not right. i never brought any of this up to my son - after he gave me his explanation i stayed quiet. i know i've been a terrible father for most of his life - i hope even if he doesn't see me as a father figure, we can have a good relationship as an adult. he is a very thoughtful and forgiving person and i'm lucky he has given me multiple chances after many many screw-ups to still be apart of his life. i'm not going to mess it up again. thank you, reddit.",3
"if i refuse to add my stepdaughter as a recipient to a trust fund which i and my late wife set up for my daughter?. daughter and sd are 14&15 respectively. wife and i have been married for 10 years. 

so my late wife( she died fighting cancer )and i invested our money and decided to set up something like a trust fund for our daughter. most of what my late wife inherited from her parents also went to this fund. all of this money is supposed to go to my daughter provided she meets some requirements. 

on the other hand, my wife and her ex husband have nothing saved up for my stepdaughter. she asked me if i would add my sd as a recipient because the sum is quite large. i told her that my late wife contributed a lot to the fund and she wanted it to go to my daughter. she's upset because i'm being biased now. i think this is something which was planned a long time ago, even before i met my current wife. also, it was something my late wife put a lot of effort into. here?

"for getting my coworker's $2,000 vacation taken away?. some background, my little sister is in the army. i haven't seen her since august for a funeral. she hasn't really been able to take leave because she was flagged for her weight. finally, she tells me in early december that she got approved to go on leave at the end of january, so i immediately went and put in for my vacation time at work. i haven't stopped talking about it and made everyone aware that i was taking this time to see my sister.

my job has a super strict first come, first served policy about taking vacations. my department only has 8 people and it's considered a trade so you can't just pull anyone off the street to cover for one of us, so only one person is allowed to take vacation at a time.

this past week, one of my coworkers asks off for the *exact same* week as me, saying he already spent $2,000 to go out of the country and our bosses ""better approve the time off because of how expensive it was."" our boss sees the request and pulls him aside telling him that he can't have it because i asked for it. coworker cries to the big boss and big boss gives it to him, telling my boss to tell me to take my vacation ""some other time."" i went to the big boss explaining the situation, he didn't do anything, so i went over his head. the dm was appalled and basically took away my coworker's vacation, wrote my store manager for breaking policy and told my coworker if he calls in more than once that week to go on said vacation, he'll get fired. 

i didn't mean to get everyone in trouble, but i asked for it over a month ago and i want to see my sister. am i the asshole here? ",3
"for being open about my economic status among pushy coworkers?. i work at a small tech company where it's basically split between designers and project managers. i'm the admin assistant, so i do a little bit of everything until we find out what i'm good at. the others in the company come from much different experiences and life backgrounds than me. on the pm side, it's mostly women, and they love to talk about all the things they buy, travel, etc. 

one of them pulled me into a conversation about travel and said we should all bring in passports to compare places we've been. i said ""oh, i've never had a passport."" she was shocked, asked me why not. i just said ""oh, i can't really afford to travel."" she looked confused and asked about when i was growing up, where would we go on family vacations. i said we didn't and changed the subject. she kept looking at me weird after that.

then came the purse thing. i've carried the same bag with me for about 6 years. one of the girls laughed at a fraying strap and said it was time for a new one, and suggested this brand i'd never heard of that kind of matched the style. i looked it up and said ""that's a really nice one! but wow, $150 for a purse!"" she looked at me funny and said ""do you think that's a lot...?"" i said yes, that's basically two weeks groceries for me. she was very taken aback.

the ""inciting"" incident happened last week. one of the women recently started the process of buying a house. she's really excited and got her a nice candle. one of the women said that i was next, and i just said ""haha, yeah right!"" one of the women asked when i thought i'd start looking, and i was honest and said that i don't really see home ownership as a part of my life. they were all shocked and kept trying to tell me why i was wrong, and i admit i got a little annoyed when they wouldn't drop it. i said ""with what money?""

it got awkward after that, and the next day one of the women pulled me aside and told me that they're sick of the way i always have to be a downer about money, and that i always make it awkward when i talk about what i can't afford. i said ""well, how do you think it makes me feel to have you guys constantly flaunting all the purses and high end makeup and designer clothes you're wearing."" she said that they were bonding, that's what women do, and that from now on, i should try to be more discrete about the income disparity between us. 

i said ""sure, if you guys will be, so will i."" she gave me a look and said that i'm acting kind of like an asshole and punishing them for something that's not their fault. i told her that she was certainly entitled to that opinion, but that i think it's tacky to brag about all of the lavish things you can buy. she got pretty upset at that and now just one of the pm girls talks to me. aita?",3
"for wanting to forgive one brother for having an affair with another brother's fiance?. let me just start off and say i think cheating is deplorable.

i have two brothers, john (28) and matt (25).

around three years ago, our family exploded when it came out that matt was having an affair with john's fiance. a fiance who was 6 months pregnant. matt turned out to be the father.

john was understandably humiliated and angry. i was fully on his side.  i was disgusted with matt and the fiance.

here's my issue though. at john's insistence, matt has pretty much been excommunicated from our family. he isn't allowed at any gatherings where john is. and john purposely makes sure he is at every one. 

matt married john's ex-fiance and are raising the 2.5 year old together.

to this day, matt's wife is referred to as a whore and the baby is called a bastard. only by john but in our family's presence. he hates them with a passion even today.

my parents have really struggled with this but have agreed to follow john's rule of no contact with the wife or baby. even contact with matt is done in secret.

matt has been kicked out of our family business because john can't be in the same room as him. all photos of matt have been hidden in the family home. no gifts have been given to matt's child at all.

am i absolutely crazy to think that three years of this is enough? 

matt is clearly remorseful and has apologized many times in tears. he clearly regrets hurting our brother.

i can understand that john is absolutely hurt and it must've been the most painful betrayal.

but i still love both my brothers. matt did a shitty thing but how much more does he need to be punished?

my poor parents have been broken hearted for the past three years because of this. they have confided in me that they are willing to forgive matt and move on and regret letting it get this far. we were such a tight knit family before.

but i'm really worried that suggesting forgiveness with john will cause a massive fight and he'll make us choose between them. i also worry about his mental health.

there also the innocent child in this. he deserves a relationship with his grandparents and his aunt.

i have recently been visiting matt and his family. they are clearly struggling with the isolation. his wife broke down and apologized as i held my nephew for the first time. my heart tore in two.

for wanting to bring them into our family again and forgiving them? there is family reunion coming up in a week and i want them to attend.",3
"for making my children wash their clothes in the bathtub with dollar store detergent?. my kids are aged 14 m and 15 f. the other day my son asked if i could wash his favorite shirt for some event coming up, so i told him i would and to put it in the hamper. later that day i found it just sitting on the floor so i didn't bother. same thing with my daughter, she asked me to wash something (don't remember what) and she got the same response. same thing happened with the piece of clothing on the floor instead of the hamper so i didn't bother

later in the evening they started bitching about the clothes they requested not being washed and i told them ""all you had to do was put it in the hamper"" to which my son said ""yeah but it was near the hamper you can just pick it up"" to which my daughter agreed. i didn't say anything more about the issue

the next morning i went to the dollar store and bought some laundry detergent. when my kids came down for breakfast it was sitting on the table, and they asked what it was. i informed them that until they stop being entitled spoiled brats that they can wash their own clothes, but not with my washing machine. i informed them they will be washing all their clothes from now on in the bath tub with dollar store detergent until they start being respectful and i receive an apology for the remarks about picking up their crap near the hamper and once the detergent runs out they have to use their own money to buy more but they're only allowed to buy it at the dollar store. then came more whining and bitching 

it's been a week and they still haven't apologized and i'm saving time, money and water on only washing mine and my husband's clothes. my husband said i'm being ""harsh"" but i don't think so. so am i the asshole for teaching my kids a lesson?",3
"for keeping my father's love child a secret?. about 22 years ago my dad had an affair and got his mistress pregnant. he confessed all to my mom who responded ""take care of your responsibility but i never want to hear about this again."" so my dad did just that- he paid child support and had a relationship with my brother but spoke of it to no one except his attorney, his mother, and sister. he claims  a lapse in judgement and has been faithful and committed to my mom since.

5 years ago i ran into my aunt and nana having lunch with a teenage boy. they seemed uneasy but asked if i wanted to join them and i really hit it off with nicholas. he was cool as shit and we had a lot in common even though i was 22 and he was 16. i asked my nana  how they knew him and she brushed me off. later that day my dad asked me to meet up and told me that nicky was my half brother and the whole story. all these years that we thought my dad was working, out of town on business or on a guy's trip he was usually with nicky. at first i was really angry but then i felt really bad for him and nicky and told him i wanted to have relationship with my brother. he said ok and seemed happy about it but asked that i not tell my siblings or let my mom know because it would devastate her. i played along for a few years. i was at nicky's graduation, took him on his senior trip  backpacking in europe, and helped him move into his college dorm. we're as close as if we grew up together.

i recently got engaged and in planning the wedding decided i wanted nicky as a groomsmen with my other brothers. i told my dad and he agreed it was time to end the charade and my mom would have to face it. so he told my mom and my mom called me and begged me not to let the family secret out and how that was a hard time for her and she can't face my father's son. i felt bad but i think that my brother is also innocent in this and that my mom needs to be an adult and face reality. so we told my siblings. there have been a lot of emotions over the past few months but my siblings  love nicky and he's really happy to have brothers and sisters and fits right in. my dad seems relieved to have all his kids together and not to be keeping a secret. my mom spent the entire summer at our beach house and still seems to be in denial.

her sister (my aunt) says i'm an asshole bc i should've stayed out of it. 2 of my 4 siblings think i'm an asshole for keeping the secret for so long. they think its unfair that i got to make so many memories with nicky and they didn't get to. one of them is around nicky's age and is really bummed she didn't know she had a brother so closer to her age. i think they have lots of time to make memories with him now and that i was in a tough place and made a hard decision but that doesn't make me an asshole.

&#x200b;

just a few edits to clarify some things:

1. my dad hasn't been going behind my mom's back to see nicky. when i spoke to my mom, she indicated that she knew that my dad had a relationship with him and my dad said that he told her during the ""i don't want to hear about it talk"" that he told her that he couldn't just throw money at the child but not be involved and my mom said she knew he couldn't. while he never said ""i'm going to nicky's soccer game tonight and won't be home for dinner"" my mom told me sister during a talk a couple months ago that she almost always knew when my dad was with nicky. 
2. my wedding isn't until next year (next october) and if my mom still hasn't dealt with the situation and feels that she can be part of the day, then we will push it back a little more if we need to. my so fully supports me in this. i wanted the secret to come out now so that we weren't dealing with it right before the wedding and nicky wasn't being introduced as our brother at the wedding. that's a total asshole move and never occured to me to do 
3. there have been a lot of comments about me not loving my mom and being callous towards her. this was not my intention. i love my mom. she is wonderful and loving and i don't want to cause her any pain but i also do think that my parents made the wrong decision 22 years ago to keep nicky a secret and that she's had 22 years to come to terms with his existence. no one sees her as someone to pity. if anything, everyone's respect for my dad has gone down a few notches for being unfaithful, however, my mom had/has a chance to act with grace and compassion and i think that is what most people will see: my dad is the louse and my mom is the saint for staying with him, forgiving him, and being tolerant of nicky. 
4. i know i talked a lot about my dad being happy and some negative comments made about that. my dad is not overjoyed that my mom is hurting but he is relieved to not be living two lives anymore. despite his infidelity, he is an upstanding guy and it bothered him to continue lying to his children and he hated sneaking around. 
5. yes, my sister was 3 months old when my dad confessed the affair. the affair lasted about 6 months and began around a time when my parents were living apart and continued for a couple months after they reunited (they reunited right before my sister was born). their separation had nothing to do with infidelity or lying.
6. my mother has not been alone at the beach house. my dad has been with her a lot of the time and each of us siblings has visited her. she's also had friends staying with her. 

also, just because i don't want people to think that my parents have a bad marriage that my mom has suffered through all these years for us kids-they don't. they are loving and affectionate. my dad adores my mother and she adores him. she has told us that she stayed with my dad then because she loves him and that the affair was out of character for him and she didn't believe he would do it again. she does not want a divorce and everyone really is trying to help her through it as much as possible.",3
"for not allowing my son to come back to my house after he called his mom to come get him?. my ex-wife and i divorced almost two years ago and don't co-parent great-mostly just try to ignore one another unless necessary for us to interact (not mature, i know, but my attempts to change that were not met kindly). we have three children together and the youngest, evan (8), has been struggling the most with the divorce. the past few months he's been having meltdowns when he doesn't get his way- if we go to a restaurant he likes but that one of his brothers picked, or if he is made to clean his room instead of playing video games. he will yell that we're all mean, he doesn't like us and call his mom to come get him. she does, and then an hour or so later he gets dropped back off. i've asked her to not come get him, that it's my parenting time and he has to learn that he can't run away whenever he doesn't get his way, but she basically told me to f- off.

so i picked the kids up friday and told evan that if he called his mom to come get him that he had to stay with her all weekend and i would see him again the next day i had custody (i have him two days a week and three weekends a month). he got mad saturday morning over multiple things and called his mom to come get him. when she showed up, i reiterated the new rule to him and told her that if she took him she was keeping him all weekend. she basically blew me off and they left. a couple hours later when i was out with the other two, she called to see where i was because evan had cooled down and was ready to come back and she had ""things to do."" i reminded her that i told both of them if he left that he was with her all weekend. she blew up my phone all day angry because she had plans and couldn't find a sitter, evan called upset a couple times but i held my ground. he called sunday and was apologetic and asked if he could come to church with us and i told him yes and kept him the rest of the day and he was much better behaved. my ex says i am an asshole, which i'm used to, but then when i told my mom and sister, they also said i was too harsh and should've let him come back saturday and i find a different way to handle the behavior issues. i was feeling pretty proud of myself until i talked to them. should i drop this new rule or just ignore their opinion?

&#x200b;

update: wow, thanks for all the responses. i got a lot of really good advise and things to think about. i have made an appointment with my attorney to discuss getting evan into therapy that she can not interfere with and also to find out my best course of action for when/if she shows up in the future. wanted to jump on and answer a couple questions, though. a lot of people asked how evan was contacting his mom- she got him a phone for christmas. he is not supposed to bring it to my house bc i once took it away when he and his brothers were bickering all day (they all go their phones taken away). evan told his mom and she told me i had no right to take his phone away since she paid for it. so i told her that the phone stays at her house when he is with me but half the time he hides it and i don't know he has it. he will also call/text her by getting one of his brother's phones. once he even went in my office and facetimed her on my ipad. i usually don't know he's doing this because the things he decides he is going to call her about are random and often benign. once, he called her because he didn't want to go to lowes. he whined about going, i told him he couldn't stay home by  himself so he had to go and proceeded to finish cleaning up the kitchen. less than 10 minutes later and his mom is at the door to get him. he hadn't thrown a tantrum or anything-just normal whining that my other boys did at that age. later that afternoon when all the boring errands were done and i was about to take the older boys to a movie he got dropped back off. mostly when he calls her he is not emotional and crying- he just isn't getting his way and is frustrated. the older two got the same way at his age (heck they get frustrated now if they are told no) but they didn't have the option at his age to have someone come get them so they go their way.",3
"aita for photoshopping a picture of my girlfriend.. so about a month ago i was talking to guy in work. hes a pretty fit guy like myself and we were talking about gym routines. 

id seem a picture of him on facebook and he has almost perfect physic and i was asking his secrets. 

he explained to me that it wasnt all him and showed me an app on his phone that he used to edit his pictures and give him that extra boost. the app was free so i downloaded it. 

it was pretty good and i showed my gf the pics and she thought they we pretty good too. over the coming weeks i got a bit obsessed about editing pics of myself and then got bored with it, never shared a picture with anyone other then her and the guy in work. one day i was again  bored watching some program i eith the gf so started to play with it again. edited myself, the cat and a few pictures of my gf. 

even though she is also in good shape ( we gym or so oyher activity ever other day) i gave her a flatter stomach, pinched waste and bigger boobs. after a while id thought i'd done a good job and showed it to her, she was not impressed at all asked why id done it. i explained i was bored with the tv programme and wonder what she would look like with bigger boobs. 

she got  annoyed tunned of the programme and went upstairs to watch it. 

am i the arsehole?

fristly i think my girlfriend is beautiful. this wasnt for me wanting to change her. i also did other pictures like long arms and making my cat super fat.

"for demolishing a public park?. i bought some land including a house on a corner lot across from a school. there's a ""public"" park on the property which i also inherited. as far as i'm aware, this park has been open to the public for a couple of decades. i'm not super familiar as i'm relatively new to this town. it's one of three parks and obviously it's heavily used due to the closeness of an elementary school.

my lawyer says it's an ""easement"" meaning the public is free to use it out of habit/tradition yet it remains my responsibility. i guess the prior owner maintained it with some help from the town through the mayor's office and volunteers. the prior owner was a developer/philanthropist who did a lot of the small town.

i don't like this because it opens me up to liability. i've asked the mayor's office if they'd like to hire surveyors to redraw property lines and consider it public property rather than my property, for free no less, and they've refused. they don't want the liability or the cost of hiring workers and lawyers to make it happen.

putting up signage or fences haven't really worked so i want to uproot it all and just make it lawn. before this, when i had signage up, some of the parents of students at the school started a petition to ""save their park"", not knowing it's privately owned and not part of the town's public spaces. trying to reason with some of them fell on deaf ears.

would i be the asshole? still working it out legally with my lawyer else i'd have posted this on /r/legaladvice. i'm looking for moral/ethical opinions on whether i should or not. i just don't want a kid to get hurt, parents go to the mayor, mayor sends them to me.",3
"if i tell my trans sister that her interpretation of womanhood is misogynistic and really irritating?. to start this off, i love my sister. i support her 100%. 
when she told me she is trans i got behind it immediately. i referred to her with the correct pronouns privately and used her chosen name for a full year before she came out. i fought for her when members of our family rejected her and i would and have immediately cut anyone off if they are in any way hateful towards her. 

when she came out she was embraced by many but rejected were loudly by enough people for it to be absolutely devastating. as a result we became very close and spend much more time together than we did before. 

now, for the shitty part. ever since she came out she's been getting progressively more annoying. she fakes stupidity, like will actually put on a 2000's style paris hilton ditzy act. she's taken up cattiness that she never ever had in her before and just recently i caught her pretending not to know how to put windshield wiper fluid in her car. like, she actually created this whole scene where she was confused and needed help doing a task i know she can do because she taught me to do it when i got my license!

a cousin eventually said something to her which resulted in a lot of tears and her calling that cousin transphobic (i know he's not but he did come on really strong telling her that she was being fucking annoying) so i know that i have to tread very carefully.

now i'm wondering if this is just kind of like her going through the same self discovery i went through as a teenager and it will pass? i don't know if me breaking down for her how her new found identity is irritating as shit is any help if this is something she grows out of herself. i honestly don't know what to do.",3
"for refusing to donate my hair to my aunt with cancer?. for context, i'm adopted and have super long & very thick red hair. no one in my adopted family has hair like mine,and it's been kind of a thing for them to touch, admire, & talk about my hair at family gatherings since i was a kid. my aunt has lung cancer, and it's really taken a toll on her. she's lost all her hair and has talked about getting a wig, but they're too expensive and she says she wants real hair. my mom suggested i donate my hair to make a wig for my aunt at easter dinner, and my aunt got so excited she started crying. i felt horrible about it, and didn't say anything. we went to this wig place and the lady said she could make a shoulder length wig for my aunt using my hair. (i keep it up extremely well & it's down to my knees) my aunt started crying again and again i feel so awful, but i really don't want to part with my hair. i know it grows back but still.

no one had asked me how i felt, but i think my mom could tell i wasn't very excited about it because she asked the lady if she could donate her own hair, and she said she'd need both my sister (mom's biological daughter) and my mom to donate their hair, since it's very thin, and she could only make a chin length wig with it. my aunt also wants red hair, so the lady said she'd have to dye it & that would cause it damage & cost more than using my hair. my uncle then said it'd make much more sense to use mine.

it's been a month and my aunt wants to know when we can make the appointment. i don't know what to do. i told my sister and she called me ungrateful and told me to stop being selfish because it would grow back. if i'm ta i won't hesitate to donate it but i don't know anymore.

edit: people suggested i clarify, i have knee length hair & i'd have to cut all of it off to the scalp in order to make the wig.

to all the people saying it doesn't take that much hair to make a wig: it does. one average donation of hair doesn't make a full wig, they match it with other donations. it usually takes 2-3 heads of hair for a full wig. mine is long enough on its' own for a full wig, and my aunt doesn't want synthetic hair mixed in to supplement it.
i completely understand everyone that said i was the asshole for not saying no in the beginning. i'm not trying to justify that, but i want to make it clear that it's extremely difficult for me to stand up to my family. i don't think i've ever had a say in anything since i started living with them, and that's how it's always been. they never give me a voice, even though i should have spoken up. it always goes without saying that what my mom says will happen.",3
"for not wanting to adopt my sister's kids?. before i start, i would respectfully ask you to consider the fact that i am still mourning and not speak ill about my sister.

because i am the closest family (one of our parents in jail, the other dead) i was expected to take guardianship. i dont want them to have any more trauma than they do already but i had never wanted kids. i am not good with nor like kids. 

my cousin, who has kids of his own, proposed to take the guardianship instead (his wife is in board). i support that. that would give them both a father figure, other kids to play with, loving family.

backstory: my husband and i have two kids (both teenagers). we raised our children to be christian (as is our faith), but also didn't want to force them into our religion so as soon as they turned 13 they were allowed to no longer come to church, participate in saying grace before meals, etc.. one of our kids has continued with church and their faith very adamantly. our other kid has come to church more sporadically and over the past half year or so has began to explore buddhism. more recently they have been telling us that they are no longer christian, but they are buddhists. while we are disappointed that they are no longer christian, i  believe everyone is entitled to their own religion and i am proud that my daughter is exploring her faith. 

current issue: at dinner recently we were talking about travel plans for christmas (we usually will rent a cabin somewhere for family time) and i mentioned that i wasn't planning to get our non-christian daughter any big gifts since her religion doesn't celebrate christmas. she was immediately upset. i told her that i would get her some little goodies so she didn't feel too left out, but that she shouldn't expect to partake in a religious holiday for a religion she doesn't believe in. she said (i'm so many words) it's not fair for us to spend money on our other child's gifts, but not her and that we were punishing her for not being christian. it doesn't make sense to me to give her gifts to celebrate the birth of jesus when she doesn't believe he is our savior. i told her if she really felt it were unfair, i would donate the amount of money i spent on our other kid to a charity of her choice in her name. she didn't like this either. my husband and i have since talked and he has very mixed feelings on the whole situation. 

aita?

edited to add: not sure if this matters, but i have made it clear to her that if she ever wanted to celebrate any holidays pertaining to her religion i would do my best and get her what she needs to celebrate. my goal is not to hinder her exploration of buddhism.

edited to add: i see a lot of comments about how christmas isn't a christian holiday and i agree that many families celebrate a very commercialized christmas. we (for example) do not involve santa in our celebration, but we do (for example) read from the bible and sing hymns. regardless of what others do, our family takes the holiday as an opportunity to celebrate and thank god for all that he has done and provided for us.

final edit (hopefully): i hear you all and i know i have a lot of reflection ahead of me. even though some of this is hard to read, i really do appreciate you all taking the time to respond. i think my family has a lot of discussion ahead of us and i specifically have some growth to do as a mother and christian. i also want to let those of you who have voiced concerns know that both of my children are loved by my husband and myself and that i plan on talking with my daughter (maybe even showing her this thread) about how i can do better by her.",3
"for wanting to divorce my transgender wife (i'm a lesbian)? update. original post over here(https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/araeds/aita_for_wanting_to_divorce_my_transgender_wife_i/)

firstly, i want to thank all of you who gave your opinions and advice. after reading some of the comments, i realised that i have left this situation for way too long. so i had a sit down with my girlfriend and my wife and we had a long, long talk.

firstly, to all those asking if my wife is pretending to be transgender in hopes that she'll become ""my type"": the answer is a big no. in fact, she doesn't have romantic feelings for me at all, which i'm so glad of. it turns out that the reason she hasn't pursued anyone in the ten years that we've been married is because she doesn't really feel romantic or sexual attraction at all, towards anyone. as a member of the lgbt community myself, i have heard of this. again, i was surprised that she had never said anything to me, but she told me that she's always felt quite ashamed of this, because it's not normal. that's why she agreed to marry me in the first place: she didn't want to marry anyone for real, and marrying me was her ticket to a single life without being judged.

secondly, i'm going to come clean to my parents. it took a lot of convincing and a lot of tears from both my girlfriend and my wife, but i told them that they've done so much for me and it was time for me to start thinking about them, and not myself. i don't feel comfortable doing it in person, so i will be telling them over the phone. to protect my wife, i will tell them all why she didn't know i was gay, and now that she's found out we will be divorcing. i will not tell them that she is transitioning. before i tell them, my wife and girlfriend will be moving in with my sister's family for a while, until it's all blown over. as much as i hope my parents will just cut me off, knowing them there will probably some harassment and it may not be safe for them to be living with me.

depending on how my parents react, i may have to move house, so that they can't track me down. i don't believe that they would physically harm me, but i'm not certain of that, and besides, there are other ways they can hurt me. 

once everything has blown over, my girlfriend and i will move back together. my wife will stay with us too, through her transition. and she's welcome to stay with us as long as she wants to after that. we'll get a divorce, so she'll finally be back to just my best friend. 

my wife is a wonderful person. my girlfriend is too, and so is my sister. i am less wonderful. but i'm thankful that i've been given a chance to put things right.

also: fuck the will.",3
"for having sex with my fiance?. so i live on a second floor of an apartment complex with my fiance , my neighbor below us when we moved in, we offered our cell numbers to them several times, in case we were ever too loud so they could hit us up to ask us to be quieter, they declined each time. now the rules with the apartment are ' quiet hours ' are between 9 pm- 7am. after a week the neighbor tells us we walk too loud and we need to stop at 8 pm because that's when he goes to bed for the night. so we did our best to adjust for him, then yesterday about 5pm my fiance and i were going at it, and our neighbor below us bangs on his ceiling/our floor mid fuck, which killed my so's mood, so we stopped. then about 5 mins later the dude bangs on our door and yells at us that he doesn't wanna hear us fucking and threatens to call the cops or apartment management if he ever hears us again.  
  
so, am i the asshole here for getting down, or is he the asshole for losing his shit and demanding us change our lives for him?  
  
  
edit: holy crap, i didn't expect this to blow up. i took some of your advice and reported the situation to property management, they said they will speak to him about it. also starting soon we will be petty and fuck every single day, not extra loud but normal sex, starting at 8pm and go until 859 pm. thanks guys.",3
"for 'secretly' giving my nephew less food at a family campout because he's unhealthy?. my family do huge camping trips every year or so and we have maybe 30 little kids in our close family- we are a huge amount of brothers and sisters. 

my entire family is pretty athletic except for my youngest brother and his wife and son. my nephew is 8 years old and is terribly, terribly obese. he has joint issues on his knees, has that classic overweight knock knees stance, he's cried miserable tears to me in private before because he has to wear enormous basketball shirts and nothing else which he hates, etc.

i'm always trying to get him into physical activity, i've privately spoken to his parents because he feels left onto of his cousins games because they're all so much more mobile, etc. however they are feeders and i've personally seen them buy and feed him things that should feed a family of 4 and he's able to demolish it in one go. 

when we go on these camps we usually go for 2 or 3 weeks at a time, and this time i made sure. i was way more active in the food prep so i could monitor what he ate. he's my favorite nephew and i felt he deserves way more than this. 

i swapped out his sodas for la croix, when it was breakfast time i loaded the kid up on bacon eggs and sausage but i held back the toast and maple syrup, and when it was smores time i made sure he had some s'mores but i made them up myself with less chocolate and graham crackers and more strawberry and marshmallow. 

stuff like that. 

now my nephew is so big that i didn't see a difference, but i kept asking him how he felt every day and the one thing i wanted more for him than anything else- he told me he felt awesome and he was actually for the first time in his life running around with his peers! he would sweat like a lil grubby booger and need to take time out but he could actually play without being in tears from pain. 

at the end of the trip i talked to him and told him that i had made some small swaps to his mealtimes and wasn't it awesome that he was able to get more energy from it?? he reacted in tears, hugged me so tight that i couldn't breathe and was honestly so excited to make a grocery list with me and get the stuff he needs for home. he asked if he had lost weight and i told him that i honestly didn't know because we hadn't weighed him (he obviously has lost weight but this isn't about weight, it's about health) but i told him he probably had built up a lot of strength. 

when we told his parents my brother was super chill about it but his mom flipped. the fuck. out. and told me that i had no right to interfere with her kids food, that i should have spoken about a meal plan with them first, and that it was way inappropriate and crossing boundaries. 

the rest of my family bizarrely joined suit and told me i was way outta line and that i ruined my nephews camping trip, and the only one who seems to see no wrong in what i did is my nephew. even my more sensible siblings think i shouldn't have interfered.",3
"update - for not telling my boyfriend about my ""troubled"" past.  in my previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bek79b/aita_for_not_telling_my_boyfriend_about_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), i (27m) asked you if i was an asshole for not telling my boyfriend of 10 months that i did drugs from the age of 14 to 25. most of the answers were that i was being an asshole and that i needed to tell him about my past if i wanted our relationship to go anywhere. some of you suggested talking to my therapist and my friend (who called me an asshole in the first place) about it, and to write down everything in a letter and give it to him.

so i took a week to write and rewrite and rewrite the letter again, and i brought it with me to two sessions with my therapist. she gave me some more advice (btw she didn't know i was seeing someone that seriously, otherwise she would have advised me to tell him sooner), i rewrote the letter another couple of times, and i decided saturday would be the day to do it. i also decided to actually read the letter out loud to him, instead of having him read it.

on saturday i almost changed my mind, but when he came over, he could immediately tell something was the matter because i was jittery as hell, so i did it anyway.

i won't go into extreme detail here, but the jist of the letter was that i used to do drugs for ages, i relapsed and overdosed several times, my mental health issues that i was seeing a therapist for are not my actual diagnosis but symptoms of ptsd, i told him what caused the ptsd and how it led to me turning to drugs, and finally that i want him to know exactly who i am before committing to me, and that i understand if it's too much to handle.

he started crying and said he was sorry for the things that happened to me and that i did to myself, and that he was happy i trusted and loved him enough to share all of it with him. he said he does want to stay with me because the person he's known for 10 months has never made him feel anything but happy and loved, and that he's prepared to take a chance on me. (he said a bunch of other things that i can't even remember because i was so distressed and we were both crying a lot, but it was all positive.)

and that's it, we're still a couple, i don't have any dark secrets anymore and i'm looking forward to being in a loving and honest relationship with an amazing guy. i truly feel like i'm luckier than i deserve to be and i'll do my best to make it worthwhile to him. i'm still a bit shakey because it could have easily turned out much different, plus i've always had low self-esteem, but i'll try not to get in my head about it.

thank you all for telling me to get a fucking grip and deal with this before it was too late, you're nicer than people give you credit. and especially thank you to everyone who said they were proud of me for being sober and to keep it going - you have no idea how much that means to me!",3
"for refusing to cook my boyfriends steak rare?. i've been with my boyfriend for a couple years and normally we get on wonderfully and there's 0 clash of personality. 

one of the things that we don't always see eye to eye on is food- i love to cook and experiment with food, and he is very much a meat and potatoes kinda guy. 

i recently ate a steak that was well done that tasted really good. i know there's going to be a lot of people turning their noses up and saying 'impossible' but honestly, it was delicious and i wanted to try and recreate it at home. 

i asked my boyfriend if he would be interested if i purchased some steaks and i specified it was an experiment to give the well done steak a try at home. he said he was on board. 

on the day of i prepped and was ready to go. at the last minute he decided he wanted it rare. i was super disappointed and irritated because i wouldn't have ordinarily bought the steaks midweek, it was specially to give this a try- and i was excited because i thought he could try it and i had a feeling he'd enjoy it.

i said i was not preparing him a rare steak. i said if he wanted to cook his own steak rare that was fine but i had been excited to prepare this for him. i ended up cooking my own steak and he ended up making his own. he's been telling everyone and anyone that i'm petty and should have just accepted that he changed his mind.",3
"for refusing to adopt my sil's child unless i'm the only one called ""mom""?. ok, backstory. my (27f) husband's (29m) older sister (36f) had a child when she was 19 from a one night stand. he was adopted by a nice couple a couple states over in an open adoption. they will send her pictures, are friends on facebook and occasionally have little get togethers. he calls her ""mama t"", as her name starts with a t. although she does not celebrate mother's day with him, she asks those around her to wish her a happy mother's day and becomes depressed when she is not acknowledged. she is very active in birth mother groups and speaks annually at a camp on birth mother's trauma and issues. she is unmarried and has always desperately wanted to have a family and children.

also for reasons that are not relevant (medical), my husband and i have decided adoption is the best idea as we cannot/will not have a biological child together naturally.

about 6 months ago, t announced that she is pregnant again. she told us she wants to have the baby but, once again, is not in a financial position to keep the child. so she's looking for adoptive families. our families all know that we have been looking to adopt and so she came to us about possibly adopting her child.

my husband thinks it would be a good idea. the timing is right and his sister is a ""known quantity"", as he put it. ie we know she isn't doing drugs or drinking. i'm not opposed, but i had some concerns. for one thing, i don't want my child calling anyone else ""mom"". we also live 45 minutes away, and from the way she acts from her first child's birthday and mother's day, i'm not sure it would be healthy for anyone involved.

after discussions, last weekend we went to t and told her we would be willing to adopt her child. she and my mil were thrilled, as the only other prospective birth parents she had spoken to were 2000 miles away. until i told t that she would be aunt t, not mama t. she freaked on me. told me that i was trying to erase her role as birth mother from the child's life. i told her that the child would be very aware they were adopted and that t was their birth mother, but they would not be referring to her or treating her as a mother. she burst into tears and said i was trying to take her baby from her. i told her that, if we adopted it, it wouldn't be her baby anymore. that... didn't go over well.

my mil has decided to stay out of this issue as much as possible. the entire rest of the family, who lives nearer to them, has been telling me that i'm being heartless and selfish and taking out my misery of being unwilling (they all know i'm capable) to bear children on her. my husband supports me in front of them. he has said that if we aren't united then we won't do it, but has also privately expressed to me how nice it would be to have a child genetically related to him. i guess he didn't realize how strongly he felt about passing on his genes until the option was back on the table?

tl;dr i refuse to adopt my sil's unborn child unless i'm the only one called mom. aita?",3
"for encouraging my 4y/o to push away another kid who keeps violently hugging her?. just had a fight with my so because of what i told our daughter about ""legit violence"". going to roll the story out as short as possible.

so there's this kid in my daughters day care. he's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. overall he's a cool little brat and i actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because i think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. anyway. my daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way ""too hard"" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. sometimes he kisses her in this situation. she says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. i saw those ""greetings"" some times and know what she means. 

she already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. 

so basically i told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. i said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. 

i watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied ""but he might push back or beat me if i do this"". i simply told her ""then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult"".

my so overhears our conversation and told me i'd be wrong here. that it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. i said i didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. i think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.

aita?

__________________
**edit:** holy crap, this exploded. thanks for the gold! i didn't expect to get so much feedback and thank everyone who participated in the still ongoing discussions.

i'll add some details here. 

1. my daughter told me this whilst we played legos. it was just some of those random kid stories that sometimes come out. this shows me it's something that she thinks about. i don't want her to develop a negative attitude towards her day care, so i considered this to be a small problem that could get bigger and therefore needed a solution.

2. i don't the other kid is a bully. his parents have a hard time as they also have a severely autistic older son that needs a lot of their time. and when they have time for him, they are overly careful. i also don't think that his behavior is a sign of sexual abuse, but he might be emotionally troubled.

3. i think that the daycare teachers do a good job but they don't have all-seeing-eyes. 

4. i wish my daughter becomes a straight forward, self-conscious and secure person that always finds ways to voice or show things that make her uncomfortable. i'd like her to know that she can talk to me and my so about everything, especially in her teen years.

"for leaving my car profanely vandalized?. a month ago, i parked in a spot on a public road (the street i live on) that someone had tried to save for themselves using a folding chair. i usually won't do that but it was the only spot left. anyway the next monday i went to take my car to work and someone had spray painted bitch across the whole side of my car. 

i went to the cops and it wasn't too hard to figure out what dumbass did it, a few neighbors knew who always put the chair out to save the spot, and figured it was them. a neighbors doorbell camera feed proved it. i got a $1200 settlement for the damages, and decided not to use it to fix my car because my car's a $2500 junker that i'm planning on replacing within the year anyway.

i instead got my boyfriend who's office has a vinyl sticker printer to print me a big red sticker saying bad, and another that's a ""censoring"" exclamation point and i put it on my car so it reads bad b!tch now. 

my friends and coworkers think it's funny, i work in a trade where much cruder stuff gets tossed around every day so it's nbd driving it to work. if anything i've gotten more respect for driving my ""bad bitchmobile"" around 

but i've heard from other neighbors that it's...

1. pissing off my neighbor that did it, because it's reminding him i took his money and didn't do shit to fix my car

"if i still give my stepson the birthday gift i bought for him despite his mother asking me to hold it off for a month because she knows my gift my upstage hers and she wants to see him enjoy her gift first?. my husband joe and i have been married for a few years. he has a teenage son, jack, with his ex-wife kim. joe and i have a great relationship with jack, who lives with us half of the time, and we are civil with kim. 

for a couple of years now, jack has been into a sport that i am also into, and last year he decided to train in that sport seriously. he has been doing very well so as a reward and to encourage him further i decided that for his birthday this month, i would buy him an important 'equipment' used in our sport. he has always wanted to own one himself and if things go well it will be with him for the next ten years so i know he will be very happy with it. 

yesterday kim called me and told me what gift she will be getting jack (we do this now to avoid getting him the same gift, which has happened before). i told her that i got jack the equipment for our sport. she was quiet for a while and then asked me if i could get another gift for jack's birthday and just give him the equipment in october.

kim said that she knows jack will absolutely love my gift, so if he gets my gift and her gift at the same time, her gift will be upstaged by mine and all of jack's attention will be on my gift. she said she has been saving for jack's gift for a while so she would like to see him be happy and thrilled about her gift, and that is not likely to happen if jack receives our gifts at the same time. 

i understand where kim is coming from, but to me it doesn't seem right to treat giving gifts to jack as a competition for his attention or affections that we have to resort to 'taking turns'. why can't we both give him our gifts and make him as happy as he could be on his birthday, a day that it supposed to be about him and not about us?",3
"for turning off the dryer on someone who removed my laundry before it was done?. i live in an apartment complex that has a common wash room for clothing... laundromat style. today i did a load of laundry, and all was normal until i went to go get my stuff out of the dryer. someone had taken the liberty of unloading the dryer and setting my clothing on a random washing machine. my clothes were dry, yes, but i had set a timer for about 4 minutes before the dryer ended so i could free it up asap. i walked into the wash room knowing i had time left on the dryer, expecting to see my clothes still drying. upon noticing the disparity i became pretty mad.... so what did i do? i noticed the other residents clothing still had 37 minutes left, they probably bought 40 minutes. i decided to open the dryer door, stopping the drying cycle, close it, and not start it. the question is, am i the asshole for ensuring my fellow resident a soggy pair of underwear after they stole dryer time from me, and took the liberty of throwing my personal laundry around without my knowledge.

this happened over the past few hours. so my wife and i started bickering because i forgot to buy her favorite kind of ice cream both times i went grocery shopping this month. i told her i'd go out and get some but she started yelling at me. she works a really stressful job so i just figured it was that.

she didn't want me to go and make a trip to the store just for the ice cream where our local food store is about an hour and a half away (living in a rural place sucks). i insisted, she said no, i said i wouldn't worry about it then. she got mad and said she would go get it and that i could sleep on the couch. i told her ""i'll be godamned, i bought the bed and if you have a problem, you can sleep on the couch"". she countered with the fact that her name is on the lease so it's her roof and i wouldn't be sleeping on the bed under her roof.

by this point it's escalated pretty bad just because of a childish quarrel. but i decided to take it a bit further. while she was gone, i took apart the entire bed and drove it to my friends house.

"for leaving my pregnant gf after a fake ""miscarriage""?. basically my parents, her parents, and nearly all my friends are calling me the asshole for breaking up with my pregnant girlfriend (it's my kid) so just looking for perspective here. i'll keep things as objective as possible and happily accept my final judgement.

&#x200b;

3 months ago we found out that my gf (or ex now) is pregnant. it was a big surprise since we take precautions (condoms, bc) but she said it might've been a broken condom + she was bad about staying on bc routinely. regardless, it was confirmed she's pregnant. i'm 21 and she's 20.

&#x200b;

i took the news badly at first. i became surly, didn't talk, and just kept to myself for 2 whole days right after she told me. i was terrified and did not want to be a father at all. i just needed time to adjust to the news. i think she expected happiness from both of us as she imagined i'd scoop her up and kiss her and cry tears of happiness after hearing she's pregnant (i know this bc she even referenced that scene in the office where pam/jim find out they're having a baby).

&#x200b;

our relationship during this time was extremely rocky because she wanted us to be engaged before the baby came, and i dragged my feet. i took her to all of her appointments, paid for as much as i could afford, and was there 24/7 for anything she needed. i guess it was more emotional connection that i just couldn't force through and she could tell.

a few weeks ago she sits me down and tells me she lost the baby. she says she had stomach cramps and then she miscarried. i was asking her a lot of health questions (i didn't know if a miscarriage this late into a pregnancy was normal?) and she kinda waves me off and is like don't worry i'm ok. after this our relationship's getting slightly better only because i'm slightly more relaxed now. she could tell and asks me to be honest about how i feel about the miscarriage. i tell her i'm sad it's happened so suddenly and mostly still worried for her but deep down i am really relieved because i 100% wasn't ready to be a father.

&#x200b;

wrong answer. she starts screaming, crying, throwing things at me. she says she's not miscarried, that it was a test to see my dedication and i've failed it completely. in short we fought for like 3 whole days after this, with little sleep bc she'd randomly throw cups of icy water on me if i dozed off. at the end of that i said i can't do this anymore and broke up with her. i told her i'll be there for the baby and i'll pay my share of whatever is needed but i can't be her boyfriend and i can't marry her.

&#x200b;

\-----

now friends and family are all telling me that i overreacted, that its just pregnancy hormones and could i blame her? everyone's saying things like ""you can't leave a 20 year old girl to be a single mother"" but i know that if i married her it could be the worst mistake of my life. aita?",3
"for telling my girlfriend that there are fundamental differences between being a mom and being a dad?. my girlfriend and i have a daughter who is the absolute light of my life. my girlfriend has always been more of a hands on parent, but i am actively involved in our daughter's life and do things with her every day. however, my girlfriend often nags me about doing more for our daughter and yells at me for not anticipating what our daughter needs all the time. i pointed out to her that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different from a biological perspective; from the beginning, she needed to have more hands on time with our daughter because of post partum depression and breast feeding and such, and these types of things carry on through childhood as our daughter is naturally more used to physical contact and comfort from her mother than from me. my girlfriend did not like this at all and blew up at me and accused me of being sexist. i am not sexist; i just think there is a fundamental difference between a mother and her child and a father and his child, and some things that come naturally to her don't come naturally to me. am i the asshole for my view?",3
"for threatening to quit my friend's podcast if he doesn't stop bringing his girlfriend on the show?. me and my friend, mark, have our own podcast dedicated to movies and entertainment. the podcast was his idea and he's more or less the main host, but i'm the co-host and we both appear on every episode, sometimes just the two of us and sometimes with other friends. but about a month ago, mark brought in his girlfriend, meg, and she added absolutely nothing to that episode. we were discussing the phase 4 of mcu films and during our conversation, meg just randomly interrupts and asks ""is batman in the mcu?"" the whole episode was just her asking really dumb questions like that and mark had to explain to me that she doesn't really follow movies as close as we do. i asked him why he even brought her on, and he said ""she wanted to be on, so i said yes."" i even told him that our podcast would benefit from having guests who are more knowledgeable on movies and he said that he'll try to explain that to her.

ever since then, she's been on every episode we've done and our podcast has been taking some heat for it. comments have been left telling us that she's detrimental since she rarely knows what she's talking about and she always interjects with comments and questions that make no sense. for example, a few weeks ago we were talking about hobbs and shaw and meg kept referring to idris elba as chris rock. we kept having to correct her and she said ""didn't a movie with chris rock just come out?"" we had no clue what she was talking about and it was really frustrating. whenever she's not making stupid comments, she's always interrupting with some non sequitur, like one time when she randomly asked if soup counts as a drink while we were discussing the new zombieland 2 trailer.

but a couple of days ago is when things got ugly. me, mark, meg, and a couple of other friends were on the show and we were suppose to be giving our thoughts on ready or not, but meg seemed to be upping her interrupting, non sequitur game. i was trying to give my thoughts on the movie, but meg was taking selfies and kept asking mark what she thought of them. i was really trying to control myself, but she just kept interrupting me with questions like ""what's this movie even about?"" and ""are we ever getting another titanic movie?"" it reached a point where i was trying to talk and she interrupted by asking ""have any of you guys ever been to paris?"" i lost my temper and shouted ""shut the fuck up!"" at her. and while we were still recording, mark yells at me to not talk to her like that and i started yelling that i'm done with the show. 

i stormed out and called mark later, telling him that i'm no longer going to be part of the podcast if he keeps bringing meg on. i explained that she's affecting our views, but he said that she keeps asking to be on and he doesn't want to say no to her. i reiterated that i'm going to quit if he keeps letting meg on and then he accuses me of ruining our podcast and that i'm ""going too far.""",3
"for giving my wife a baby hamster after she miscarried two months ago?. me and my wife have been married for almost two years. its been our dream to have a big family. she is 21, i am 24. we are both healthy and have an active sex life, but she has a heart shaped uterus and has miscarried twice,  the last time being two months ago. after losing two of my children i am also depressed but i try to keep a positive attitude for her.

our second miscarriage was in the second trimester and was very difficult as we both started to feel like ""mommy and daddy"". we were ""competing"" over which gender it would be.

i thought the baby would be a boy so i bought a bunch of baseball stuff for babies, little hats and mitts. i also made my ringtone on my phone ""watching scotty grow"" by bobby goldsboro. just sort of a playful thing since i joked we would name him after my grandpa scott, she wanted a girl and made hers that ""girls want to have fun"" song.

anyway, the baby was a girl named charlotte. shes been despondent these past few months. i havent been exactly ecstatic either but she wont even eat some days.

i kept my ringtone the same for a little bit, partly because i was sad and partly because i forgot. she heard it one day and started crying terribly. i changed it, but i also resolved then to try and make her feel at least somewhat better.

wife doesnt like cats and dogs arent allowed where we live but she had a hamster growing up. i bought a baby hamster with a big glass case and put a teeny tiny pink bow on her. i gave her to my wife with a card that said ""would you be my new mommy?""

she reacted terribly to it and said that it made her feel horrible and that i was being an insensitive asshole. im just trying to help and the way she reacted put me on the defense so we got into an argument and arent on speaking terms since last friday. i keep the hamster with me on the coffee table as i sleep on the living room couch. ive seen her play with it but she wont talk to me.

"for kicking a special needs child out of my restaurant?. using an alt for obvious reasons. 

it's last friday night. my wife and i run a small mom & pop restaurant in the us. we are always busy on friday nights, when we are filled to capacity we have 300+ in our restaurant. 

we welcome people and groups from all background and all walks of life. we do not discriminate against anyone and take care of every customer like they are family. 

we are mainly and chicken and seafood grill. we serve other items, but our main selling point is our hot wings and shrimp. 

there was a family that came in last week from out of town with a special needs child. he was being very loud the whole time and screaming. i politely asked the family if they could calm him, as we were filled to capacity and the screaming was disturbing half the guests in our restaurant. 

he calmed down, then about 5 minutes later he started back again except this time he was cursing and screaming racial slurs at an african american family sitting behind them. this is where i drew the line. the mother was distraught about it and apologized refusely, but i couldn't let them stay. i asked them to leave, though i did give them 50% off their meal (i don't feel like i should have.)

i let the african american family eat for free and gave them a voucher for a free order of hot wings, which they said they would use soon. 

my thought process is, they were using slander and racist slurs against a large percentage of our clientele. i couldn't have that. 

am i the asshole? my family tells me that i singled them out and embarrassed them in front of everyone, but if this was a national chain they were in doing this then they would have been kicked out immediately with no exceptions. ",3

good news ladies and gents! some of you may remember my previous post , if not read it bc it's hilarious and has a cute cat.

the news: our boy nelson has found his furever home!

he got adopted 8 days ago and i've been waiting so see if it stuck before posting. nelson become a top priority to adopt out as he was one of our most difficult but favorite cats we took care of.

he become pet of the month and got the attention of an older gentleman who came in- get this- with a printed out copy of our facebook post. it was very adorable of him. this man automatically took us as a great candidate for nelson, since he was an experienced cat owner. he had a bit of a sad story, his wife passed last year and their 18 year old tabby passed away 4 months ago. he was very lonely and wanted to get a new friend but didn't want to get a young cat. he is older and doesn't have the energy to take care of a demanding cat. 

nelson was absolutely perfect. i have seen very very heart warming moments with pets and their new families but this one was a top. as you guys may remember nelson is a cranky asshole that you can't help but love. he's not really nice and he is stand off ish but i shut you not when we brought him into the meeting room he pranced over to the man and hopped up onto his lap. my jaw almost hit the floor.

after 30 minutes if nelson going ap shit over this man he was adopted and went off to his new home. 
the man has sent us photos and updates of nelson since then and it seems to be going very very well. i guess he speaks cat. 

i won't be posting photos as the man is in them and ya know, i'm trying to not get in trouble at work again. 

thank you guys for being nelson's biggest fans and i'm so stoked that both of them got a happy ending together

our finances are almost completely separate, but we do live together. this happened last week, when i mentioned in passing that i was excited for the computer to come in the mail. she all of a sudden blew up on me that i shouldn't spend that kind of money without asking her. i can more than afford this computer. aita

edit: i help my wife with our baby every evening and on the weekends. i obviously do not do as much to care for our child due to the fact that i am not with our child as much. i do help my wife with the parenting responsibilities during the week and on weekends. sometimes i just wanna sleep in because i'm up so early every day. my wife and baby are still asleep everyday when i leave for work.

edit2: my wife works extremely hard and i understand that. she works harder than me probably. this isn't about me not wanting to help with our baby. this is about me wanting to get a little bit more sleep on the days i can sleep past 445-530.

"for confronting my parents who don't acknowledge my birthday because of 9/11?. i was born on 9/11 in the 80s. i have two sets of parents, neither set acknowledges my birthday in any way once i turned 15–the year of the attacks. it's always hurt and irritated me. none of them have ever said why but every year i hope for a text or something and it never happens. 

we didn't know anyone who died or was directly affected by the attacks. we lived across the country. other than watching it on tv like everyone else it wasn't something that was  directly connected to us. because then i could understand.

i didn't even know to connect the events of 9/11 to the lack of birthday acknowledgement until this morning when my stepparent messaged me and said they never say anything about my birthday because they don't think it's appropriate while the whole country is mourning. 

it boggles my mind that these two sets of people who hate each other so much have come to the same conclusion that this is the best course of action without ever mentioning it to me. i always feel so rejected. 

for being irritated about this and confronting them? it's not like anyone else in my life has a problem sending birthday greetings. my mil always makes a point to call which means a lot to me.

yesterday (which happened to be our ""three month anniversary"" apparently, i hadn't kept track of it as were not boyfriend/girlfriend quite yet). he texted me saying he had something to show me and asked if he could come over and i was like ""yeah, sure"" he sounded really excited so i was curious what he had planned, i thought maybe he had been accepted to the course he's applied for. but you all know that wasn't it.

he shows up at my place and i instantly spot the plastic on his arm so obviously i ask what that is. he says he's gotten a tattoo to celebrate our thee month anniversary and i already felt uncomfortable there but once he unwrapped it and showed me it got way way waaaay worse. in big bold letters he's had my name (including my two middle names) tattooed with some red and pink roses around. it's maybe 20x7 centimeters large.

i got so shocked that the first thing coming out of my mouth was ""you f*cking idiot"" which i know was kinda rough, i just couldn't believe how he'd think that was a good idea. we could have been married for ten years and i would have thought it was stupid but after three (!!) months?? that's just crazy.

he got really angry at me, calling me ungrateful, that he'd spent so much money on it to make me happy and show me how special i am to him. i told him that tattoo is just making him look like an obsessed weirdo (once again, harsh i know). then he called me a ""stupid whore"" (he's never used that sort of language with me before) and stormed out the door.

i was wrong.

"for blowing up at my sister because she kept trying to say that i'm traumatized?. my younger \23\ sister and i \27\ were both adopted at birth. i'm trans racially adopted (our parents are caucasian) while she is the same race as our parents. neither of us are biologically related to each other or our parents. we both had happy childhoods and our parents were always supportive of us. we always knew we were adopted and i never felt that my parents loved us any less than our brother (we have one older brother who is our parents biological child). neither of us had ever cared to look for our birth parents when we were younger but our parents said that we would be able to when we turned 18.

about a year ago though someone suggested to her that she read the primal wound. the gist of the book is basically that if you're adopted you will be traumatized for the rest of your life because separation of a baby from the mother is traumatic. i read a bit of it and i didn't care for it and honestly i thought it was bullshit. if the book's hypothesis were true then children whose mothers died in childbirth would be traumatized or those born through a surrogate. 

however, she took everything she read to heart and basically blamed adoption for all of her problems. she did 23andme and was able to find her birth mother. her birth mother was nice to her at first but i'm not really sure what went down but she eventually had to tell my sister to keep away. the birth mother had remarried and had done really well for herself and was not interested in the close relationship that my sister wants. from what i understand, she apparently had wanted to keep her but was unable to do so because of financial reasons. she regrets giving up her sister but at this point in her life she has come to terms with it and has decided with her husband (who is not my sisters father) that they can't be there for her as her parents. (apparently my sisters  bio dad died in prison about 15 years ago) 

since then my sister has been very moody. every time we see each other she pesters me to read the book and we end up fighting about it. all she does is complain about how her life would be so much better if her mother had kept her or if our parents had given her bio mom money so that she could keep her. 

finally last night when we were having dinner together she started her usual complaints. i finally got mad and went off on her telling her that our parents were the best thing that had ever happened. she probably wouldn't have done well with her bio mom and adoption isn't traumatizing and that book completely messed up her life and i wish she hadn't read it. she is now not talking to me.

"(45/m)for proving my friendship even if it costs my buddy his marriage?. here we go - i have been in a group of friends (husbands, wives, kids) for almost 20 years.  we started out as a neighborhood group and have grown bigger as our friendships have evolved and most of us have moved out of the original subdivision.  we are adults 40-50 years old.  the men play golf most every weekend and one evening during the week.  holidays and birthdays are big get-togethers with sometimes 50 people. i am currently the only unmarried person in the group (divorced in 2011).  this is the sticky part.

&#x200b;

about 7-8 months ago, one of the women in the group named cindy, started coming on to me.  while flattered, i would never do anything as i like her husband mike and have know her kids since they were preschoolers.  it seemed like a little harmless flirting at first, but then it moved into some very direct propositioning.  she had her reasons for wanting to become sexually involved and put a mild bit of pressure on me to begin an affair with her.  one of the ways she pressured me was to text me racy pics and those soon moved to x-rated pics and videos.  it really put me in an awkward spot and i told her that.  my response was that i found her attractive, but she was strictly off limits to me since she was married.  even if i didn't know her husband - i still would not have done anything.  and i didn't.

a few months ago, i found out that i had missed a few golf days and i just chalked it up to bad timing.  well....there was a huge 4th get together and i asked around about it and it seemed no one would own up to me not being invited.    apparently, there have been other events that i didn't know about and i wasn't invited there either. i finally got some answers last night when i ran into a friend and her daughter at the grocery store.  she would barely look at me when i spoke to her and her teenage daughter spilled the beans.  cindy was caught with the racy pics on her phone and ""confessed"" to mike that i had put her up to it and was pressuring *her* to have an affair.  needless to say, i was stunned at this revelation.  i thanked her for her honesty and went home and thought about it for a long time.

&#x200b;

i have saved every single text and pic.  last night i printed them all out.  if i showed mike 10% of what she said to me and what she sent to me - he might leave her.  meanwhile - i am pushed out of my friend group for doing what i thought was right.  i told her at the beginning that this was heading down a road of hurt - but when she got to the painful part, she pushed me under the bus.

"for not giving up our table to an autistic kid?. okay so a few days ago i went to a nice cafe with my friend. we decided to sit in a corner that was close enough to the bar. we didn't even took our jacket off yet and a young teenager (13 or something?) came towards us. 

""i always sit there.""
-""oh well... it won't bother you if you sat somewhere else wouldn't it?""

the kid suddenly starts screaming for his mother and she came asap. the kid told her in tears that we 'stole' his favorite place and pushed him away while doing so (we didn't even touched him). his mother comforted him and told us with a painfully forced smile that they always sat there since he was a baby and that it was 'their special spot'. i politely told her that i wasn't planning on moving since we had this table first. the kid starts screaming, letting himself fall on the floor while his mother started to yell at us for being 'rude and unreasonable people' and that her son is autistic and doesn't likes changes. people were now looking at us and quickly the manager came. they clearly knew each other and the mother started to say that they were loyal customers, coming every 2 friday nights since the birth of her son and that she wouldn't be throwing a fit if the manager didn't just banned all those rude young people. 

the dad just stood there and glared a bit at us but that's it. after a couple of minutes they left while pulling the kid out of the place. 

my friend told me that we just had to move to another table to avoid such thing since autistic kids/people will get frustrated if things don't go their way.

"for not giving my husband a baby right now. so we've been married for just shy of 3 years now and my husband is really getting on my case to have a baby. to give you readers a sense of ""getting on my case"" i mean like asking for a deadline on when to start trying and questinioning me on going back to school because that means that babies might be delayed.

i've stated that i do want to have kids but not right this second. my main concern is that there is a lot in instability and uncertainty in our lives right now. his job has taken us to live in europe for 3 years and in a year we will be moving again, but we don't know where to yet. i want to wait until there's a little more certainty in life and to know that i'm going to have a good support system in place because he travels for work for long periods of time. his response to all of that is ""i don't want to wait anymore"" and ""people do this all the time"" and ""it's not fair to him""

age: me 33, him 30
we did have extensive discussions prior to and after our marriage. we both agreed that we wanted to have time together before we brought kids into the picture. he was planning on switching careers to create a more stable life to start a family. he has since changed his mind on that which means lots of moving and moving away from friends and family for the foreseeable future. as for my education, that was also discussed extensively but was put on hold because of financial constraints. until lately.

"for ""fat-shaming"" my daughter. i'm putting fat-shaming in quotes because while it's obviously wrong, i don't think i did so. i'm directly quoting my ex-wife.

i have two kids, harry (14m) and sally (17f). besides gender, they are also polar opposites in terms of everything else. while harry is a staple of the baseball team, sally fits in much better in the drama club. i love both of my kids regardless of their interests (i was a bookworm in high school myself).

where harry is very in shape, sally is not. she has always struggled with her weight a bit but over the past two years she's reached the point where she's ""morbidly obese"". i think the overeating is stress-related from the divorce, and my ex-wife refuses to work with me on any sort of diet plan (she'll visit me on a weekend and tell me that the ex let her drink soda the entire time).

anyway, this weekend i was cooking burgers and taking orders. harry ordered three patties (he had been practicing all morning and was starving) and i said no problem. sally then tried to ask for the same. i won't transcribe the whole conversation, but basically i told her she would be better to sticking to one or two because she should be trying to lose weight and that she wasn't burning off these calories. she then asked me why harry could have three while she couldn't, and i was honest that he was burning off the calories while she wasn't. 

anyway, sally is extremely upset and not talking to me, the ex is fuming at me for fat-shaming, and harry told me he has to eat less to make sally's diet easier on her. i'm just wondering if i'm the asshole.

"for telling a neighbour that i've seen her in porn?. she moved into my building yesterday (1st november). i've seen her in a couple of videos. her face is clearly visible, enough so for me to be certain that it's her. normally i'd just leave it at that, but here's the thing: they're filmed through a window. like 2 buildings next to each other, and the bed is right next to a large, curtainless window in one building, and the camera is in the next building over pointed at the bedroom in the first building.

i assumed it was meant to be like that and everyone was aware/involved but after meeting her she really doesn't strike me as the type of person to do porn. not saying there is a ""type"" but from having met her she's very religious, wears clothing that's baggy or full coverage, seems a bit shy in general, and she's an accountant. for all i know that's a concious choice she's made, like a persona she's created, so people don't link her to the videos, or it could be her actual personality, and she has no clue the videos exist.

the guy in it looks at the camera enough for it to be noticable, she never looks at the camera once. i'm thinking maybe she doesn't know she's made it.

update: i ran into her on the lift. i asked if she could stop by mine quickly (we're sort of friendly as i helped her move some stuff in to her flat). she agreed. i said ""look, i found something and i'm only showing you because it doesn't look like you know it's going on"" she stopped me and said ""is it porn?"" i said yes. she then told me that the reason she broke up with her ex and moved here is that she found one of the videos online, realised it was her and her boyfriend in the footage, confronted him, and he admitted that he and his buddy in the next building had been filming her. she dumped him on the spot and is currently trying to get the videos taken down. she thanked me saying that while she was aware, if she wasn't she'd want to know and she was grateful to me for helping out a stranger. she's coming over next week to drink wine and watch strictly.",3
"for not paying for not paying for my gf's son anymore?. i'll try to keep this short.  i've been with my gf coming up on a year november.  she has a 15 year old son.  when we first got serious i tried my best to bond with him, but he had no interest in it.  

a few weeks ago both of them were staying with me and while she was at work he gave me a really hard time.  he even broke a small statue i had (on purpose i think) and when i told him to go sit in the living room he told me he didn't have to listen to me and went outside.  when my gf got home i told her about it and she said that he had a point and to leave punishment up to her.   

since then i've had the opinion that if i can't have a say in how he acts then he is 100% her responsibility.  i've told her that if she and him comes to my place and she leaves she needs to hire a sitter.   i've also stopped paying for meals when we all go out to eat.  instead of paying the whole bill i have it split and pay for mine.  i don't make attempts to plan stuff he might enjoy as well.  

it's only been a few weeks but it's causing a lot of fights.   i feel like i'm just standing up for myself though and setting some boundaries.  she's right, he is her son.",3
"for 'being around half-naked girls' even though my girlfriend doesn't want me to?. notice the quotation marks, since those are sarah's (my girlfriend) words, not mine.

so, i'm a competitive swimmer, and recently some kids at my school have started a water polo team, and asked me to join. i said sure, since all my clubs (fbla, investing club, deca) ended a few weeks ago. it's not too serious as of now, and is more of just a fun thing, i guess. for example, a lot of guys are just wearing normal swim trunks, and a lot of girls are just wearing bikinis, even though that's not the official uniform.

and that's where the problem comes in. sarah is a bit insecure of this, and doesn't like that i'm spending every day after school playing water polo with a bunch of fit, half-naked girls. 

so she asked me to quit. i just said i'm not going to, for a few reasons:

1) water polo is really fun 

2) i need to practice swimming in the off-season, and a water polo is a novel, more fun way of doing it than just swimming laps.

3) her demands are ridiculous and i don't think she should control what i can or can't do because of her jealousy. i don't tell her, for example, not to hang out with her guy friends. so i don't see why should be able to order me around. 

i feel like both of us just can't see the other side's logic, so aita?",3
"for purposely taking my time at a self service checkout?. so i live in the uk and we have self service check outs. the way these things work is you queue up and wait for a checkout to become free, you don't approach until the person before you has paid, bagged and walked off. so today i went to my local store. now after a heavy night out my friend asked me to pick him some bits up whilst i was out, he gave me his card and off i went. i grabbed our items and went to the self service check out. i paid for his items and mine were still in the basket, bagged them and put the items on the floor. a woman rushed over and shoved her stuff on top of mine, i explained i still needed to pay for them items and she huffed at me and asked why i just bagged other stuff and not mine. i was kind of shocked and said i don't need to explain myself but the items are being paid for separately. she huffed again took her items off mine and carried on standing there with her basket (bare in mind there is about 9 other self service check outs) she mumbled under her breath and continued to huff and this started to make me quite angry and anxious like i was being pressured. so i decided to scan one item, pay for it, bag it, scan another item, pay for it. i did this about 3 times and she tutted called me an asshole and walked to another checkout. i scanned all my items paid and left, giving her a smug look as i left. so reddit, am i really the asshole?

edit: seems i am getting mixed reactions to this. i think some people don't quite get british mannerism and the importance of queuing patiently, like no one queues up quite like the british 😂 we literally do it for everything.  also just to point out there were many opportunities that other checkouts emptied where she would of been next in line so able to take them. she chose to stay whilst making comments. i had every right to be at my checkout for my time needed.

edit 2: i totally think from comments i am the asshole but i was justified in my actions. aja = a justified asshole? 😂",3
"for sitting on a guy his bag in a full train?. i totally do not think i am the asshole here. but he called me an asshole and so did a random woman standing close by. so maybe i am wrong... here goes!

its a full train during rushhour. i enter the train and see one empty seat. i quickly move myself to the seat and the guy sitting next to the empty seat says.

you can't sit here. it is reserved for my friend. i told him that it is rush hour so he cannot do that. he refuses again, he is coming soon he says.

i say again, no you can't do that so i proceed to sit down but stop at the last second to not crush his bag with my buttocks. i ask him to.move it. he says no.

so i sit down and he calls me rude and an asshole. a woman sitting on the other side does the same. i start reading my book.

"for cutting off my brother for publicizing that i haven't had a vaccine. no, i am not an anti vaxxer. i've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which i opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because i was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). i didn't realize i was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. i've decided not to get it now that i'm older because i'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, i know i don't have hpv, and my husband has been vaccinated.

i discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. i guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted i be fully vaccinated before i come around his kids. i basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because i'm not doing anything with them that would spread hpv even if i had it. he decided after this to make a public facebook post about his ""anti vaxxer sister"" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. 

i asked him to take it down but he refused unless i got the shots. i got pissed because i have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. i told him i'm done with him. no more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. my mom told me i'm being too harsh. aita?",3
"for laughing at a baby cpr class. short but sweet. my spouse and i were expecting and attended a baby cpr class held at the local hospital for expecting parents.  the instructor began by showing how to locate the proper position to perform cpr compressions.  we were instructed to find the armpit and then measure from the armpit to the middle of the chest. that is the location to perform cpr compressions. simple enough, right?

wrong. a person in class immediately raised her hand and asked, ""sooooooo....do we need to measure from both armpits to the middle, or can we just measure from one?"" this once again proves the old adage that there are no stupid questions, only stupid people who ask questions. the instructor looked at her dumbfounded and i, unable to help myself, let out a single audible chuckle. nobody else laughed, and i received a few disapproving glares. but come on...that is some funny shizz.  so i ask you good people of reddit, aita?

"for not letting this mom send her younger son to my son's birthday party?. my son (10) made a pretty good friend (10) within the last schoolyear. they are pretty inseparable and do everything together. i would arrange playdates for the mom, saying i'd pick both boys up from school and when i'd get there, i'd find out the mom had also made me responsible to pick up the boy's younger brother (5) too. she says that his feelings get hurt if he also doesn't have a playdate. when the little boy comes over, my son and his friend tire of him quickly. they don't want him to play with them and while i try to encourage group play, it's just a lot on them. they want to play with different things with him. typically, the little boy ends up following me or my older daughter around. 

this happened quite a few times throughout the school year. i thought it might stop in the summer, but when i went to pick up the 10-year-old, the 5-year-old was ready to go too and how could i say no to him, when he was all ready? he's just a kid and it's not his fault his mom is doing this.

 if i try to talk to the mom, she just says that the little brother gets insanely jealous and that he loves coming to my house. my son overall doesn't mind him coming, so long as he stays out of my hair and i can manage it.

now, my son is having his 11th birthday party. he's having a simple birthday sleepover with a few friends, including the older brother of this 5-year-old. i talked to the mom and said that it was just for the ""big boys"", and please don't tell the 5-year-old he could come. i'd be too busy that night to play buffer. she got really offended and tried to say they were a packaged deal. i gently explained that it couldn't continue. she finally relented, but said that her son was going to be very hurt.

am i being an ass here? i feel bad, but i feel she's the only setting her son up for failure here. (not why i said he couldn't come, my son doesn't want him there and i just don't have to watch him.)",3
"if i reported my lyft driver for asking me out?. let me preface this by saying that i do not want this man fired. he said this is his full-time job and i'm not a revenge person.

&#x200b;

i (23f) live in a city where the mass transit is pretty good. occasionally i get a lyft if i am going somewhere unfamiliar or i need to get there fast.  i was planning on going on a date to a bar a few nights ago, but both of us got out of work late and were pretty tired.  instead, we planned a spa-night at his place. i decided that since i didn't know how to get from his apartment to the subway, even though they're close, i would get a lyft since it was getting late.

i got picked up at my house by a male driver who was maybe 30 and there were two other women in the car.  it was a fairly pleasant ride while the other two were there--lots of great conversation about where we were all from, what we all do, etc. i mentioned my date and how excited i was for it. about 5-10 minutes from my drop-off, the other two get out.

immediately i could feel a massive change in tone and energy in the car. we stopped at a light and he started to turn around to look at me, saying how much he liked me, how great he thought i was, that he could use more people like me around. i mumbled a ""thanks"" and tried to change the subject. i really thought i had made it clear i was not interested, but uncomfortable.

i thought he past my drop-off and i texted my date saying he needed to wait for me in the lobby, then opened the app to make sure he was on track.  i'm not sure if he actually did take a longer route, but we were on track by the time i looked. i was ready to get out if we weren't.

he pulls up really slowly to the apartment building, asking if ""it was cool if we stay in contact"" and go out. i blurted out that my boyfriend wouldn't like this and ran to the building. he didn't pull away until my date opened the second door on the inside of the building for me.

i told him what happened in detail and he was livid. he said i should report this, that it was harassment and that this man was in a power position over me. he was easily twice my size and was driving me around a part of town i was unfamiliar with.  i kept saying no, i didn't want him to get in trouble and i would feel bad. he stood firm and said that if this man had done it before, he would definitely do it again.

it has been a few days and i still feel really icky about it. it put such a damper on my night. i know it is dramatic, but it took me awhile to come down from it and relax.  all i wanted was to have a nice night with this really great guy, and i was uncomfortable for like an hour before i could completely calm down and enjoy it. i'm not even comfortable enough to use lyft anymore.

i really don't want to ruin this guys life. if i reported this incident to lyft?

edit: i should also say i'm scared to report this since he literally knows where i live now; i didn't say that it was my house, but thats certainly the vibe i would've gotten if i had been the driver.",3
"for sharing my boyfriend's fetish with his parents.. me(18m) and my boyfriend(20m) live together, we've been together for 2 years. his parents visit us few times a month. every damn time they visit us they make comment about my skin, i'm extremely pale, almost white. at first i just laughed it off, but then it got irritating. they could tell that i wad clearly uncomfortable and still continued making comments. 

the thing is, my boyfriend has a thing for pale skin. so few days ago they visited us again, his mom made comment about my skin 2 times and i answered with ""yeah, your son has fetish for it"". my boyfriend just chuckled, they got really quiet and didn't talk to me for rest of the night. they left, they told my boyfriend that they felt disrespected and i was extremely inappropriate and immature. my boyfriend doesn't think it's a big deal but he says it was a little immature.",3
"for not changing my cat name for my offended neighbor?. i saw a similar post here a while ago and i feel like sharing mine too, though i think it's not that much of a deal.


i have recently moved in to an apartment with my boyfriend and my 2 year old black cat, lucifer. despite naming him lucifer we also call him lucy and lulu. some of the friendly neighbors visited our place with gifts as a welcome gesture and it did not take long for us to know that one of their 7 year old daugher's name is lucy. 


the mother(who did not visit our place before and probably heard from the other neighbors) had been knocking our door asking us to change the name of our cat because

1. they are christians, and linking my cat name ""lucifer"", which we also nickname ""lucy"" to their daughter ""lucy"" is offensive.

2. the cat is black, the little girl is black too, thus racist.


i declined her request as my cat was named even before we moved in, so it was just a coincidence that their names were similar. whats more, my cat is a strictly indoor cat and nobody would probably hear me calling him ""lucy"" or ""lucifer"" outside our apartment, in fact nobody would have known that we owned a cat.


the neighbor is getting rather upset over this and even my boyfriend said that changing lucifer's name is not a big deal, we could even lie to her that we have already changed his name. i said no, why should i change my cat's name or lie about him changing name when it is really none of her business? i don't want to give in to her over such silly reasons. aita?


update: lol did not expect so many comments and upvotes. actually this is jus 1 of the small incidents we have encountered after moving in, i wouldn't have posted here if i didn't see something similar earlier(the sadie post). i do hope that the lady has given up as her last visit was more than a week ago, we never talked since. 

as for lucifer, he is still lucifer, we named him after the lucifer drama series, but i watched cinderella too. he looks evil but is actually very well behaved and loves chin rubs.",3
"for turning the tables on my gf?. my gf has an ex that she talks to all the time, which i dont really mind. he lives a few hours away and they talk mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.

there is a girl i work with, let's call her a. a is very nice, and she and i have been friends since i started working at the place i do. i used to think she was cute, but i never made any moves on her. the only reason i have her number is for work related reasons, i have never even seen her outside of work.

well the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw a and i chatting while we were eating lunch. she lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. i asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but i cant be friends with a girl who i never even asked on a date.

this situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. i dont think it was fair, and i want to call her out on it. for calling her out or should i let it be?

edit: phrasing, sentence didn't make sense.

edit 2: so the resounding feedback is that she is cheating on me. which, i don't believe. the reason i dont believe that is because (like many of you) i thought she was cheating so i looked at their texts. they are all very innocuous and mainly about old friends. never mentioned meeting up, and he lives 3 hours away. take that for what its worth friends of the internet.

edit 3, months later: turns out you were all right. she was projecting because she was keeping guys on the side. she never ""cheated"" in a strict definition of the word but she was talking to multiple guys. we are broken up and i am happily single. what i have learned is that projection is a huge red flag. live and learn.",3

https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bkpb4c/aita_if_i_back_out_of_being_maid_of_honor_at_my/


i've logged into this throwaway a couple of times over the past week and honest to go have fifty dms and comments asking me to update so here goes. 

some of you may also know that my story got featured on major, major news websites and blogs. it was crazy. i left way too much identifiable info in my post so pretty much all my social circle knew it was me and it was also the way most everyone figured out ex had been cheating. we had a ""meeting"" among the four of us as to whether or not we proceed. we pretty much agreed that not showing up would cause more drama and ""whispers"" than if we didn't show up so we agreed to be civil and stay in our respective places. but having to spend that hour or so in same room with him just fueled me up with adrenaline and pure rage. 

that led into  bachelorette party that night where i got freaking hammered and honest to god made out with so many guys while dancing i can't even count. i also ended up having my first one night stand ever with a 20 year old super cute guy from our university's wrestling team who was so sweet. i'm not proud of doing that but i'm also not ashamed either because it made me feel desirable and almost like i was going into the wedding day and rehearsal with some ""parity"" since, he i can be ""naughty"" too.

ex and i were of course paired up at rehearsal and i hate to admit this, we had an absolute blast with each other. it wasn't a mistake that we had such a great and fun relationship, we are very compatible. it probably also worked because we were able to put ""the issue"" on the side and focus on something else. 


wedding was very much the same way. we walked arm in arm down the aisle with big beaming (and genuine) smiles since we were there for our friends. i had prepared a really nasty moh toast that would have praised my friend and her loving relationship, loyalty and truthfulness (i even included a line about you never know who is going to call in the middle of the night) but as the reception wore on i could tell the weight of the situation was really getting to my ex and i felt like i really didn't need to twist the knife any further so i gave a nice but very generic toast. 

as night went on ex was more and more out of it and sitting by himself either on his phone or with his head in his hand. i didn't want people talking about him so i asked him to dance with me which was actually really, really nice since we both didn't say anything. at the end of it he but his hands around my face like he was going to kiss me (i would have totally let him, in that moment) and just whispered how sorry he was and walked away. i got distracted and turned around he had apparently left the reception. i hate myself for it but i was so sad to see him go. this wedding is literally the last thing we ever have to do with each other. there's no expectation of got sundays or bloody mary brunches with his mom, we wont argue over how bad ipa beer smells or who forgot to put gas in the car. like the reality of him just being able to leave without me arguing that i'm not ready to go yet (classic introvert/extrovert pairing here) sunk in that this is over. like over...over. i went and cried uncontrollably  in the kitchen of the hotel until the bride found me and cried with for a good half an hour. with that i knew i made the right choice in being there for my friend. 

so that is that, wedding is over and done with. no real drama, lots and lots of hurt feelings and a huge broken heart that i'm not sure how it will ever heal. i wish i could just turn off loving him but it's not going to happen.


edit: last word on this guys and it's really honest to god say thank you. this sub has been such an amazing place (and particular shout out to /u/snausagefest who is a great moderator) and absolutely coaxed me into the right decision.  i still have something like 1200 inbox notifications and i'm sure the people who gave me gold and silver are in there somewhere. if i don't get to thank you privately please know that i do thank you. and thank you so much for the words of encouragement that i will move on. i know i will. right now its so fresh and i just keep thinking ""god if you wouldn't have been up that night worrying about work, you never would have seen the text come in and you'd be ignorant to all of this...and happy."" but that's not healthy because wishing to live an uninformed and ignorant life is never what i wanted to be. anyways i'm indulging self pity and i don't want to do that anymore. this has been a crazy ride and i just want to say thank you. and foxnews...you kinda suck.",3

"for not accommodating a kid's allergy?. i'm a ""class mom"" for my kid's home room this year. 

basically means we help out with arts and crafts and provide food for events. 

i was in charge of the ""welcome back"" party this year. 

three days before the party the teacher wrote and said one of the kids in class has allergies and could i avoid bringing any food the kid is allergic to so she doesn't feel left out. 

i said sure i'll do my best to accommodate. 

i get the list. dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, gluten, citrus. 

i wrote back and said i couldn't be sure anything made in my kitchen would be free of all those things. 

the teacher sent me a link for a restaurant that would accommodate her and said i could get the food from there instead. 

i looked at the menu and it would have cost $300 to feed all the kids from that place. the groceries for my home made food were $100 even. already more than i'd hoped to spend. 

i said i couldn't do that for the whole class but i could get the kid whatever she wanted from there alongside the other food. 

the teacher said i should be more considerate to the child's feelings because she's feel left out while the other kids ate something she couldn't have. 

i went ahead with the party as planned, and got the kid a meal from the restaurant. 

i was removed from class parent after that. my daughter is disappointed because she was looking forward to having me volunteer this year, and now i'm considering contesting it. but i need outside confirmation that i'm not the one in the wrong here so i don't accidentally embarrass myself or my daughter.

"for refusing to cancel a trip with a friend over my gf's insecurities?. tldr: i (26f) and my gf (30f) has been together for just over a year. a friend who i had one-sided feelings for 5 years ago, planned a trip together with me this weekend, we had invited my gf but she refused to go. originally it was a trip of three friends. but the third friend backed out. my friend and i still want to go. everything is booked and paid for. — but once learning it's gonna be a trip for two, my gf absolutely refuses for this trip to happen, and instantly told me to cancel. 

—-

i (26f) and friend (27f) has been friends since middle school. same high school. same university. we had always been close friends. 5 years ago, i had developed feelings for her, and was promptly rejected. we were/are incompatible and she didn't return my feelings. we drifted apart for 2 years, i lived out of town for 3. — but my main little group of friends include my friend. and she is still one of my closest friends (we had mended the friendship in the recent year). 

for the longest time, we had always talked about taking a skating trip to another city close by. we had done it in first year university and had a great time. we wanted to go skating again. this year i'm finally back in town. we promptly planned it. invited other people, but they were all busy, and one flaked out. we had invited my gf, she did not want to go. then we planned the trip for a later weekend in feb, but my gf wanted to spend that weekend with me instead (even though we live together). and insisted on changing the date of the trip. 

so it was changed to this weekend. when my gf isn't in town. —- my gf asked us to change it! and my friend had to rearrange other plans in her life, as had i, to make it work. 

then the third friend flaked. i didn't tell my gf. it just didn't occur to me that she'd have a problem with this. i want to go on the trip. so what if it's a two person trip instead? — but i didn't neglect to tell her intentionally. i just didn't think it'd be an issue with her. gf never had insecurities about this friend before. 

last night, she asked me again about the details of the upcoming weekend trip. fair enough. i was honest. clarified it was just gonna be two people. 

instantly, gf freaked out. went berserk. — saying this is a date instead. a two night three days date. that how could i do this to her. how could i betray her trust like that. — that this trip i'm taking is akin to cheating. 

she instantly started to set rules and boundaries for my friend and i. apparently i can no longer take the initiative to talk to her. i cannot hang out with her privately. i am to intentionally drift apart from my friend. 

i'm flabbergasted. if i am going to cheat, or had the intention to, it'd be so easy to cover up. gf isn't in town. i don't post on social media. she was even invited to the trip, and, we even changed the date because she wanted more time with me. — and why would i cheat??? if my heart and mind isn't just set on my gf, i'd have just separated with her. 

just 'cause i liked my friend for three months 5 years ago, i have to throw away the friendship and the trip? i can say, without any question, that it's just pure friendship now. and i do not foresee anything festering. friend is a friend. 

i then refused to cancel the trip. and told my gf we should both reconsider our relationship. she instantly felt personally attacked and is blighted by ""you are considering breaking up with me because of her?"" 

no. i'm considering breaking up with you because of your unreasonable controllingness. your lack of trust in me. and my sadness that you are forcing me to cut off a good friend. 

she didn't understand. and she couldn't stand talking to me anymore. deleted me via the chatting applications. told me she will not consider breaking up with me. i can consider alone. and tell her the results via email. 

so. here i am. aita? 



update: 

trip is cancelled. it's gloomed over and i rather just wallow in sadness over the weekend. i cancelled because: 

1. with my gf's outbursts. i cannot enjoy the trip.i no longer have her blessing. 

2. i need to work on my relationship with her. and if i go on this trip, there is no working left. i do not believe she will see past her own insecurities and see it's just a skating trip.

for confronting my husband about a fake silicone penis he wears?. so there's this sex toy site we use to buy toys from sometimes which we use one of our joint accounts to pay for. the site has a unique name it appears as on bills mainly for discretion. my husband was sorting out his own personal bills and out of plain curiosity and interest i just looked at one of the slips and noticed that site was on the bill from a while back. it seemed weird that it was on there as we always use our joint account for that stuff. so i did a bit of snooping around the house looking for what it could have been and i found a silicone limp penis (almost like a dildo but limp). when i cross referenced this with the site it turns out to be a toy that guys can wear in their pants to make them seem 'bigger'. so i confronted him about this and he was really embarrassed. he said he didn't do it for anyone but himself because he wanted to feel more masculine and better about himself. since then things have been a little awkward between us. he seems quite embarrassed and is generally less talkative than he usually is. aita?,3
"for not paying a domme after she ignored my safe word?. i'm in my early 20's and into hot chicks dominating me, i'm into ballbusting (you can guess what that is) but i'm more of a light to medium max player of it. i contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. i met up with her at her place on saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. i did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. i said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and i agreed to this. the ""safe word"" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if i drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. i thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and i'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though i said med power max. i'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. i basically almost pass out and felt like i couldn't breathe and was choking. i'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. i cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, i hit the ground holding myself and i knew something was wrong with my berries. i gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 i owe her. i slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and i'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. she starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and i wont ever get another session. i limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. my balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so i was scared af, not to mention the pain. thankfully nothing was damaged down there and i'm recovering well.

i told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said i'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that i didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. 

aita? also please don't judge me lmao, i know it's a weird fetish.",3
"for siding with my brother in law over my own sister?. for background, i am australian but i currently live/work in singapore. i have two houses back home, one of which i have been letting my sister and her family (3 kids) live in almost rent free (just enough to cover property expenses). they've been living there almost 10 years now without any issues.

my sister is married to a top bloke called campbell. great guy, works for a mining company and makes a decent living. my sister is a kindergarten teacher and doesn't make very much. this might be relevant which is the only reason i'm mentioning it.

anyway, it recently came out that my sister has been having an affair for a while now. campbell is obviously fucking devastated and the two of them immediately agreed to separate and eventually divorce. now, the both assumed that being my sister, she should continue living at my house (with the kids) while campbell rents an apartment. when i found this out i called campbell and asked whether he was okay with this arrangement, or whether he would prefer to continue living at my house (with the kids) while my sister moves out. he obviously wanted to continue living there with the kids and only moved out because he assumed i'd side with my sister.

so i tell my sister the new arrangement and she loses her mind over this. i basically told her in no uncertain terms that going forward campbell will continue living at my house, whether they divorce or not. 

my family thinks i'm being a manipulative asshole for:

1. not siding with my own sister

2. inserting myself into ""their"" problems

3. doing this despite knowing it will help campbell get primary custody since my sister can't afford to take care of them + pay rent

i take the opposite view: i think i am doing the morally right thing by not letting my relationship with my sister cloud my judgement. in my opinion, campbell is the one that deserves to continue living there since my sister is the one that ruined the marriage by cheating.

so yeah, sorry for rambling, aita?

just realised i should mention that sister staying at my other property is not possible.",3
"for making my boyfriend believe our cat ran away?. we are both 24 and have lived together for 2 years in my apartment. for my birthday last year and he got me a cat for us to share which he named lucy. i thought it was a cute name and i took care of her so well and love her very much. last week we were having sex and he moans out lucy's name. i ask him why he is moaning our cats name and he says it was just an accident. i ask some of his friends if he knows anyone names lucy and discover that is a coworker of his that i didn't know he had. i talk to her and find out they have been cheating for the whole time we've had the cat. he literally got me a cat and named it after her so he would have an alibi if he accidentally said her name. i told her that he was my boyfriend and she didn't believe me so i showed her some pictures of us together and she started crying saying that she didn't know he was dating anyone. i told her that i was sorry and that it wasn't her fault but i'm glad we found this out. i kick my boyfriend out for cheating and he moves in with his brother. he tries to take the cat that he gave me. i don't feel that he should get the pet since he didn't buy it out of love but only as a cover for his cheating and i've been the one taking lucy to all her vet checkups and buying all her food and toys and everything. i convinced him that the cat ran away and he's upset with me for that but i don't really care because i'm done with him and i don't feel he deserves to keep the cat that he gave me and never really took care of. aita?

edit: i'll try and answer the most common questions. 
- i don't think he planned to moan the cats name during sex, he has called me lucy before in casual conversation and i didn't think anything of it because of the cat. 
- i did try to tell him the cat was a gift but he started spamming me with messages and since he knows where i live and work i didn't want him to start stalking me since he was showing signs of that. once i told him the cat ran away he got mad and now doesn't want to talk to me anymore since it's my fault i lost the cat. so now i can just take care of my cat without worrying about him showing up unannounced 
- yes i am renaming the cat, one of the comments suggested lucky and that will be her new name. :-)",3
"aita, for telling an overweight girl to lose some weight?. so basically i've been going to school with this one girl for 5-6 years now, she's always been overweight. this year i think she is at her heaviest. she's always complained about her weight and how people make fun of her for it (not to be but i she's loud when she talks to her friends. 

about a week ago i walked by her and her friends near my locker, she was red faced and looked like she's been crying alot. one of her friends looked at me and said ""what?!"" kinda angrily, i turned around to try to just avoid it i guess and she said ""what are you looking at?!"". i sheepishly turned around and said ""if being made fun of for being overweight bothers you so much, maybe it's worth losing some of it"". 

aita? i wasn't trying to be rude or anything but she and her friends were kinda shocked i'd say that.

edit: not trying to defend myself but i'd just like to clarify that she was upset in this instance about her mother telling her to lose some weight, and she does eat a lot of food even when she's happy and would definitely be full (from what i hear every other day after lunch her stomach is stretched/full)",3
"for being upset at my parents even though they paid for my wedding?. so, i'm ready to get roasted here but i will accept my judgment. i got married about 6 months ago, and my family offered to pay for most of the wedding. this was a hugely generous offer and i appreciated it a lot. i work in public service and there's no way i could have afforded a wedding at all. while i knew that by accepting the money, i really needed to let my family have the final word on a lot of decisions, i had one hold-out request that blew up into a huge fight. 

my parents have a neighbor, let's call him charlie, who is just complete trash and nothing like any of their other friends.  i have nothing to do with him, and if he shows up at their place, i leave. he's racist, he's bigoted, he's exposed himself to women at parties as a ""joke,"" he's grabbed women while drunk, and he's a terrible alcoholic. inexplicably, this guy is teflon with my parents' friend group and according to them it would have been unthinkable to snub him. 

now, we fought about this - an ugly fight. tears were shed. i begged. my dad (he's mean) called me the ""c-word"" (and more) and threatened not to come to my wedding at all. he left me sobbing on the street and told me i was killing my mother because i am such an ungrateful bitch.

i am ... not proud of this but i caved. i was feeling vulnerable. i didn't want all the ugliness, my dad is seriously ill so every fight feels like i can't take it back, and my mom promised that charlie would be escorted out at the first sign of trouble. i wasn't so sure, particularly because my group of friends is very diverse and my husband isn't white, but i trusted her that it would be okay for a few hours and i, according to her, ""wouldn't even know he's there.""

fast forward to the wedding. charlie gets rip roaring drunk and starts trying to fight our dj. he's screaming ""fuck you,"" flipping him off, he's mad i guess because he doesn't like the music? the bartenders cut him off and he's escorted out. i didn't know this at the time because it was all handled so quickly. when i found out, i called the dj and bartenders personally to apologize, but i'm livid. i'm so embarrassed. i know how easily this could have been worse, it could have just as easily been my husband's family, and i don't know that i would have ever been able to apologize enough. 

i am so angry at my parents for bullying me to invite charlie, especially because he did exactly what i knew he would do and they act like no one saw this coming. because i could have and should have walked away from their offer to pay and sidestepped the issue? or is it fair of me to be upset because they used a generous offer coupled with a threat to blow up my family and estrange themselves to manipulate me to do something that made me horribly uncomfortable and it caused potentially disastrous consequences?",3
"for wearing a bikini during a work trip/vacation?.  my company took my team to another city for a week for a conference. it was an extended trip with a lot of free time, so we all did some fun things too and the trip turned out to be half work/half vacation. there is no beach in the city where i usually live, so i suggested that we all go to the beach one afternoon. at the beach, i stripped down to a bikini to sunbathe and go swimming. after i did that, a coworker pulled me aside and said that what i was wearing was inappropriate, that even though we had gone to the beach during the afternoon for fun, we had gone together as a team of colleagues and that we should not be dressed so ""unprofessionally"". 

i did not take him seriously, and just blew him off, i had a lot of fun that day at the beach. however things have escalated at work now, there have been complaints lodged about my lack of professionalism and inability to take criticism and change. complaints have been lodged with hr and my boss right now. it is worth noting that none of the others were wearing a bikini, they were dressed way more conservatively, even at the beach. aita?

edit : a lot of the guys were wearing swim shorts and no shirt or just a pair of boxers. i don't know how that is appropriate, but i'm not? all the women were wearing more clothes though, not even just bathing suits. the women were wearing t shirts/shirts with longish shorts/capris/pants. it is generally the women in my company who are conservative, but idk why this guy (who was very professionally dressed in just a pair of jean's shorts) took it up on himself to instigate this",3
"for not giving my cat back to her original owners?. sorry for grammar and spelling, not very good at writing on a phone 

about 3 years ago, a good friend of mine was moving to australia without the intent of coming back. she needed to find a new owner for her cat bread. 

naturally, i opted to adopt bread and she agreed.  i successfully adopted the cat and she left to go to australia. 

a week ago, friend moved back and demanded that i gave bread back. i kindly refused but she got more and more upset with me. 

bread is very happy at my home with his cat buddy shark and i do not want to give bread back because friend told me she was never coming back from australia.

"for playing a big prank on my religious cousins?. i'm in a...not good situation right now. my mom is having some personal issue, and she's making me (15m) stay with my cousins in tennessee for a few months. they (aunt, uncle, son (14m), daughter (11f)) are very christian and superstitious. they believe in casting out demons, and they anoint us with oil and don't allow any video games or modern tv. they think it will let evil into the house. they drag me to church two times a week, and it's like a weird one where they speak in tongues. i don't want to disrespect their beliefs, but it's really not my kind of thing. 

i really enjoy reading fantasy books, and i liked watching those kind of movies too before i moved here. yesterday, my aunt found out i had a copy of city of bones and a few other books like that, and she lost her shit. she burned them in this fire pit thing they have, and now she want to do regular inspections of my room. 

i was obviously pissed, so after she went to bed, i took ketchup from the fridge and drew a pentagram on the bathroom mirror (supposed to look like blood lmao). i also wrote names of random demons i knew around it, along with the phrase ""we will eat your soul."" 

needless to say, they lost their minds. and they called my other aunt to come get me. my aunt hadn't said a word to me, and she's anointing every doorway in their place. my uncle made me wipe it off and he called me some not very christian words. 

for doing the prank?

edit: for the people saying that my mom is an asshole for leaving me...she didn't really have a choice. my mom is in rehab right now unfortunately. if she didn't go she would have to serve time.

edit again: thanks to everyone who commented or messaged me — there are lots of nice people in this sub. my other aunt picked me up, and she's gonna find out if my mom will let me stay at her place.

last edit: to update you all, i'm hopefully staying with my other aunt until my mom gets back. thanks to all the people who offered to replace my books— i appreciate you all. i only had five in total burned though, and my aunt is working on getting my religious aunt to give me money to replace them. 

also, please don't insult my mom. she's been through some really awful shit that i don't want to share here, i'm proud of her for trying to get clean.",3
"for throwing out all of the food in the communal fridge?. ok i know i'm probably ta, but honestly i feel like i'm justified. 

i've just returned to work since having my bub. i'm a coeliac and obviously can only eat gluten free. i make a special lunch everyday for work. 

4 days in a row my first week back at work and my food was 'going missing' when i'd go to get it from the fridge. i sent out an email to all staff in the office about it. 

the next day the same thing again so i went to my boss. he sent out an email reminding people to only eat their food. 

the next day it happened again. fyi i have my name on it. i asked my boss if we could put cameras in the lunch room, he said no. i asked if he would comp my lunch expenses as i had to buy from the local cafe and shits expensive yo! he again said no. i sent out another email and spoke to as many people as i could (about 15 out of the 20 in my office). 

the next day i was feeling more positive. i left a note on my food again stating it was mine and to not touch it. lunch time comes around again and my food is gone. i was pissed so i threw out everything that was in the fridge. 

no one technically knows it was me, as i haven't admitted to doing it, just like the jerk off stealing my lunches hasn't come forward. 

the boss sent out another email threatening written notice for anyone who touches anyone else's food. my lunch hasn't been touched since. 

my husband told me i was an asshole because everyone in my office didn't deserve to have their lunch ruined because of one person stealing mine. i think i'm justified because no one took the blame for what they did, and my boss wouldn't do anything about it. im sure once everyone had their lunch ruined they understood how much it would have sucked for me.

"for not telling my uber passengers that i speak chinese?. i'm white, i took four semesters of mandarin in college. i picked up my uber passengers tonight, who were international chinese students, which is not unusual, it's a relatively large college town.

i did my usual uber driver routine: ask a question or two to gauge willingness for conversation; if i get one word answers, and/or no followup reciprocating questions, i leave it alone. they gave off a major no interest in talking vibe, so i left it alone.

cut to 3 minutes later, and they start talking about something which, for the sake of their privacy, i feel legitimately uncomfortable even sharing anonymously here. it was really fucked up heavy personal shit. i am not a fluent speaker, but good enough to follow 80% of a conversation, and i was getting very uncomfortable.

i guess the reason i ask is because i am 100% sure that if they had any idea i could understand them, they wouldn't have been talking about what they were talking about. it felt like i almost lying by omission? i could have interjected super briefly, in chinese, to let them know i understood, but it felt like that would have been more awkward than just letting them believe i didn't understand.",3
"if i were to dump my boyfriend for being a snobby movie critic?. my boyfriend hosts his own podcast dedicated to movies and he even has his own studio that he's renting out so that he can record there. he has some co-hosts, legit recording equipment, and he has a decent following. i always go to the studio to just sit on the side and watch as he records, but i've noticed that he's started to become a bit different ever since the start of the podcast.

on a podcast a few weeks ago, the topic was 2016 movies as my boyfriend and his co-hosts revisited some of their favorite and least favorite films of 2016. one co-host brought up arrival as their favorite film of 2016 and while he was talking, my boyfriend loudly says ""yawn!"" and he explains that he thought arrival was boring. my boyfriend then goes into this giant rant about how he hated arrival, calling it one of the most overrated movies of all time. he says that he looks down on people who like the movie because he claims that they ""think they're smart"" and he says that he's proud of himself for ""seeing past that movie"" and it's ""faux attempts at intelligence"". and whenever someone would try to change the subject, he'd just interrupt them and go right back to talking about how much he hates arrival.

then just a few days ago, he was recording another show and the topic was mcu movies. my boyfriend brought up that he thinks age of ultron is a ""hidden gem"" and ""massively overlooked masterpiece"". one of his co-hosts scoffed when he said those things and that set off my boyfriend. he starts attacking the co-host for his taste in movies and started saying stuff like ""just because i have a better understanding of the art of film-making, it doesn't mean you have to be jealous of me."" that was actually enough for the co-host to just walk out in the middle of the show and my boyfriend said ""that's fine, i only want to talk to true auteur's of film on this show."" 

and just yesterday, i asked him if we could see shazam together, but he simply responded with ""i deserve better than those dc movies."" i confronted him and told him that he needs to stop acting like he's smarter than everyone over his taste in film and he said ""truth hurts, doesn't it?"" and it's like this a lot. whenever i'm watching a movie he doesn't like, he'll just scoff and say ""typical"". i'm thinking of breaking up with him, but i also feel weird about dumping him over him having differing views on film. what do you think?",3
"for insisting my sister replace a playstation her kid broke, even though i was watching him?. my (25f) bf (25m) has a ps4 and a couple dozen games, he bought it new 3 months ago, but with no warranty so he's made a conscious effort to keep it in good condition, including packing it away in the box when he doesn't think he'll use it for a while. he did this yesterday, putting the console in the box and then putting the box into a larger plastic storage container with all his games, as he's out of town for next week. he left the container under our bed, but the side was poking out so you could see the playstation box through the plastic.

today my sister (31f) had a few work meetings, one after the other, over about 5 hours, and rang me in a panic, saying the sitter called in sick and she needed someone to watch nephew (11 years old). i reluctantly agreed, and she dropped him by. he wanted to watch tv so i gave him the remote and got on with my work. couple hours go by without incident, but then nephew got hungry. i went to the kitchen to cook for him. about a minute later i went to check on him and he was gone. i found him upstairs in mine and bf's room, digging through the container with the ps4 inside. by the time i'd gotten there he'd taken out the box and a few games and i asked him what he thought he was doing.

he said he was bored and wanted to play. i said no. he did the whole ""i'll tell my mum you're being mean to me"". i said ""tell her what you want, still not happening"". nephew, on realising i wasn't about to let him use it, tried to run past me, carrying the ps4 in his arms, presumably to hook it up to the tv downstairs. idk what happened exactly, if he tripped or lost his grip or what, but he dropped the ps4, right at the top of the stairs. it fell down the flight of stairs, and when we checked it it's a mess of cracked plastic and wiring.

i clean up, give nephew his lunch, sit him in front of the tv. the whole time nephew is saying that i should have just let him use it. i rang bf to let him know and he's obviously mad/sad but says that it's fine when it clearly isn't. he asks me to look up prices for a new one and it's more than we can afford rn.

sister arrives, asks if nephew was any trouble, and i tell her about the console. she immediately says i should have watched him better. i tell her that i was cooking and that i watched him today for 6 hours, as well as countless other times i've babysat, and never once expected payment, but in this case it's ""you break it, you buy it"", and i show her the prices i got when i searched for a new console. she says i'm being unreasonable and she's not replacing it because she didn't do it and i was watching nephew, plus she's not paying for a new one when bf had his for a couple months already.

aita?

info: bf has previously told nephew that he isn't allowed on it and due to lack of warranty bf treats the playstation like it's made of glass.

info: bf bought his console from a friend for £229 and it sounds like the friend had had it for a while and just never used it, which is why the warranty was expired. the replacement i found was used in ""fair condition"" for £129 but the page i showed my sister contained the £129 one and some significantly cheaper ones that would have been fine.

also: when i said ""new one"" i meant one that isn't a heap of wires and plastic, not a brand new pristine condition ps4.

update: bf complained to his brother, who offered him a free xbox and some games. idk what type but it's whichever one was before the latest one as the brother upgraded to the latest console.

update 2: bf is saving up for a new ps4. his birthday is in september and his grandparents still send him a card with £50 in it which is already nearly half and he can budget for the rest. he says that this is probably a good thing (losing the playstation and me arguing with my sister) because now we have a reason to never babysit again.",3
"for thinking my girlfriend sleeping with her dad is inappropriate?. my girlfriend is 20. i'm 27. 

we're currently on vacation together with her parents. we were all on a fairly empty beach by our rented bungalow. my girlfriend fell asleep, and because it was sunny out and my girlfriend is very pale, her dad suggested that she should be brought inside. he carried her inside which is the first thing i thought was weird. he came back out for another half hour and i spent time with him and her mom. then he said he was getting tired, and he was heading inside for a nap. her mom and i just kind of nodded and continued chatting for awhile before we went back inside as well. when we went inside, he was sleeping with her in the bed, spooning her. this is something that we do so i couldn't help but feel kind of creeped out. later when my girlfriend woke up and her parents weren't around i explained to her that i thought it was bizarre they were sleeping in the same bed. she insisted that i'm making the situation something it's not and that it's not weird at all. i told her i found it ""inappropriate"" and she called me an asshole for it. aita, or is it just weird?

edit: some people are asking for more info.

we've been dating for a year. i've met her parents on several occasions and we're all just about close enough now that we're taking a vacation together. i always knew she was a daddy's girl (not that she self-professed this title, it's just what i picked up on), but i feel like this is what crossed the line for me. they're not really ""weird"" otherwise, but they're obviously very close. a little too close imo. they're super cuddly. when we were waiting to enter a restaurant the other night she leaned into her dad's chest and he started stroking her hair. other than that there's nothing super unusual. just typical exchanges of parental affection like hugs and sometimes kisses on the cheek. i have yet to see her cuddle her mom the way she does her dad. 

my train of thought is she's 20, a fully grown adult. past a certain age cuddles with your dad shouldn't be such a public display of affection.

some more info: 

she's typically mature, which is why i find her behavior around him unusual. until now if i had to describe her, i would say she's independent. however, when they're together, she seems dependent. her behavior is almost regressive. she's not the mature adult i'm used to being around, but more like a child. when we're all crossing the street together he says ""wait"" or ""careful"" and sometimes holds his arm out in front of her. she isn't bothered by this at all, where 99% of adults would be. he babies her to the point where she can't even carry a bag by herself and he'll pick up everything for her. again, no objections. meanwhile, if i were to do anything like this, i have no doubt she would tell me not to worry about it, that she can do it herself.

yes, she is an only child.",3
"update! for calling my brothers gf ""miss piggy"" part 2: the piggy strikes back.. i just want to start by saying holy hell. i did not expect that much attention to my original thread(which is here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/apc2b5/aita_for_calling_my_brothers_girlfriend_miss/)). i did get a good laugh out of it but to be honest you guys got pretty brutal. while i find it funny to think about spiking her food that's a step to far for me. i agree everyone were assholes that was just to far.

so, after my post and reading some of the initial responses i decided i do agree with you all in the end that i need to be an asshole in this situation. so, the next day me and roommate sat down with brother and pretty much told him she's not allowed back here (that morning miss p called him up and said she ""forgave me"" and would be coming over again). the other option we gave him is buying his own fridge while we lock the other up and he foots the electricity bill.  he disagreed to both but because his name is not on the lease he really didn't have a choice.

&#x200b;

so now brothers supposed to hang out at her place. a win win right? well, nope. last night i came home to find miss p hanging out at our house. and guess what she had done? yup, she had eaten some of roommates food. well, i decided to be a little more respectful this time. so i didn't oink at her. i just told her that the food she had eaten was for humans, not pigs. i then threatened to call animal control on her if she didn't leave.

&#x200b;

she did not like this and an argument broke out between the 3 of us. turns out that brother was supporting her this whole time and never planned on caring out what we all agreed on. i'll cut the argument short but in the end they demanded i apologize to her for everything and i told her people don't need to apologize to farm animals. she stormed out crying again but this time ""kermit"" followed her and wouldn't even look me in the eye.

&#x200b;

my brother is staying with her and he's to afraid to come face roommate after last night. we're in the process of terminating his sub-lease with the landlord and i'll be giving him his 30 day notice tonight personally when i visit the barn. so yeah, i'll admit i was definitely an asshole here, but when you're dealing with a spineless coward and miss piggy you gotta break a few eggs to go with your bacon.

"because i wouldn't stop eating my soup?. i know this sounds fucking ridiculous. that's because it is. i promise, this isn't a shitpost. 

so i 20m am a university student. my uni has a cafe/coffee shop and a bar on campus where students can purchase food on their lunch breaks etc. i rarely actually buy food from either of them for two reasons; 1) i receive no financial support outside of sfe, which really only covers my rent, bills and groceries, so i generally can't afford it and 2) i'm a recovering anorexic and still have a lot of issues eating food i haven't prepared myself bc i can't know 100% what's in it. note i am working though those issues and i've improved infinitely from a year ago, but i've still got a ways to go before i'm fully better. usually for my uni lunches, i'll make a big pan of soup on a sunday, portion it off for the week and take it in a thermos.

this weeks soup in french onion. one of the girls in my friendship group at uni is pregnant and currently very sensitive to smells. when i began eating my soup today she immediately began to retch and asked if i couldn't eat something else. apparently, the smell of onion just turns her stomach lately. i said no because it was all i'd brought and she pretty much begged me to go buy something from the coffee shop or something because it was making her feel ill. i told her i can't afford that, and today is kinda a high anxiety day for me so i don't think my ed brain could handle it. she asked if i couldn't just wait and have lunch when i get home (in 4 hours) but i said no again, because i was hungry and anyway my therapist has suggested to me that eating my meals on a bit of a routine could be beneficial for my recovery. she eventually got up and left and some of our friends went with her. those friends are telling me i was being a selfish, inconsiderate dick because she couldn't stomach the smell, and i really feel awful. however, other friends are assuring me it's fine and that i didn't do anything wrong. from the point of view of strangers, aita?

edit: just answering some questions that are coming up a lot. 

1. i'm not entirely sure exactly how pregnant she is but i believe it's around nine weeks. she isn't showing yet but she's telling people. 

2. we were in a dining area. the cafe and bar on campus don't allow for outside food, so there's a sort of ""packed lunch"" area with tables and like microwaves and that where you can go if you bring food from home. you can also get takeout from either the cafe or bar and take it there so its often busy. there were no other tables that were unoccupied. there is outside seating but it was raining today.

edit #2: other things people keep asking. 

1. there weren't any unoccupied tables so my only option in finding somewhere else was to look for an empty classroom. i technically could've, but i had very limited time for lunch and looking for an empty room would've probably taken a good chunk of it.

2. she wasn't eating herself. she and another woman in the group were going to meet another friend for lunch later on  

3. she 100% for sure knows about my ed. i've known her since secondary school and she and her friends used to tease me about being underweight and call me anorexic for years before i got diagnosed.",3
"for asking my wife for an open relationship after two years without sex?. it feels weird to type but next year i will be 30. i have been married since i was 22. my wife is the same age.

3 years ago she had just beaten cervical cancer. she had surgery, and she was a soldier throughout the whole process. i am very proud of her.

after the surgery we didnt have sex for obvious reasons and i accepted that. however she still gave me oral sex frequently. i would try to please her as best i could without hurting her but its tough.

eventually her sex drive disappeared completely. she just did not want to be intimate anymore. this has been going on for two years. she will give me oral sex on my birthday or special occasions but thats it.

i am still very attracted to my wife. i love her very much. i do not want to give up sex for the rest of my life.

i have talked to her numerous, countless times and shes just not into it anymore. its not a pain thing but a desire thing.

i have been reading up on open relationships, basically just flings to satisfy my needs as a man while still living and loving my wife. she was not receptive of the idea at all to say the least.

crying, yelling, you name it. she doesnt understand why id even ask. even after i explain. i want to grow old with her but i dont want to be old now and give up sex.

i dont even know what i couldve done different in this besides just shut up and be celibate forever. ",3
"if i ask my pregnant wife to stop calling me at work and ask me to come home just to cry about random things?. i'm from finland so my english is a bit rusty.

my wife is pregnant with our twin children. she recently took a break from her job because she's too tired to work and it is a high risk pregnancy.

i work as the managing director of a company and my job stresses me out. i only take important calls. my wife doesn't generally call me but i do talk to her whenever she does. she calls if she wants to talk or if she wants me to bring anything for her to eat. 

a couple of weeks ago, she called me and started crying. she wanted me to come home asap. i was shit scared and rushed home cancelling all appointments for the day. and when i got home, i was really surprised. she was crying because the neighbours dog died. i'm not even kidding. i was really scared but it was nothing. 

this has been happening for a couple of weeks. she calls me and asks me to come over. but it always ends up being nothing. i really can't take this stress. i have to go back to to work again. so i discussed with my secretary because she was kind worried and she thinks i'm kind of being insensitive and i should be more understanding. here?",3
"for not warning a tinder date about my weight?. i've been using tinder for a few weeks now. my profile picture is a picture of me at the store that i used to work at. a customer came in with a pet pigeon and let the bird sit on my arm, and then i asked him to take the picture with my phone. i didn't use any filters. you can see me from my midriff up to the top of my head, but tbh i was wearing a sweater. 


i am a 5'8, 162 lbs female, btw. 


i met this guy on tinder and we hit it off. he was really funny and we had some hobbies in common. we agreed to go on a date downtown, to look at pigeons, because he said that he also liked them. when we met he was completely different from how he was over chat. he didn't say anything to me on his own and just answered questions with simples yesses and nos. he seemed angry the whole time and left the date after about an hour, saying he was supposed to meet his friend.


i thought that maybe he was shy in real life, and texted him afterwards to thank him for the date and ask him if he had an omay time. he didn't reply for a few days but this morning i got this text:


>just a headsup not everyone is into big girls, u should rly let guys know ahead of time so they dont get put on the spot. just my advise. hope u find what ur looking for, best wishes.


i feel really embarrassed after reading this text. i didn't mean to put anyone 'on the spot'. i know i'm not thin, but i'm also not *that* heavy. it never occurred to me that this was something i had to disclose before meeting someone. but i do remember reading some posts online where people were similarly disappointed that a date was bigger than they let on. am i one of those deceptive dates? aita?


edit: everyone keeps asking me about the picture i uploaded and if it's from weird 'angles' and shit... no. i thought that was pretty obvious as i said before that a customer took the picture of me with his pet bird. i just put it up because people are always saying that 'action pictures' are better than posed ones and i like birds 🤷🏼‍♀️🐦

otherwise i want to thank everyone for their input, even those that think i'm the asshole. ",3
"for responding to my ex gf's new bf's message by sending him a photo of her giving me a bj. (me and my ex of 6 years broke up 2 months ago) so on the weekend i saw my ex out clubbing with her new bf, didn't talk to her or him literally just walked past and that was that, come monday he requests to follow my instagram so i messaged him asking what he wanted, he responded by trying to talk some shit and trying to rub in the fact that he is now with my ex. i responded by sending him a picture of her giving me a bj and he blocked me. i told a few of my friends and some are saying i shouldn't have done that and some are saying what i did was fine! so aita?

&#x200b;

edit: in my country there are no laws against revenge porn, however i still realise what i did was wrong and just spur of the moment. for those of you asking why i haven't deleted all pictures with this girl already, i've been with this girl since i was 15 and we have broken up one time before in 2017, where we had no contact for 7 or so months and the  out of the blue she messaged me to meet up. after about a week she dumped her new boyfriend and moved out of their house back home and we started dating again. also someone said i took the picture without her knowing, this is not true. thank you all for your input and i see that i am in the wrong!",3
"for losing it at my granddad's funeral?. my grandfather passed a month ago, shortly after my (21f) 21st birthday. my dad left when i was 7, and my mum passed away when i was 11, shortly after my grandma. my granddad took me in straight away despite his age, even though he was still mourning both his wife and daughter.

though still deadly sharp, his physical condition wasn't great in his last few years. i'd express my worry for him sometimes, but he'd always tell me to get lost and assure me he'd ""see me through 'til 21."" he was the light of my life.

when he died, i didn't shed a tear. it's hard for me to explain why, but he was still giving sass on his deathbed, and pinched my arm and told me to not cry because he wasn't crying.

after i left, i received a text from my aunt later that evening that she was disappointed at me for not being visibly mournful and apparently him telling me not to was a very poor response. i ignore this, since we were all grieving.

i didn't return to the house for three days to avoid being alone again. when i did return, i found the shelves empty, bits of furniture missing, and photos taken from the walls. i confronted my aunt immediately, who after some arguing returned most of what was taken.

maybe she didn't think i'd notice, but not only had she taken both my granddad's and his dad's service medals, she had sold them as well.

luckily, i found the selling post on facebook quickly enough and the man who bought them was happy to return them to me. i refunded man, and don't plan on asking my aunt for repayment since i'm just so glad to have them back in the first place. i did not confront my aunt about this.

the funeral arrives, and i'm straight away hounded for going through with a cremation. i keep telling her that it was my granddad's decision, not mine, but apparently this contradicted his catholic values (???)

i'm an extremely mellow person, but this continued into the gathering afterwards. she told others how selfish i was for not letting her take any of his belongings, and how she thought i pushed him into signing his house over to me.

i was soon invited to sit among a table of some of his old friends, at which my aunt was sat too. i tried to not pay her any mind, but the conversation soon devolved and she slipped up and told the table that i hadn't even let her take a single medal.

i lost myself at this, and erupted into a slurry of profanities. my aunt immediately starts crying, and i seize moment to call her out on her selling the medals in the first place. 

i'm not sorry for the things i said to my aunt, but i'm deeply ashamed of my behaviour given the setting. some people have approached me offering support, to which i have not replied, but i have this immense feeling of guilt in my stomach that i can't shake.

i know for sure that i overreacted, but aita? should i apologise to each attendee individually? i'm in a terrible way at the moment and my mind is all over the place. i feel like i need someone from the outside to tell me what to do.",3
"for getting a waxer fired from her job for snickering at my junk?. this morning i went to get waxed because i have a date with someone tonight. not planning on having sex but if it happens it happens and i would wanna be prepared.

i had to wait an entire hour because apparently only one waxer knows how to wax testicles and peen, and i was also kinda pisses that they charge different prices for men... anyways

so i assumed the usual grabbing my legs under the knee pose for the waxer to do the needful... and she snickered. yes, a snorting laugh with nasal flaring and mouth covering. 

i asked what she was laughing at and she said ""oh just your... uhh... undies... cause of the pattern"" (which was a pretty plain checkered pattern so how could that be funny?)

i should probably also explain that i have been self conscious about my size since as far as i can remember. basically my circumcision was botched as a child and as a result i have an abnormally curved penis with visible scarring and to this day, pain during intercourse.

so this is why i believe that she was laughing at my genitals.

after the experience and after i payed i asked to speak to the manager (who turned out to be the owner) and explained what happened.

i then watched the employee get fired on the spot and saw her grab her belongings and run out of the salon muttering something about ""lawyer"" under her breath.

am i the asshole for complaining and getting her fired because i found her reaction hurtful and insulting?

edit: i am not trying to argue about the cost of women's services, i was legitimately ignorant as to the pink tax. i barely have any friends as it is, as my family has cut me off for being gay and i have never had a female bff or even a female friend at all. hell, my date is the first i have had with a guy in a very long time because of my depression spiral. please cut me some slack there? ☺️",3
"update to for not teaching a skill to my oldest son that i taught his siblings. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/d1r1vr/aita_for_not_teaching_a_skill_to_my_oldest_son

i offered the two best options to my oldest which a few days after i posted during dinner.

the first option was work as a salaried employee for his brothers' company for a few years while he learns the trade and then buy in for a partnership in the company. i would've sold him my share for a very fair price. this was the only way his brothers were willing to join the company. he rejected it immediately.

the second option was an apprenticeship i setup with someone i knew and respected. unfortunately, this was based in alaska and he rejected that as well, which i expected.

he then said a lot of hurtful things about me and his mother. i gave in and said i would teach him. some people did suggest this on the first post.

he took all my tools and material the next few days and moved it to his garage. i've been going over to his garage workshop everyday for a few hours to try and teach him.

it's not going that great i have to admit.

i'm physically not in the best shape and he's getting frustrated by it. 

i'm just going to keep going with this and hopefully it'll get easier as he learns more.

i appreciate everyone's input on the first post.",3
"for refusing to spend the night with my boyfriend until he changes his bathroom routine?. my boyfriend and i (i'm female if that matters) have been together 1 year. we live 40 minutes apart. when we spend nights together (up until last week, 5-6 nights a week) we spend them at his place because he has dogs and it's a closer commute to work for both of us. his commute is 5 minutes, mine is 10. 

three weeks ago i switched jobs and now we both start work at 7 am (i can really walk in around 7:15 though). it used to be 8:30. i'm quick getting ready so i can be out the door in 20-30 minutes. this means i'd ideally wake up and shower at 6. my boyfriend though, wakes up at 5:40 and doesn't get out of the bathroom until 6:20. every single day. that's fine. not even an issue, still time for me to shower and get to work.

except. for whatever reason. and i will never be able to understand this. 

he doesn't shower until 6. ever. never ever. 

but he turns the freaking water on at 5:40 when he goes in the bathroom and let's it freaking run until 6 am. he uses the time to trim his beard (every freaking day), go pee, wake up, check his phone, whatever. 

which not only is a tremendous waste of money and a fucking strain on the environment, but it means that my showers are ice cold. i've complained a billion times. he says that it's his routine and he's been doing it since way before he met me. 

he basically said that if i don't like it, wake up and take a shower before him. which would mean waking up a full hour earlier than necessary considering there is plenty of time to get ready after him. 

i complained about it for two weeks, then woke up one week ago today and checked for hot water and it made me so mad that he'd done it again that i told him that i'll no longer be spending the weekdays with him because i'm not going to continue to inconvenience myself and start every morning off of a bad note with an ice cold shower over something that could easily be fixed. 

i offered to spend friday and saturday evenings with him, but have made it clear i'm going home every sunday afternoon. for a week i've stuck to this. 

he texted me this morning telling me that he's looking forward to seeing me today but that he thinks i'm being very overdramatic about the situation and need to get over it before i ruin our relationship over something ""so stupid"". so he thinks it's my fault. 

i plan to spend tonight and tomorrow with him and go home on sunday just like i did this week. 

aita?

tl;dr: i refused to stay with my boyfriend until he stops wasting all of the hot water in the morning. aita?",3
