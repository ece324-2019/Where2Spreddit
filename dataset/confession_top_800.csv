"i ghosted my boyfriend of 5 years.. i came over to his house one morning to surprise him with breakfast and a video game he wanted, only to find him naked, asleep, and  with his ex curled up in his arms.

he didn't hear me come in, so i closed his bedroom door, and left his breakfast and game on the kitchen counter along with my key to his house.

i went to my car, deactivated my facebook, and blocked him on all other forms of social media. i then called my phone provider to change my number before driving off.

i texted family members and close friends that we were no longer together and to block him on social media, as well. i didn't tell them why.

i was in a position to end the lease at my apartment early, and i started a new job in a different city later that week.

 i completely removed myself from him and didn't offer a shred of explanation or opportunity for dialogue. i disappeared from his life after his betrayal and i think it'll not only help me to focus on myself without his presence, but i think completely shutting myself off from him will hurt worse than anything when he thinks on how good he had it with me these last 5 years.",11
"i'm putting my extremely profoundly disabled 7 year old into a residential facility so i can forget he exists. i'm not sorry.. i can't tell anyone this, even my therapist. lambast me if you wanr and maybe i even deserve it. i only ask what you would do if you were in my situation. not what you think ""people should"" do. what you would really do. 

i'm a single mom of 2 boys. 12 and 7. my husband passed away 3 years ago in a work accident. a very large portion of me believe it was a suicide. i can't see him ever making the mistake he made that caused his death, and he had taken an action just before that which ensured his co-workers weren't in the room. i fully believe he killed himself because of our younger son and no one will ever change my mind. 

we were told when i was pregnant that he would have downs syndrome. we could handle that. even if it was severe. it turned out he has a chromosome deletion. his disorder is kind of rare so i won't post which specific one but suffice to say he'll never be anything more than he is now or has ever been. 

and what he is, is nothing. 

he doesn't appear to have any awareness and never has. his eyes are locked in one position, he doesn't respond to noise, touch, or pain. he is total care. he is capable of nothing. he is tube fed and on oxygen. he is in diapers and will be forever. he makes no sounds, no attempts to communicate. he never even really cried as a baby.

he has never made an attempt to interact with anyone or his environment. 

i'm not upset because i got a special needs/""imperfect"" child. i feel the way i feel because this...... thing..... takes up 200% of my time and does nothing. i didn't get an imperfect child. i didn't get *a child*. 

i don't love him. he doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. and yet i'm responsible for him. in addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his g tube, infections, pressure sores no matter what we put him on or how we position him. 

our older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. he's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. we do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. i was starting law school, i gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. my older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments. 

the final straw was i heard a sound. i went into younger son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw older son hitting him and screaming ""you're why i don't have a mother! you're why i don't have a father! you're why i can't have friends over! you're why i can't be in sports! i didn't ask for you and i hope you die!"" 

instead of being horrified, i watched. and younger son just did. not. react. no signs of pain or fear or upset. no reaction at all. 

he breathes but he is not alive. he doesn't know who i am. he doesn't know who older son is. he has no sense of self, life experience, or awareness of his surroundings. 

he doesn't need to be in my home. he doesn't know or care where he is. he is genetically my son but he is not family. my previously abused, brain damaged cat who can't walk straight has more personality and is far more loveable than my ""child"". in fact i was looking forward to raising a downs baby. even one with severe impairments, for that reason. with disability can come gifts. this boy is not a gift. he is a genetic mistake i probably should have miscarried and would have definitely terminated if i'd known he would be like this. and the flip side is, if he has awareness..... he's miserable. and there is nothing i can do. if he has likes and dislikes no one knows what they are. if he is in pain he can't tell anyone. if he wants anything, he can't communicate. he's had every imaginable therapy, nothing has made a difference. 

and so he's leaving our home on the 29th. i feel excited and relieved and then guilty because i know we'll be happier with him gone. 

he's already taken my husband and my son's father. he was working so so so much ot to pay for the cucumber's care. for the experimental therapies insurance wouldn't cover. because this one was going to be the breakthrough. he was tired and defeated and disappointed. he sought counseling as well but i don't think he could ever say the words ""i don't want my son in my home"" either. 

he's ruined my older son. i was so wrapped up on the younger i never realized how ignored and damaged he was. he lost his father too. i didn't just lose my husband. he is my priority now and this malignant lump can be someone else's problem. at least they'll be paid a wage to care for him. at least they'll get a break from him when they punch out. 

i just want to never think of him again and i'm not sorry. and for that, i'm sorry. 

thanks for reading.

edit: thanks /u/piconeeks, for calling me a liar. are you a medical doctor? if your google fu was any good you would have stumbled on 3p mosaic deletion-duplication syndrome. that is the disorder my son has. i've basically identified myself by posting that but hey, it's better than the pms telling me to kill myself. if you look at the features of 3p deletion syndromes *they look like downs*. my insurance didn't cover afp testing which would have told us it wasn't downs and i didn't think we needed it. i had a regular ultrasound and a 3d. both drs were ""99% sure it was downs"". 

this post was absolutely not fiction. instead the mods and especially /u/piconeeks just ""decided"" it was. 

if anyone would like i'll doxx myself. you can see my id to verify my name, my marriage license, and my husband's death certificate. i will then link you to the news article of the ""freak industrial accident"" that ended his life so you can see it's the same person. 

as for not choosing hospice for my son - i can't. about a year ago i myself was hospitalized with severe depression and c-ptsd (there is proof of that too). during that time my late husbands mother petitioned to get control as my son's medical proxy and got it. i'm fighting it but it's a long, complicated process. there are competency hearings. there are statements from doctors and evaluations. unless she oks hospice, which she refuses, i cannot decide that. i have custody. i cannot ake medical decisions. she agreed to residential care which i feel is the second best option. so, he's going into residential care. 

as for ""mistaking"" a child choking with hitting, i was downstairs. i couldn't hear what my older son was saying. i only knew he was speaking. go punch a blanket or, idk, a person with weak muscle tone. then ask said person with weak muscle done to cough. they don't cough normally/forcefully. it's more a ""strong puff"". similar to, again.... idk... a muted punch. when you're used to jumping at every strange sound, it's difficult to discern what's what sometimes. 

so, /u/piconeeks..... anything else you'd like to know? care to admit i *just might be* telling the truth? there were identify details i left out but guess y'all need them.",11
"i accidentally killed my brother.. throwaway because a lot of people know that this happened to me. i'm going to leave out a lot of detail too just so it can't be easily traced back to me. 

i'm just living with so much guilt. i need to get this out because it's hard to talk about with people that i know. 

when i was 10, i had a little brother who was 2 1/2. we spent a lot of time with our neighbors because our moms were friends and they had 4 kids around the ages of my siblings. one day, we were exploring in the wooded area behind our houses and i found a huge rock. it looked like it had smaller shiny rocks in it (it wound up being a piece of cement with metal shards in it) and i thought it was pretty and wanted to take it home. once we got back to our house though, our mom told us all to pack into the neighbors car as we were going to chuck e cheese. 

the rock was heavy so i brought it with us rather than lugging it home. my neighbors had one of those huge vans that sat like 15 people and had shelves above the seats so i put the rock in one of the selves (and struggled to do so, as it was so heavy). long story short, my baby brother sat below that shelf. at some point when the van stopped, the rock fell out of the shelf and crushed his little head. it wasn't super gory but it was bad enough to have killed him right away. right in front of my mom, me, my brother, sister, and our friends and their mom. at an intersection during a red light. 

i just remember my mom screaming ""where did that come from"" and ""oh god, my baby"" over and over again. it came out as a whisper at first but eventually i was about to choke out an audible ""me"" and i'll never forget the look on my moms face. it was a mixture of pure grief, knowing my brother was dead. anger, because i had done something so dumb that it resulted in the death of her youngest child. and compassion, because i know she wanted to hug me and tell me it wasn't my fault. but she couldn't at that time. she's regretted it for years and has apologized to me over and over but all she said at that moment was ""you killed your brother"". 

i'm 26 now and it's been 16 years since my brother died and i'm still in therapy. my family has assured me every day since that it wasn't my fault and nobody blames me and that's a sweet sentiment but it was still my fault. it was an accident but i still directly caused it. that sweet little baby is dead because of me and i can't escape it. watching my parents grieve like that was unbearable, and they still feel so much pain. 

i just can't stand the pain anymore. my whole life has been a wreck since then and i can't seem to get myself on track. i'm a high school drop out who has to leave work at least once a month because of my severe and constant panic attacks. i have full days where i'm paralyzed and can't get myself out of bed. i feel like i should be dead, and not my brother. 

if you read all of this, thank you. it was hard to write. i just need the universe to know that i haven't forgot what i've done, and i want everyone to know that i'm so sorry. i'll never forgive myself and i'll never forget.

"i kicked my son out of our house for being gay. he became an alcoholic and nearly drank himself to death.. this was in 1991, my son was 18 and going to a local college. me and my wife considered ourselves sort of a normal new jersey italian catholic family, we were traditional and fairly ignorant to most things. we hated the perceived feminization of culture, images of drag queens in nyc and aids and the tight pants of modern kids made us recoil in horror. 

my wife found gay porn magazines in my sons room. i came home to a shit storm, she was freaking out at him, i asked why and she showed me what it was. i felt my heart drop down into my stomach, it was like a punch to the gut. he was *gay*? it felt like the ultimate betrayal to us, betraying our religion, betraying the normal, 'healthy' upbringing we gave him. we had zero concept of the idea of being born gay, we thought it was something you made a choice to engage in, and once you did it you couldn't stop. everything that we had given him, a normal, religious, traditional home, with enough money to go to college and relative freedom to do what he wants, and he just threw it all away. at least, that is what i thought at the time. he was my only precious thing in the world, my son, the person who would inherit my families name, the man who i raised from a child to be a man, but at that moment was the furthest thing from a real man in my mind i could imagine. i made the choice right then and there that he was no son of mine, he was just a sissy bitch who happened to live in my house. 

i know how horrific this sounds, because it was horrific. and it was how almost everyone who lived in our community felt. we were constantly spewed with propaganda to hate gay people and ideas that the youth were all gay and experimenting and getting aids and dressing as women. the hair metal, men wearing makeup, david bowie, the drag queens in new york across the hudson, freddy mercury, the ridiculous clothing of the era, it all gave the worldview that the world was turning into some gay, womanly wonderland. 

anyways, i barely even spoke to him. my wife was the one who did all the yelling. i just went red in the face and couldn't even look at him. she told him to get the fuck out and go to new york to live with his friends, who she assumed were all gay (and she was right, mostly). she physically hit him, a lot, and got him to pack his stuff while he was crying and told him to get out. 

me and my wife were just devastated afterwards, we went to church a lot, my wife told all the other families in the area and they were horrified at my son. i remember when we told our priest, who was a very nice, accepting man, about our son he looked to be disgusted, but when we told him we kicked him out he looked at us in disgust, or at least hided it a tiny bit. living without my son hurt. it also made me rethink things over time. i still saw him almost as a inhuman person, to be gay, to me at that time, was so sinful and horrific that it was impossible to truly consider accepting them as real, normal people. 

me and my wife grew apart in the 6 months following my son leaving. she started to drink a lot, and she was a nasty drunk. she had a history of alcoholism, i knew how bad it could get. this was the worst i had ever seen her. we fought constantly over stupid things, and all i could think about was that when our son was here, we never fought, he always calmed us down. 

in the end, i got kicked out of my own home, she just told me to leave. i moved to new york to live with my brother in bay ridge, we got divorced officially a few months later. she would die from liver failure 7 years later. 

i made the choice, a conscious choice, to find out where my son was. at that point my life was just in shambles and i was rethinking everything about how i viewed my religion, my life, and i was just so horribly depressed and lonely. finding him was a nightmare of itself, it took two weeks of calling homeless shelters and asking around at them if they had seen my son months ago. i finally found him in an apartment in williamsburg. i saw him and apologized, and i told him that i am so sorry i kicked him out. part of me was still in the same mindset as before, i was still a raging homophobe, but i tried to push that part away and just be with my son and ignore everything else. 

he was a severe alcoholic. my first thought when i saw him, sweaty and skinny and sickly looking, was aids. but no, it was alcoholism. it runs in the family. he said that it started soon after i kicked him out, and that he was horribly depressed and turned to drinking heavily. even his roommates said it was a major problem. 

for the next 3 months i spent a lot of time focusing on getting him clean. i met his friends, about half of whom were gay, and we worked together to help him. he went to a detox clinic, he went to rehab. we spent a lot of emotional days together. i didn't want to lose him, even though just a year before i was desperate to get rid of him. the thought of him dying, right after this... because we kicked him out... it was just too much to bear. i made the decision that if he died, i would probably commit suicide after. but he would get clean, then relapse 4 months later, then get clean again for 2 years, then relapse again. then he quickly recovered. and he would never touch another drop again. 

spending that time with my son, and seeing how he lived and more importantly actually seeing how these gay men lived their lives, mostly completely normally, it completely changed me as a human being. in 1996, i went to my first pride parade with my son to support him and his boyfriend at the time. i took a heavy interest in the lgbt community and went with my son to visit his friends in aids clinics. if you were to have told me in 1991 that i would be going to an aids clinic with a drag queen and being friendly with everyone by 1997, i wouldn't believe you in the slightest. 

anyways this post has been days in the making. i love reddit even if i am a bit old for it haha. i have told my story before to a journalist and it was published. if you feel deja vu reading this, i would very much prefer if you didn't reveal my identity on this post or post the article.

"cop pulled me over and i called 911 and lied to get out of going to jail.. when i was 19 i was running late to work in my tiny pos economy car and on fumes of gas i didn't come to a complete stop on a right turn. lights behind me so i pull over. i know i've barely got any gas at all and was almost to a gas station, hence why i rolled through the stop a little. trying not to have the car die. 

at the time (around 1995) a new digital phone had come out called voicesteam (now tmoblie) and their whole big thing was the phones were digital and not cellular. they were the first phones with caller id and one of the big things the salesman had said over and over was since it was digital the signal couldn't be triangulated or traced. not that i cared but it stuck in my mind. 

well as i give the cop my license, registration and insurance card i got an idea. i knew if i was late to work i was going to lose my job. they were super strict there. 

so i get an idea and right after i hand the papers to the cop and he's walking back to his cruiser i called 911 and tell the operator i just saw a guy with what looked like a shot gun walk into a 7-11 that was about 2 blocks away. i confirmed the address then i hung up. 

about 30 seconds later the cops comes sprinting to my car and hands me all my stuff and rushed says, ""come to a complete stop next time!!"" then peels off to the direction of the store. 

pushed my car to the gas station that i'd almost made it to and felt pretty pleased with my ingenuity. 

i was an idiot and i confess!

edit: wow, this blew up.  i forgot to mention i would have gotten arrested, booked and released, because i was driving with a suspended license for unpaid traffic tickets and i had a bench warrant for it.  because i'm an idiot!

so it wouldn't have been just a few mins late to work. the job was a physical high turn over one that didn't tolerate much.

thank you to the kind souls giving me these medals/awards!  don't think i deserve them but i'll pass it along to those who do!",11
"i used to bully my disabled brother for years. update:

a lot of people were asking for an update so here it is.

i wrote up a long ass apology letter that i wanted to read to my brother. i waited until he got home and got into bed for the night.

i knocked on his door and he was so fucking excited that it was me. i couldn't even get through the first few words. i started crying after saying ""i wanted to say i'm really sorry"" and just couldn't get through it.

i just got into bed with him and laid down next to him. he hugged me really tight and said ""i missed you buddy"".

i fucking lost it. i never cried that bad before. he just hugged me for a long time until i calmed down. we didn't talk much. he started crying for a bit too. it was the first time in a long time we just hugged. after half an hour i got up and gave him a kiss and he told me he was so happy. why didn't i do this earlier, fuck.

i thought i could i try apologizing properly again tomorrow. i left him the note to read anyway.

i am feeling very hopeful right now and a lot of pressure in my heart is gone. i swear to god and on my own life i will never treat my brother so badly again.

i have been working part-time for the past year and i was saving some money so my brother and my mom could go on a trip to a place he really wanted to go to. but i think i will take my brother myself instead (when i turn 18).

i also realized that i need to have a relationship with my brother where i am not just taking care of him. it needs to be like a normal brother relationship. like going for movies and stuff. it's going to take some time for me to fix the mess i created though. i'm just lucky my brother is amazing.

i received a lot of messages. i appreciate everyone for their input and i did read them all even if i didn't reply. thanks everyone.




my actual post:

remorse


i know this will get a lot of hate and yes i deserve it. i am not looking for any validation or forgiveness. i know i am a piece of human trash.

i just need to get this out.

i have a brother who is two years older then me. he has suffered from a condition since birth that forces him to be in a wheelchair anytime he is out of bed. he cannot use his arms that well either.

we used to have a great relationship until i turned 11 and i really started resenting the amount of attention he took from my parents. and how much stress he put them under.

i had to constantly help him, change him, feed him. i hated it.

there was a few years in his life when he so mean to my parents and it really made me resent him more.

i realize now that i had no right to judge him and i will never know how difficult life is for him.

i stopped hanging out with him and made more friends at school. i would tell my family all the fun i was having at school during dinner to make him feel bad.

i started barely talking to him or acknowledge his presence. he would get frustrated to the point of tears to get my attention.

it started escalating two years ago when i would purposely turn off the wifi and unplug the tv every time we had to leave the house so my brother could do nothing but sit in his wheelchair.

i would purposely delete his favorite saved shows on the dvr. i would make fun of his speech. push things just out of his reach.

i would act disgusted when i had to change or bathe him. it always made him feel bad and he would apologize. i made my own brother apologize for taking a dump. what the fuck is wrong with me?

but my fucking saint of a brother never told my parents. and he never let me have it.

three weeks ago, he was trying to talk to me non-stop and i was just ignoring him. i got annoyed and wheeled him against his wishes to the backyard and placed him under an umbrella and went back inside. i fell asleep and realized i left him out there for three hours.

when i went to bring him back inside he was in tears and wouldn't look at me. he was humiliated. 

i have always felt guilty about how i treated my brother all these years but my anger towards him overpowered it. but seeing that look on his face affected me in a way that was different from before.

i stopped all the bullying after that day. i couldn't even look him in the face i was so ashamed.

last sunday my brother told me he was glad i was his brother and friend. i couldn't even respond. i went to my room and cried.

i'm fucking crying again typing this all out. when did i become an evil trash human being? fuck.

i'm 17 and he's 19 now. i know there is nothing i can do to make up for the past 6 years.

my brother will be returning with my mom from a specialist appointment tonight. i'm going to apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness tonight. i want to start being being a fucking decent brother to him again.

i am a healthy guy with no issues who chose to bully his only brother for something that wasn't even his fault. i am so ashamed of myself.",11

just did bullet form for brevity 

got a new job about three months ago from a competitor of my old employer. decent pay increase as a project manager, fortune 300

when getting hired, was told my team was getting assembled, and was given some prelim work to do but was warned it may be a week or two. cool with me, got me time to get acclimated

i complete the work a lot sooner than expected, and, after asking my boss if there was anything to do and being told ""not yet"" sit on my thumbs for a few days, assuming hr will be in touch with the status of the hires

about a month goes by, and still nothing. i try to be helpful, e-mailing other managers asking if they needed a second eye on anything, and asking my boss/a few people under me if they need help on any projects, yet no long term goal can be found and for the most part i essentially do nothing but play on my phone and day trade. (i have my own office).

i check in weekly with a member of hr, alternating between a few as to not piss them off, but hear little back.

eventually, my boss retires, and the new interim guy is from another department, i'm friendly with him, but its clear he's a bit over his head, so i figured i'd wait a few days to let him know my situation. eventually though, he comes into my office to ""thank me"" for doing good work on the initial pre setup i had done a month ago. after that, he essentially leaves me to my own devices. at this point, i had written close to a dozen e-mails to hr, and even my bosses boss, but always got non committal responses. eventually due to learned response i kind of give up and just figure someone will tell me eventually.

it's now been close to three months and outside of extremely minor favor tasks and my initial pre planning, i've essentially done nothing, and have not been asked what i'm doing once. i occasionally walk around the production floor with a clipboard taking notes so i'm seen, but i seriously feel like even if i didn't no one would notice. my new boss doesn't seem to realize i'm one of his workers, and essentially leaves me alone, lost in the shuffle of a huge company.

a bit annoying, but i'm not complaining and i have documented proof of me trying to fix this situation. until someone notices though, i'm happy playing words with friends and day trading while getting 35 an hour",11

"i've been replacing my wife's coffee with decaf for 4 years. my wife and i have been married for 4 years.

when we met she was a tiny little terror. like the tasmanian devil had a baby with barbie. so freaking adorable and sweet, but she was a tornado. she drank like 6 cups of coffee every single day. so much caffeine for a tiny person. if you didn't know her you would swear she was on drugs. i loved her so much that i knew i could put up with it if i had to, but if i didn't have to, i would try to find a way. so the month before our wedding i decided to try replacing her coffee with decaf for to see if it made a change. and lord have mercy, it was incredible. it was hell the first two weeks. she had the biggest attitude and was so crabby, but i knew we could make it through it. afterwards it was the best! she was still sweet, and spunky, and adorable, but she wasn't leaving a trail of destruction behind her anymore. i was amazed! so i decided that from that moment on, i would no longer supply her with regular coffee. i would make every starbucks run, i would buy regular and decaf ground coffee so i could replace the regular coffee in the package with decaf coffee. the only time she has regular coffee is when she orders it herself, which is like maybe once a week. but it makes her really jittery and she doesn't understand why. it's been this way for 4 years. she has no idea, and i am hoping to keep it that way. we are talking about having kids in the next year or so, so i'm hoping that i can convince her to go full decaf on her own at that time and then i won't have to keep this up anymore.",11

the way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. so if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. my manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards. 

so my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when i was closing i found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. they were filled with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. so, i scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. after we closed, i came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. i counted them. there were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. none of them had expiration dates. total haul was $40k in fast food certificates. 
my manager never said a word, he couldn't. he had reported them destroyed weeks earlier. 

over the next three years my girlfriend and i toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. we never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half. 

after the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up. 

i bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change.
and for some reason a kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. we threw away a lot of kiddie cones. 

edit:

holy crap this blew up.  here are the answers to some of the faqs

1. we could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours.  both of us would use a gift cert.  it was not that labor intensive.  


2. the only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window.  


3. the manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently.  


4. each gift certificate had a generic plu on them.  e.i. all the $25 were plu #756.

5.  when we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid.  they were not coupons.  

6.  one can only eat so many ice cream cones.  ",11
i thought i was a pretty good dad until i was tested. my son threw a snowball at me and i instinctively blocked it with my daughter. the look of betrayal on her snow covered face has haunted my dreams for years,11
"my son beat up another boy and i'm so proud of him.. so my son was being bullied pretty badly at school. people would make fun of his accent, use racial slurs towards him, throw open milk cartons at him at lunch, start rumors about him, they put his book bag in the toilet once, and a bunch of fucked shit kids do to each other. my son had told on the main perpetrator to me and his mother and i went to the school and told them about my concerns and the school gave him a stern talking to which only stopped him for a few weeks and then he continued to bully my son. so i went to the school and complained again and the administration had told me that they spoke to the kid and he had told them that he was just joking and he didnt mean any of the stuff he was saying and that they were actually friends anyway the assistant principal told me that ""boys will be boys"" and that it was not out of the ordinary for boys to make fun of each other, but since the kid had admitted to doing it they gave him in-school suspension which is essentially a slap on the wrist. so after that i realized that nothing was going to happen if i kept running back to the administration every time my son came home crying so i took matters into my own hands. (now im going to tell you something about me. in my home country i was an amateur boxer but due to the financial situation i was in, my mother did not want me to box she wanted me to work and study, so i cut a deal with her if i made that if to the olympics i would go pro after but if i failed i would stop and work and go to university. anyway i failed and stopped boxing and got a job and finished my studies.) ok so what i did was taught my son how to fight. everyday after i get home from work for the past 9 months i take him to the local boxing gym and taught him how to hit the bag, throw combinations, taught him about foot work and movement, how to work the speed bag, how to dodge, hit the pads and everything i else i knew from my old days as a boxer. it worked wonders for my son not only did he become physically stronger, he also became mentally strong, he stopped coming home crying, he started to make friends and it had a real positive effect on him. when i would ask him if he was still getting bullied he said it didnt bother him what people he didnt care about said about him, so i figured that was the end of the bully problem, i was wrong. two weeks ago i get a call from school that my son had gotten into a fight and that i had to go pick him up because he and the other boy were both suspended for 5 days for fighting. when i go to pick my son up he is covered in blood, which was alarming at first but then he told me that it was not his blood it was the other boy, the one who put his bag in the toilet kept walking up to him and using racial insults towards him and my son told him if he didnt stop he was going to beat him up, and he kept his promise. turns out my son broke the other kids nose, busted his lip and hit the other kids eye and it had swollen shut. my son has some bruises on his face but nothing compared to the other kid. now my son has been getting yelled at alot by his mother, she made him write and apology letter to the boy, the boys parents, to the principal, to the teacher, to the security guard who broke it up and she is really mad at me and blames me for this because i taught him how to fight but i honestly could not be more proud of him. he's getting whatever he wants for christmas from me. sorry for the horrible grammar english is not my first language. no regrets",11
"ive been on the run for 7 and a half years.. i stopped reporting to my parole officer in 2011. i recently had a beautiful baby. tomorrow i'm turning myself in. can't be a father if i'm a wanted man. i have 12 years hanging over my head. i've never experienced abject terror before today. i'll never be able to say that sentence again. i'm not even sure why i'm posting. i have a great support network, but i'm still terrified. of the consequences. of losing everything. of missing the beginning of my child's life. i don't fear prison. prison is actually the easiest part of all this. when i went to prison the first time, i just didn't care. now i have everything to lose. i'm stepping off a cliff with no idea where i'll land...

edit: there has been concern that i'm going to prison for 12 years. for clarity 12 years is how much parole i have left. under state law 6 is the max i can receive. more likely it will be 1-3 based on several factors. no new charges, turning myself in, new child.

i commented this but wanted to post it up top so people would see them. 

jesus christ on a motorbike i didn't expect this to blow up the way it did.

first i want to address the ""you deserve what you get"" and ""you're a terrible person"" crowd. trust me. i'm more aware of those facts than you could ever be. i was a coward. until i walk through those doors tomorrow, i still am a coward. i am a piece of shit. but with the family and friends i have on my side, i won't be for long.

for all the folks wishing me luck, sending me messages, and generally showing empathy to a man undeserving: thank you from every piece of my heart. sometimes the internet's not such a bad place.

as for updates. my brother has expressed that he is willing to post them from this account over the next few weeks as the process works itself out. so it won't be me directly, but they'll be here.

finally. to answer a couple common questions:

1. ""how did you make it seven years?"" i didn't break the law, kept my head down, and was, for all intents and purposes, barring the absconding, a model citizen. no one ever had a reason to question me.

2. ""why not stay on the run?"" this may be hard for someone on the outside to understand, but the life i currently live is a life of constant fear. a purgatory. a half life. my daughter has made me see that i need more. i need freedom. which may seem contrary to going to prison, but jail or prison is just the first step in a longer game plan. one that sees me as a real model citizen, the best father i can be, and lord willing, the best husband a woman could hope for.

3. ""what were your crimes?"" like i've mentioned, i am actively avoiding specificity, but the long and short is i committed several crimes over several weeks, and it culminated in me fighting a cop and hurting him when he tried to arrest me.

4. ""have you ever talked to the cop and apologized?"" i have not. i hope to one day, but first thing first is getting my shit together. an apology from an on the run convicted criminal doesn't mean much.

5. ""what about your wife/woman?"" i am hopeful. she seems committed to helping me through this. i hope to make us work. but if time has other plans she will always have my love and respect. both as the mother of my child and the woman who helped me to grow into the kind of man that's ready to face his failures and grow as a human, and a parent.

that's all i got for now. i might add a final note before i go in tomorrow. if not my brother will update when new news is to be had.

update: this is my final update for a while. in 20 minutes my attorney is driving me to county. i'm currently holding my daughter while my lady hammers out some details with the lawyer. thank you all for the well wishes. as strange as it is reddit has given me more of the strength i need to do this. the internet sometimes comes through for you. excuse me for now. i need to cuddle my daughter for the last few minutes i can...",11
"i regret having my child. throwaway for obvious reasons.

i was married for 15 years to my high school sweetheart.  we had two beautiful kids (13 & 9).  for many reasons, we divorced.

skip to me starting to date again a year later.  i meet an amazing woman almost right away (first month of dating again).  we have a ton in common.  we fall in love very quickly.  she tells me early on that she wants kids.  i had never wanted more kids.  two was more than enough for me.  i had even made an appointment to get snipped later that year.  but this woman is perfect for me, and having kids is a dealbreaker for her.  so i decide i could do this all again - for her, for us.  

i'm approaching 40 when we finally start trying.  due to some health complications (she's over 35, and has high blood pressure), we ended up having to do ivf.  it worked, and we were pregnant soon afterwards.  but...

our son was born prematurely (they warned us this was a possibility due to her age/health).  he had to stay in the nicu for three months.  my new wife developed post partum due to the stress.  we found out our son had cerebral palsy.  a milder form, but he had it.  our world shifted from being a happy couple with a new baby to a depressed and stressed couple dealing with a child that has a life long disability.  this is not how i perceived my second chance at happiness was going to be.

i won't leave my wife.  and i will love and take care of our son forever.  but not a day goes by where i don't regret my decision to have more kids.  i should have listened to my gut from the beginning and called off the relationship early on.  she wanted kids, and i didn't.   but i did this for her.  now i'm depressed, financially strained, and my future isn't the relaxing one i pictured.  i can never tell my wife this of course.  and i feel bad even writing this to you all of you.  but i just needed to get it out.

edit:  thank you for the gold.  i'm humbled.",11
"i overcharged over 5,000 people.. back in high school i used to work the concession stand. in my school the booth was a little folding table where i would sell water, pop and chips. 

to anyone that was a visiting team i would charge $.25-.50 more on the items they wanted to buy, and i would keep it. 

i ended up making somewhere around $3,000 doing this for my high school career, and no one ever found out because i didn't charge anyone from the home team the same amount. ",11
"confession: i'm on the internet right now. i'm born, brought up and live in a cult so this is confession worthy.. i'm supposed to be posting and marketing products the sect makes online, and one of my mothers checks the search history nightly, but everyone is too dumbed down to realize that incognito is a thing. so when everyone is gone doing work and i'm made to post the listings on the internet, i will go on incognito and browse reddit and world news and twitter feeds and whatever else. 

i'm 19. 

if they found out i would definitely not be left with so much freedom and i'd be punished, yeah. even if i'm now a adult by the governments order, i'm still pushed in the group of being a child, so i'd probably get a serious beating.

i'm actually really lonely and empty all of the time. for the people who post their information and pictures and lifes on reddit, you really do a lot for me and it helps me get through these days.

thank you so much

"i slept with my daughters ex boyfriend, he got me pregnant and i had an abortion. they got back together and got married.. this was back in... let me think, maybe 1997? i was 38 and my daughter was 18, and she was dating harry, who was 24. i was an alcoholic and dabbled in other drugs, mostly cocaine. i was not a good person, let alone mother. not like i was abusive to my daughter or anything but i was generally inattentive and cared more about my alcohol and drugs than her, especially in her teen years. i am 14 years sober now. 

i disproved of my daughter dating harry, but i never told her why. he would flirt with me, constantly, and the age difference also creeped me out. also, he was an alcoholic and drug user, just like me. she broke up with him over his alcoholism. 

soon after she moved away, not too far but regardless she didn't live with me anymore. harry kept calling me and asking if we wanted to get drinks, i turned him down, but then one day he said he had a bunch of coke and i couldn't resist. he came over, we did the coke, and we ended up having sex. he was a very good looking guy. he looked a lot like that ridiculous 80s justin beiber picture that was on the front page today, that is actually what made me think about him. 

for the next few months, maybe like 3-4 months, he would sometimes come over and we would have sex and do drugs and get drunk together. any drug addict knows what that is like to have a drug addict buddy in that way. 

then i got pregnant. i knew it was by him, i had sex without a condom a few times stupidly. i never told him i was pregnant, and i went and got the abortion and kept it a secret. 

anyways, i stopped seeing him after that, it was too weird. i also got sober, for like 4 months, before relapsing. fast forward 2 years and my daughter contacts me and tells me that she got back with harry, and that he is fully sober. i was mortified honestly. he was gonna tell her that we slept together, and she is going to hate me for life. they came over one day and said hi, and when my daughter was gone, harry told me that there is no reason to tell her about what happened. i agreed. 

its been 16 years of marriage on their part. they have a kid together. harry got cancer, then beat it. i got sober. that's basically it. 

i don't see them very often, they live in texas and i live on the east coast. but whenever i do there is always that tension between me and harry, its literally the first thing that comes to either of our minds, i can just tell. not like sexual tension, like ""why did we have to do that? what the fuck is wrong with us?"" kind of tension. 

i think about this often. especially when i see my grandson. i always think that could have been my son if things had gone differently, but wow what a disaster that would have been if i decided to keep that child. ",11
"i killed an elderly man in front of his wife and basically his entire family.. forgive me for any misspellings or format i'm trying to do this on my phone.  i haven't talked about this to anyone (even though it's been years) even my closest of friends, minus the ones that were there.

one nite when i was in college i was driving to get some liquor for a party my fraternity was supposed to throw the following night.

i was taking a street i was very familiar with to get back to my house.  it was dark but the street was lit with street lamps.  i remember that i looked at my radio for a second, just a second not very long at all.  but when i looked back up to the road  there was a man crossing.

i didn't have any time to react, by the time i saw him he had already hit the good of my car and bounced off the side.  i remember screaming and hitting the brakes, and the wash of horror of what had just happened.  i'll admit i had thought about speeding away, but i pulled over to the side and ran out of my car to check on this guy.

when i got to him his family was standing outside the restaurant he was leaving and they were all screaming and crying.  he has laying on the side of the road with blood coming out his nose and mouth. two other men were standing with him trying to see if he was alright and calling 911.  all i could say was ""i didn't see him"" i was frantic by the time it had set in what i had done.

i sat on the curb across from the family and listened to their crying in agony while we waited for the paramedics to arrive.  i sat there and sobbed while to paramedics took him away in an ambulance.  i don't believe i've ever cried so hard and for so long.  the worst part about all of it and what still kills me today was that his wife came over to me while i was distraught on that curb, sat next to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said ""i was married to him for almost 50 years.  we had a good life."" then she hugged me and said that she forgave me.


  after everything was said and done it was ruled that it was an accident.  i wasn't charged with anything and i had one of my friends pick me up from the police station.  i went down a dark path the years after that.  i drank heavily, dropped out of college in my senior year, and had to move back in with my mother and father because i couldn't hold on to a job.  even tried to kill myself with pills.  it was a hard road to recovery (witch i feel i'm not fully recovered from nor do i feel i ever will be the same). but eventually i got my life back in order.  joined up with the navy and saw a bit of the world, and now i'm on track to go back to college and hopefully finish what i started there.   it took almost a decade but i finally start to feel almost whole again.  i'm back to hanging with my friends, and actually going out.  so maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

wow, you guys are awesome! thanks for the support and feedback.  i've never really posted anything on reddit before because people can be assholes, but all these kind words are moving. thank you!
and big thanks to whoever reformatted my post.  i'm shit at this so thanks homie!",11
"found out my dead best friend was in love with my wife. light

i'm writing this as a confession because i don't know where else to speak about this and i don't want my kids finding this out on my main account.

my friend died a few months back due to heart problems. he was taking care of himself so it was a shock to everyone. especially his wife who was with him at their house when he died. due to this she decided to move somewhere else and because she and her daughter were still distraught she asked me to pack up his stuff.

he had some boxes in his basement and after a while i started feeling nostalgic and decided to look into them. i found pictures of us from when we were kids all the way to before we got married. that was enough to make me feel bad and i just got back to taping them up. 

but one of the boxes seemed to be in much better condition, so i decided to check it in case it was something important. to my surprise i found out pictures of him and my wife from when we used to hang out together, as well as more recent pictures from family reunions. the most recent being from my wife's birthday party. 

alongside the pictures there were letters that he never sent her. the first one dated 2 months before i met her. the last one was also the same date of her birthday party. there was one that stood out the most was one from after i started dating her. he wrote that his time had passed and since my happiness was as important as his own he would watch over us.

i'll keep his box safe since it isn't my secret to reveal.",11
"i'm the guy stealing your ashtray off your porch every couple nights.. throwaway because a lot of people know my real reddit.

for the past 3 months i have hit a rough patch. barely making my rent which is $480 a week, barely making my bills. can barely afford cigarettes. (cigarettes in australia cost roughly $25 for a pack of 20's)

a neighbour of mine is an outdoor smoker, he lives in an apartment building just a block away. he has been filling large jars up with his cigarette butts and keeping them in the jar at his front door, the first time i stole it the next day he had already put out an identical jar, i let that fill up for a few days and then i stole that one too. this repeated two more times.

the fifth jar he put out, funny enough literally the next day. was also identical except this one had the message ""please bring back jar :)"" a lot of people would be disgusted that someone is stealing their ashtray but whoever lives in this house obviously knows what it means to be broke.

i listened to whoever it was and after i stole the ashtray with the message on it, i grabbed all the jars i had from my his house and brought them back to his doorstep. ever since then, he has been leaving me half cigarettes in the ashtray, our routine is, he smokes, fills it up, i take it home, and bring back the jar i had taken recently.

it's literally now a whole system.... two jars constantly in rotation between us both. and we have never even met each other, or seen each other before.

tl;dr: starting stealing ashtrays off my neighbour, now we have a whole system together where he supplies half cigarettes for me every couple days.

edit: i wrote a long note including the link to this reddit post and put it in one of his ashtrays and put it outside his doorstep. its nearly 4am in melbourne so it was perfect timing.",11
"once a year i book a lodge out in the middle of nowhere and take lsd despite having schizophrenia.. every year at the start of november i book a lodge in the middle of nowhere for a week. i am 32 years old and have schizophrenia and have done this for the past 6 years. i'm on treatment (medication and therapy) all year except the 3 days leading up to my adventure and for the week itself. i do this without anybody knowing because i know i'd get a lecture which i completely understand why. usually my psychosis and break from reality is very negative and scary that's why i comply with medication on the most part. but every time i've taken lsd i've had nothing but fantastic, intriguing and amazing experiences. i love taking it and stepping into a different reality not the reality i live in or the reality i face when psychotic, a reality where everything is beautiful and bliss. the things i take back from these experiences has helped me so much. obviously i understand the risks of taking lsd as a schizophrenic, on my trip i'm sure to bring high dose antipsychotics and sedatives if i ever need to use them. but when i take the drug i find myself in a place like no other, everything has meaning and beauty. colours and wildlife are fascinating to look at. the adventures that happen are incredible, i really find my true self and are content with life. i'll never tell anybody i know about this because they wouldn't understand and i'll never share the experience with anybody else because this is really a time to find me and experience paradise.",11

yesterday he destroyed his group project, causing everyone in his group to fail. (although i'm giving more time for the rest of his group to re-make all of their lost work)

the kid got roughed up and had to go home early while every soul at the class is silent shut about any ""suspects"" but i believe that everyone in the class knew about this for some time now.

"my aunt hit my mother so i dragged her across the floor and punched her till she passed out. my aunt is a poisonous woman. our whole family doesn't talk to her. she's done things in the past you wouldn't believe. so she left our lives years ago. recently she returned out of the blue at my moms house. my mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. my mom and aunt never got on. my mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance. 

my aunt was nasty and would hurt people's feeling intentionally for no reason. she never had a partner or kids. she isolated herself from everyone. my gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. we all genuinely think there's something physiologically wrong with her. 

so back to where i was going with this....one morning i was at my moms house. just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. so i opened it and there she was. she walked in, she looked like she had took drugs. she looked dead behind the eyes. i tried to stop her but she pushed me down. i honestly don't know why she came to my moms house out of everyone. i quickly got up and she went into the kitchen she startled my mom and punched her in the face, my mom didn't even have a chance to blink before she hit her. she went down like a ton of bricks.

my heart felt like it had been sucked through into my stomach when i seen it. something came over me, i don't know if it was anger or adrenaline, but i ran up behind her and grabbed her hair and i dragged her out onto the back lawn and i bashed her face about 15 times, blood was everywhere. thankfully no one seen me or i might not of been writing this right now. i got up and i left her there. i went to check my mom, she was in a lot of pain. i looked back out the window and she was gone. 

we told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. i'm still so hurt and angry as i write this. but i also feel tremendously guilty and upset that i done that to her because i've never fought anyone and i'm not a fighter at all, but something came over me and i snapped. 

i can't get over it for some reason. it just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. god forbid she had a weapon that's truly scary to think about. we didn't call the police. as i assaulted her badly and didn't want it to bounce back on me. that's another thing i feel ashamed about.

but should i feel bad or not? i need others opinions as i've been bottling this up for a while.  

my gran was devastated, she just wanted her daughter back but from a young age she took to drugs, spent time in prison and amount of other things. you can't help someone who doesn't want to be saved. ",11

"i gave a lactose intolerant customer dairy on purpose. i know this sounds weird but when i worked at starbucks, there was a regular customer that was very difficult and rude. i was warned of this customer on my first day of training. she came in every morning and would try to rush the workers on doing their job and makes other customers feel uncomfortable. 3 months into working, she came in one morning and caused absolute hell. she was complaining about her drink while one of my coworkers was making the drink. as soon as she got it she accidentally ""spills"" it and asks for a completely different drink. i was so fed up. she wanted a frappuccino. she went to the bathroom while we were making the new order. i switched with my coworker and made the drink. instead of almond milk i made the frappuccino with regular milk. the drink was ready by the time she left the bathroom. she takes the drink and takes a sip and didn't complain. 5 hours later she calls the starbucks from the hospital and i was the one who picked up. she got in a car accident trying to rush to a bathroom. she said she shitted her pants. i couldn't be anymore happier that she was safe but got her karma.",11
"i held my boyfriend at gunpoint over a 8 hour period. i wanted to pull the trigger.. i was not in a good mental spot. it wasn't some big epic fight that started it. we had a disagreement and i flipped. i didn't black out, i was fully aware of my actions.

we were in a happy relationship, at that point 3 years in. i woke up one day and we had a little arguement over something i don't even remember now. he tried walking away to let me cool off and i lost it. i grabbed my gun, told him we were going to talk. i loaded it and held him at gunpoint in our bedroom for about 8 hours. i had never been violent before, no warning signs etc. he talked me out of it and instead of calling the police he got me the help i needed through medical professionals. 

i was diagnosed with ptsd, social anxiety and depression (possible stemming from the ptsd). 

he was there for me every step of the way, and the guilt i feel will never go away from my actions. life could of gone such a different way if i pulled the trigger. this was 10 years ago, and we are married and have 2 beautiful children. looking at us now, no one would imagine what happened. we never told anyone, and he stood by me at my darkest moment. 

mental health problems are real. instead of locking me away, and running for the hills he helped me when i needed it the most. the resulting life we are living together is more then i could have ever imagined. ",11
"i used to steal tons of food from my old job by pretending to be a customer ordering food and then calling 30 minutes later asking to cancel it. i used to work at this restaurant and the management there was just awful and the gm was just very verbally abusive. she always would complain about everything and one thing specifically was how there would be 1 or 2 customers who would order food and then never show up, she ended up letting the servers and hosts eat the food. so it gave me an idea. 
one day she said something that really pissed me off, so i called my job and ordered a bunch of food under a different name and then that ""customer"" would never show up. it made her livid and it gave me the bold idea of doing that whenever i want a lunch. i started to do it an hour or so before my break and i would order whatever i felt like eating that day and when they'd call and cancel i'd ask a supervisor if i could have the food and they'd say sure. 
i did this for the entire 3 years that i worked there 2 times a week, sometimes even 3. i didn't ever get caught , and i've even had a coworker help me by being the one to answer the phone. it was kinda funny and that place was awful, so i kinda deserved it.

edit: i should also add that this was a chain restaurant worth millions of dollars. i would never do something like this to a small or family owned restaurant. also i know i'm wrong for stealing, i was 16 and was trying to piss off my gm for the time i was there.",11
"after 13 years clean and 8 years of marriage, i did heroin 3 weeks ago and almost came close to fully relapsing.. i was a heroin addict in the lower east side of manhattan in the 1990s as a teen. i got clean at 21 years old after years of abuse. i got married at 26 to my amazing and beautiful wife. she knows i was an addict. 

i spent all these years not even really thinking that much about the concept of relapsing. it had been *so long*. i still thought about it, but with marriage and my kids and everything the thought of it was just so ridiculously out of sight to even consider trying it again. 

3 weeks ago, it was my friends birthday. he is 4 years younger than me so of course he wants to go to some cool hip sketchy bar/club thing in bushwick. 

i got drunk, really drunk. i hadn't really drank much at all in the past few years so my tolerance was way lower than expected. there was a dealer outside and a few other junkies nearby. i don't even fully remember what happened, i just remember going with them, abandoning my friend at the bar (it was like 1am anyways), and going to some apartment and shooting up. i spent the night there, then all the way until noon the next day. i had 10 missed calls. 

i panicked when i came out of my daze. i told my wife i had gotten way too drunk and was puking and my phone was out of battery so i stayed at charlies house. she was disappointed i didn't tell her but also thought it was funny because she used to tease me for not being able to handle my liquor. this was a ""i told you so"" moment, she had told me not to drink too much before i went to the bar. she wasn't even in new york, she was at a summer house with the kids in massachusetts. 

i spent the next 4 days until they got back just... riddled with anxiety, urges to get more heroin, horrific mind zaps (i dont even know what to call them). it was, in some ways, worse than my withdrawal symptoms when i first was an addict. not because of the physical feeling, but the horrible mental feeling of what i was possibly giving up, my wife and kids. i wanted to fucking get more so badly. i left my house to find heroin 4 fucking times. 4 times, i gave up to get more, but wasn't able to find any and snapped back to reality and went back home. i still thank fucking god i did not somehow run into some street dealer during those 4 times. i would have absolutely done it. 

i feel like everything i thought about myself, that i was strong, that my addiction was behind me, that i had beat heroin... it was all gone. i am not going to say i am back at square one or anything, i am not. but i feel like something inside of me has reset. my unwavering strength against addiction was broken at the slightest temptation. i still am weak. heroin is so, so much stronger than me. its truly unbelievable how much stronger it is than me. 

when i was young, my aunt had cancer. she beat it. then it came back soon after, and she beat it again. it didn't come back, and we loved how strong she was for fighting her cancer and that she had overcome it. she lived with us. i remember her feeling of strength after her 2nd year of not having cancer, her 3rd year, her 6th year.... it finally felt like it was gone for good. her thinking ""its finally behind me now, its a part of my past"", and then it just fucking came back. 9 years after her first diagnosis, it came back and killed her. i remember her feelings and how she felt about it. so many years after she thought it had gone away. 

that is how i feel. like a cancer which i thought i got rid of a decade ago just showed back up on my screening. 

the first 5-6 days after i tried it that time outside the bar were the worst. my kids and wife have come back. the urges mostly went away the second i saw my kids. i hugged them so damn hard. 

and i never told my family what happened, nor will i ever. my wife never understood that side of me, she met me 5 whole years after i was clean. i just cannot have her know, ever. 

i won't do it again. i am planning on not drinking to excess like that again, except maybe in very specific situations like at the summer house where there is no option of drugs. i mean, not like i want to get drunk again like that, but just in case i ever want to get loose? i am never doing that in the city again. 

i am still about 90%+ sure that i won't ever touch heroin again. i am still positive in myself about it. its just... it used to be 99% sure. that is what fucking terrifies me. 

i said heroin is stronger than me. it is absolutely stronger than me. but the reason i won't ever do it again is that it isn't stronger than my family, my wife and kids. i don't care about how good it feels, i will not subject my wife and children to me being an addict. i would rather just kill myself than that.

"8 years ago i caused a ufo panic. one college summer break 8 years ago my friends and i were bored. we remembered a demonstration from a high school science class of a ""solar balloon"". this was just a really thin black plastic bag you'd fill with air, seal, and then set out in the sun. the sun would heat the air in the black bag and the bag would become buoyant and float.  
  
we had the idea to find the cheapest/thinnest black plastic trash bags available and combine a bunch of them to make a huge balloon. we spent a few days driving around to walmarts and dollar stores trying different brands to find the thinnest possible plastic bag and thinnest tape which would work the best. finally we took a number of them, cut off the bottom ends, and taped them together into a huge balloon which we filled up with a leaf blower and then tied the end. after sitting out in the sun for a half hour or so we had done it!  
  
this is a picture a friend had taken as it was just becoming buoyant.(https://imgur.com/1kmebpm)
  
we had to mess around with how the tape was sealing the bags to use as little of it as possible as the weight of the tape added up and made the balloon harder to float.
   
shortly after this the balloon got away from us(https://imgur.com/ejipkfq)  
further(https://imgur.com/a/ruoxwch)  
  
this was dissapointing, but we made another one and got funny looks from cars driving by and were entertained for a bit. shortly after that this new balloon met it's demise smacking into a tree and getting popped. oh well, mission success.  
  
a few years later i happened across this news article(https://www.nj.com/news/local/index.ssf/2010/05/look_up_in_the_sky_its_a_large.html). the balloon that got away had apparently blown a town over and caused a big ufo panic. people were calling 911, the police, and local radio stations about it. our boredom unintentionally created a ufo panic in central nj. i moved out of the area but when i get together with my friend we always bring this up and have a good laugh.  
  

edit: wow didn't really think this would gain much traction. also didn't expect any nj redditors to have seen this let alone the author of the article to show up. glad everyone thinks this is funny but that being said please don't go out and do this on purpose.

"i faked my resume and now i'm in the shit........... throwaway account for obvious reasons. since i started high school, my parents stopped checking in on my grades and their mentality was basically ""we don't care as long as you get into a good university"" and they've carried on this mentality to when i got into college and they didn't really checked on my grades and gave me free rein as long as i majored in the subjected they wanted and graduated on time with good grades. well basically what happened was that i failed my first year and had to switch my major. i didn't tell them and they didn't ask so i thought as long as i got my shit together and not drop out i'll be fine. one day out of the blue last semester my dad asked me to write up a resume. i panicked and wrote up a resume but changed the gpa and major and made up some shit and thought i saved myself. welp, this winter break my dad dropped it on me and told me he knows people in a big company, he gave them my resume and everything and wanted me to intern there. so i am fucked. they'll probably figure it out and let my dad know and i'll probably get disowned or something, and best case scenario they don't check and give me the job, and i have to live with the guilt that i got a job that i didn't deserve cause of nepotism, this shit is depressing as fuck and i'm typically an easy going guy but this whole ordeal is giving me anxiety like nothing else. i feel like an ass for failing and lying to my family about it and now i'm on the verge of being blown and i thought maybe making a post here will make me feel better but i honestly don't know.

"i snooped on the ceo's email account and got myself unfired. a couple years out of college i worked as an analyst at a pretty small private equity firm. the ceo was one of the biggest assholes i've ever met. he was fairly young in his 40s, a multi millionare, and the type of guy driven solely by money with 0 business ethics. he'd do anything to get the upper hand in a deal regardless of who it screws over...contractors, employees...i even saw him seriously fuck over a long time family friend of his without any remorse.

anyway, aside from my analyst role, as it was a really small business (only about 20 people in the office, and then a bunch of people working remote), i also happened to be one of the only semi technology-literate people in the company. so like many of my generation, i became the defacto ""millenial office computer guy"" too. despite my lack of qualifications i got put in charge of handling pretty much anything minor tech related. setting up servers....fixing laptop issues...answering ""how do i convert this to pdf"" questions...even basic network security. they thought i was some sort of computer genius...but really i was just mostly winging it, googling pretty much everything.

but eventually i got legitimately pretty good at all the tech stuff. they gave me bigger tasks like planning all of the computer systems for their owned businesses, and supervising installs. i didn't get paid extra for any of this mind you.

after a couple years of serious bullshit working there, i was pretty worn out. i wasn't progressing. i hated working for captain douchebag...he treated everyone like shit. i was pulling 12-14+ hour days with no overtime or performance bonus. and they weren't paying me nearly what they should have. i also hated being ""the tech guy"" and was depressed as fuck basically living in a cubicle. so i decided i full on had enough of the 9-8 life working for assholes....and i would start my own consulting business working for myself.

however, instead of quitting right away, i figured it would be smart to first build up my client base on the side while i was still getting a steady paycheck. so thats what i did. i launched my company, and landed my first clients.

as the workload increased, i slowly started spending more and more time working on my side business while at my office job. at first i was pretty low key about it. but eventually, it was blatant. as it was a super small company....i was the only one who knew how to do a lot of important tasks and operate some key internal systems. it was easy for me to tell my boss a project was taking a whole week to complete, that i actually finished in 10 minutes.

pretty soon i was spending 80% of my day working on my own stuff in the office. i'd even take calls for my side business clients at my desk. the rest of the time i was usually dicking around on reddit or something. of course, we had systems in place to monitor network activity. but i was the person in charge of monitoring it.

this continued for a while. as my own business ramped up, i cared less and less about the office job. and since i hated waking up early, i began rolling into work late. at first it was only 30 minutes or so. then it progressed to an hour. when my boss didn't reprimand me...it became clear how much they needed me there. i took full advantage of this. before long i was arriving around noon, working for a couple hours, then heading home. 

my coworkers werent happy, but i helped them with all of their tech problems and they hated the company too, so they kept their mouths shut about it. my boss eventually said something to me about all it at one point, but i just came in on time the next few days and then went back to coming in whenever i wanted.

after more than 2 months of coming in 4-5 hours late, and working on my side business in full view of my asshole boss, i couldn't believe i wasn't fired yet. i deserved it and felt it was inevitable.

on a hunch, i decided to do a little investigative work. as i was the ""tech guy"", i also had full access to the company email server. so i logged into the ceo's personal email account, and searched for my name. lo and behold, there was a recent email thread between him, my direct boss, and some other team members with my name in the subject line. obviously i open it. they're discussing my recent performance issues...the last email in the chain basically said ""if nobody has any objections, i will be terminating him at the end of the week"". 2 days from then.

i wasn't surprised, but i decided there was no way i was going to let these assholes fire me. although i didn't give a shit about that job, i didn't want to have a termination in my work history. i also wanted to keep getting paid for a while longer. of course, i couldn't let him know i actually knew i was getting canned. so, i formulated a plan to perform a little inception reverse-psychology mind fuck on the ceo.

the next day, one day before they planned to fire me, i requested a meeting with him to ""discuss my current performance."". in that meeting i sat down, and he asked me what i wanted to talk about. so i told him (paraphrased): ""look, i know i've been a shitty employee lately. i'm sure you've noticed. correct me if i'm wrong, but i've been kind of getting the feeling you guys are planning to let me go soon."" when i said that the shocked look on his face was priceless...he must have thought i was psychic to work that out on my own the day before it was going to happen. i remember him just saying something like ""uhh"". i continued while he sat flabbergasted. ""so i'll be honest with you, my heart isn't in this job anymore. as you know, i'm an entrepreneur at heart...which i'm sure you can relate to. i want to start my own company. however, as you're aware, i have a lot of responsibilities here nobody else can do."" i then proceeded to list all of the things i did and projects i was working on. i could see it on his face when the realization sunk in of how screwed he'd be if i left suddenly.

""so here's what i propose. you don't fire me. i don't quit. i keep working here for a month, finish my current projects, and train whoever you want on everything i'm in charge of. after a month is up, i will continue to come in once per week until its complete. after that, if you still need me...you can pay me on an hourly project-by-project basis"".   

i intentionally mentioned the possibility of me quitting so he could feel like he ""won"" the negotiation, even though i technically had him by the balls. 

he paused to think for a minute, then said something along the lines of: ""okay. you have a deal"".  

so, not only did i get myself unfired...i actually turned the company into a paying client. during that month, i continued doing pretty much whatever i wanted since i had an expiration date (while training my replacement as promised). after the month was up they hit me up regularly for remote task work . i charged them triple what i was earning while working there, and barely had to deal with the ceo.  my client base was big enough i dropped them for good.

...after all that, the ceo still calls me up for advice/questions nearly 3 years later. these days i just blow him off saying ""sorry, i'm too busy"".

**edit:** as it seems there's some doubt that this actually happened (it did), figured i'd clarify a few points.

1) this was a very small company. the office had about 20 people in it, and several dozen more worked remote. if you've never worked in a small office before, i can assure you it's pretty normal for employees to wear many hats and take on random roles outside their initial scope. it's also pretty normal for them to be severely lacking with network security and controlling passwords. 

2) i did not become some ""computer genius"" and never claimed to be (tho my company of technology illiterate baby boomers sometimes thought of me that way). i had decent basic working knowledge coming into the job, and picked up more over the several years i was there. for anything complicated (like wiring, hardware installs, advanced networking tasks etc) we hired outside it consultants. but i was the guy who would source them, hire them, supervise them and learn the systems they put in place. and i just handled more basic tasks myself . we're also not talking about enterprise level security here either

3) my consulting business has nothing to do with private equity. im not going to reveal exactly what i do for privacy sake since this blew up, but it's in marketing. i didn't steal any of my old company's clients when i left and don't compete with them**

4) yes, im fully aware and admit i was an asshole, hence posting this in /r/confession. in fact i decided to start my own company because i hate working for other people without my own skin in the game. i'm not a great employee when i don't care about what i'm doing. however, the guys running the company were pretty shitty people, and i did not feel that bad about it at the time. 
  
      the thing i did have reservations about was snooping on the emails. i do not condoned invading privacy like that. however, he'd freely given me the passwords (so i could help him set up his outlook, forwarding, etc), and i felt me getting fired was inevitably coming soon. ",11

"for three years, i switched my partner's tea in the morning because i couldn't deal with his fake snobbery.. when my ex and i started dating, i used to make him a morning cup of tea as a cute gesture and it stuck for the three years that we were together. it's a nice small thing you can do to make someone's day and and it's a nice way to get to know how someone likes things doing. so, my morning tea used to be any old teabag (yorkshire tea if it was on offer), a splash of milk, and the first cup always had a teaspoon of sugar; every cup after was just tea and milk. my ex however had to have a very specific ritual: thompsons punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. he was adamant that he could tell in a heartbeat when his morning cup of tea and at the age of 33, he's never liked any other tea other than fortnum & mason's royal blend.

so, in the beginning when he would stay at mine, i entertained this notion and used to make his morning tea the way he liked: thompsons punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. he would always thank me and tell me that i make the best cups of tea and it was nice, three times a week didn't kill me and it was a sweet gesture. fast forward three months when he would spend nearly everyday of the week at mine (but not moved in), he was very demanding of his morning ritual and being a student, i couldn't keep affording to buy that brand of tea; besides, what was wrong with pg tips or any non-branded supermarket tea? tea is tea after all. so, i used to always make his cup of tea with any tea bag, a teaspoon of milk and no sugar. i was always sure to only make it when he was in the shower or still in bed so he could never catch me out and initially, he was dubious and was always asking to make sure it was thompsons punjana tea (he used to call it by it's full name to emphasise how good it was). after a few trials of different teas, i finally found that sweet point where he couldn't taste the difference. i would drink it with him and as he sipped, would go on about how you can taste the quality and that there is really no other tea like it.

when we moved in with each other, it was a lot harder to disguise the fact that i was keeping the same box of tea and just filling it with regular tea bags so i had to be a bit more clever. at the time, i was studying at college so i was in control of weekly food shops and only really wanted to go twice a week to minimise costs so we had more to spend on meals out. i used to buy one bag of his tea and two bags of mine a week and kept them in the drinks cupboard. when it came to making his in the morning, i would take one of his teabags and put it in my pocket, giving him one of mine instead and i used to give my tutors at college his tea to drink during the day. he would always comment that i run out quicker of my tea bags because of the quality and that with punjana, one bag is enough for a considerable amount of time; little did he know. this went on for a couple of years and i never told anyone about it out of fear that he would find out, as after all, he really couldn't tell so why ruin the fun? it was saving me money and it was sort of amusing. i never let him make a cup of tea unless i was away so he never really had to find out. 

after we split up, we remained good friends and i've spent some time with him too in our old flat. every time i visit, he always asks me to make a cup of tea the way i used to for old times sake because everyone he's been with or dated after me can never ""make it taste the way i did"". he even says that when he makes it himself with punjana that he could never make it taste right and that i was some sort of special tea maker. i still haven't told him.

this is a long post about tea so the tldr: ex used to play on that he was very fussy with tea, i switched his morning cup to a considerably cheaper tea bag and he could never tell the difference and still can't.",11

edit 2: wow was not expecting this to blow up. for those of you saying i need help, trust me i get that. i was in a very dark place at the time. and i was very drunk while doing all of this. i ended up going to rehab and am happily sober now. my life has immensely changed for the better and i handle things way better now!

edit 3: for those of you wondering why i ""let the ex off easy""- honestly i should have guessed he wasn't that into me. i just wanted him bad and deep down knew he was using me for a place to stay/food/my car/etc. i got myself into that situation. it was a really rough time and i had literally 0 self respect. what really broke my heart was my best friend betraying me like that. i did kick the ex out and he was homeless/without a car/etc so he didn't get off easy that's for sure. but at the same time the pain from him cheating was absolutely nothing compared to the realization that i lost my best friend.

"when i nannied i would read the journal of the mom.. i was only 20 years old and i nannied for this little baby boy. the mom seemed off. she would sleep the entire time i was there in the mornings , or go on three hour runs, or sometimes would just go about her business around the house- completely ignoring me. one time we both sat in the living room while the baby was sleeping in his room- i was reading a book (studying) and she sat there eating mcdonald's and watching her show. she did not say a word to me the entire time. 

well, one day when she was out i snooped around and found her journal- i read the whole thing. then got sad for her- she was so unhappy in her marriage and in life.

i ended up working for her for three years and we became close. but that first year was so uncomfortable and awkward. in retrospect, it seems very obvious that she was suffering from post pregnancy depression.

edit: thanks everyone for the positive comments; i honestly was not expecting that- i just wanted to confess. for those of you who think i'm a horrible person for doing this, that's ok. it was over 15 years ago and it still weighs on my mind that i invaded someone's privacy. i felt bad about it then which is why i tried to repay by helping, but yes i did invade someone's privacy and that's not cool, i'm certainly not saying what i did was ok. hence, the confession...

also, as a 20 year old with no concept of the hardships of having kids i didn't understand why she was acting the way she was; i get it now.",11
"i found my brothers suicide note on reddit and didn't tell anyone.. throwaway account.

remorse

when i was around 14 or 15 i found my older brothers reddit account because of a secret santa package that got sent to us. i of course wanted to snoop onto his account so i checked his history, and found all of his posts for the past month had been been to /r/depression 

one post mentioned how my family, including me, were out of town due to me playing sports. that was the night he said he would finally commit suicide. he mentioned either pills or knives and it still haunts me to this day. i was obscenely scared when i found this post, and was home alone and vowed to myself to never let anyone know that i found this. to this day, my parents do not know, and have tried to keep me in the dark about his struggles with mental health as much as they can, and my brother most definitely does not know. the only person who knows is my now long term girlfriend, and now you guys. i feel awful for never telling anyone in my family, and i feel like this has taken a toll on my own mental health, which in itself is not in a good state at all.

i just want to thank whoever dissuaded my brother from commiting suicide that day. he doesn't know how much of a positive impact he's had on my life, and you kept him around so he could further that impact.",11
"i call fake orders in to a pizza place to get free pizzas.. my husband works at a popular pizza chain. we'll call it ""piece of butt"" for the sake of rhyming.
 if orders are messed up or carry out orders don't show, the employees get to take the food home. sometimes i order pizzas under fake names and give the numbers of local businesses as callback numbers, and then purposefully never show up to pay for it. 9 times out of 10 my husband brings home the pizza i ordered. this is sinful pizza, yes i know. but sin pizza tastes better than honest pizza, inexplicably.

edit:
wow, guys! i'm glad so many people found this entertaining. i'm glad to put a smile on anonymous internet faces. thanks for the gold and silver. my first gold! 
for those who say i am a ""pizza shit,"" why yes, yes i am. especially since i can afford to buy the pizza.. i hope i don't put peice of butt out of business, i'd feel so bad since they've treated my husband *so well* as an employee..
for those who went through my post history and want to report this to the school i work at: please. do it. my boss could use a laugh. 
for those who immediately messaged me about my divorce/ being single now: you must at least work at papa john's or better, and maybe i'll consider you. papa bless y'all.

"my brother beat me up so i ruined his relationship. no regrets

my brother and i have a very bad relationship, there's a lot of yelling and cussing but we never got phisycal until one night he came home very angry and just started punching and kicking me. our parents weren't home so i guess that's why he felt brave. i ended up with a busted lip, a black eye and a bunch of bruises all over my body. after that our father sent him away for a while. a few days later i used my mom's phone to ""accidentally"" call his girlfriend and left it on while i talked to my mom how worried i was that he was capable to beat up his little sister, imagine what he could do to his girlfriend.

the next day the girl showed up at our house saying that she wanted to hang out with the family, which was really weird because she would only do that when my brother was at home.  but when she saw me she started freaking out asking what had happened and if it had anything to do with my brother. my mom ended up telling her and she dumped him the same day.

"buried money in the sand so dad could find it with his metal detector. dad bought himself a metal detector because we've been going to the beach quite alot, and he wanted to see what he could find. 
well one day he set his detector up, walked to the beach and went on his way to bag himself some gnarly trinkets. he'd been doing it for about 20 minutes at this point and nothing came of it but we were nearing the end of that section of beach. he looked more and more disappointed with every step he took, so i walked ahead and discreetly placed £7 worth of coinage in the sand, on his path, but a metre away from eachother (so about £2 in each hole kinda thing) . he found it and had the cutest, most smug smile ever and was screeching with excitement with every find. we eventually got home and he showed the family what he'd found and mum was actually quite surprised. 

although dad has a good job and £7 is a laughable amount to him, the pure joy he got from finding something, is definitely worth not telling anyone what really happened that day. ",11
"i make copies of other people's keys for personal use. whenever anyone lets me borrow a key, usually to their house in order to petsit, the first thing i do is go to walmart and make a copy of that key for personal use after they ask for it back. 

i never break into houses and steal anything, other than food or maybe alcohol, but i love the feeling of being able to effortlessly enter a place i know i don't belong without anyone's knowledge.

"i lie about having my university degree and it got me a great job. i went to an ivey league university in ontario canada right after high school. my marks weren't great but they were good enough to squeeze me in. i spent most of my time in university partying rather than studying but still managed to pass all of my first year classes. in my second year i skipped a lot of classes and was very lazy with the course work. my marks were terrible and i failed a couple of my courses. in my third year about half way through i dropped out and got a job landscaping. 

&#x200b;

i did that for a year when i realized it really sucked and i began to regret not trying harder while i was in school. i figured i would apply to jobs that would normally require the degree that i would have gotten. i had spent the few years in school i was easy enough to make the timeline on my resume make sense and although i dropped out i had a decent knowledge of the area. 

&#x200b;

the field i was attempting to enter is difficult start out in and it took a few months of sending applications to get an interview. the company i got an interview with (my now current employer) is an internationally recognized name in the energy sector. i was extremely surprised to get my interview. one of the documentation requirements was university transcripts and with an hour or two in photoshop i had my proof of graduation. i sent in the papers with the other required information and never heard anything back describing any problems with my records. i ended up going through three interviews in the process and received a position.

&#x200b;

i have have now been working with this company for almost 5 years. they provided all the necessary job training and nobody has ever questioned my education. i entered with a starting salary of $72,500 cdn and received annual raises. upon hiring me i was told that the management staff was quite impressed with me through the hiring process and that they usually only hire applicants with minimum requirement of a masters degree.

&#x200b;

i basically shit my pants everyday while in the interview/training process but now i don't really think about it ever. i didn't tell me university friends i faked having my degree. the only people that know i did this are my parents.

"i'm purposely trying not to get my wife pregnant.. i'm in my later 20's. my wife is still in her early 20's. we currently have no kids, two dogs and have been married for only 7 months. my initial plan was to be married for two years and get established in our jobs, which are fairly new, then start trying for kids. i really do want them and i've expressed my concern to her, but she doesn't want to hear any of it. this person got pregnant, this person is due anytime, her friends from high school/college are having kids, etc. she wants a baby.

we dated for a total of three years before we got married. the first two were a sex filled romp. my wife is a freak in bed and she sure showed it. after we got engaged, it slowed down a bit and she wasn't as freaky, but it was still satisfying. now that we're married, she doesn't want anything intimate unless we are trying. if i say, ""hey, wanna have sex"", or even attempt foreplay, she brushes me off...but...if i say, ""hey, let's make a baby!"" she turns back into freak mode.

my wife is one of those that thought if a guy ejaculates inside a woman, she will become pregnant no matter what. she didn't realize about ovulation and peak times and whatnot. so, after she learned about it, she asked me to download the *flo* app and chart her cycles for her. i did, but manipulated the whole thing. when she thinks she's ovulating, she's not and the chances of her getting pregnant are slim to none. 

sometimes i'll tell her that her ""peak"" day(highest chance of getting pregnant) is coming up in a few days so we should start early. we have crazy sex for 3-4 days in a row and then nothing while she's actually ovulating. 

i'm a bad person. i will eventually give her a baby. just not anytime soon.",11

"i made my brother think he has alopecia for the last fifteen years.. this is probably the pettiest thing i have ever done, and i regret it to this day. when i was fifteen years old, i got my first job and started to have some money of my own. i used my money to spoil myself and purchased nicer thing like clothes, shoes, makeup and salon brand shampoo.

my brother used to sneak into my bathroom and constantly steal my nice shampoo. he would use them and most of the time he would leave them open in the bathtub. this would result in the rest of the shampoo going down the drain and leave me with empty containers.

this drove me completely insane and i hated him for taking my things. i tried to speak with my parents about this, but they told me that i should just learn to share.

one day i went out and purchased hair removal cream. i mixed this into my shampoo bottle and left it in my bathroom. i gave him a verbal warning not to use my newly purchased bottle, but he stole it again anyway. over the next few days his hair slowly started to fall out and small bald patches started to appear.

seeing what i had done i immediately emptied the remaining shampoo. i felt terrible and i truly didn't think it would have as a dramatic effect as it did. my mother took him to the doctor to get check out and they diagnosed him with alopecia. he than had to start using this special and terrible smelling shampoo to combat this.  

his hair did grow back but i just recently found out that he is still using the shampoo in order to prevent another alopecia flair up. it has been 15 years now and i have never told my brother that i caused him to lose his hair.

edit:

some people are asking why i let this go on for 15 years. i honestly had no idea that he was still using the shampoo and just assumed he stopped at some point or that the doctor had told him he didn't have alopecia. 

i just helped him move over the weekend and found a fresh bottle of the shampoo in his bathroom. i completely forgot about this until now.

edit 2:

he lived in the basement in the mother in law suite. so it did take a lot of effort for him to come in my second floor private bathroom to steal my shampoo and conditioner. not trying to defend my poor decision but he didn't just happen to use it by mistake. i didn't just leave my things lying around.",11
i shit on my neighbors door step. so back when i was ten my dad asked me if i wanted to make 20$. i accepted.  the catch i had to shit on our neighbors door step. it was clear my dad had beef with this woman.  she woke in the morning and tried to blame our chihuahua.  my dad yelled at her saying that the  shit was bigger then our dog.  impossible. the point is i don't feel bad. forever daddy's girl.,11
"when i was a server i threw a customers phone into a trash compactor. i had just started serving tables at a restaurant,  and i was working my first super busy brunch shift. i had 6+ tables and i'm not gonna lie, i had a tough time running all the mimosas that my tables were ordering. i could tell that one table of all women were getting abnormally angry about their drinks taking a while. i apologized for the delay and made a joke about it being an especially busy shift. i offered them a round of drinks on me to smooth the situation over. when i walked away, one lady murmured under her breath that i was an ""incompetent cunt"". 

let's stop there, its common for people to treat servers like shit, but this was the first time i ever had experienced being spoken to like i was garbage. i shook it off and continued to be nice to them, but it only got worse from there. they started to laugh at me, and shit talk me to one another. they told me that my future career looked pretty bleak, considering i couldn't even serve tables, ""honey, even a toddler can deliver drinks"". when i took their order for food, one woman refused to speak to me. she just stared at me while her friend ordered for her. by now i am pissed. i asked her why she felt the need to have her friend order for her? she laughed in my face, looked down at the menu, and said because i was a dumb little bitch. 

due to the fact i was at work, i couldn't argue or tell her to eat shit for treating me like i was a dog, if i did my boss would have fired me. they ended up stiffing me on their 200 dollar check. once they left, i realized the woman that gave me so much shit had left her phone. i took it and went out the back door to smoke a cigarette and try to calm down, who the hell did that women think she is? so i promptly turned off her phone, threw it in the trash compactor, and turned it on. she came back minutes later and asked multiple staff members if we found it, i told her that i didn't see it when i bussed the table, and that i would call her if it turned up. i never told anyone but i never regretted doing it. when you treat people like shit, expect shitty things to happen to you


edit #1. thanks for my first ever metal kind stranger! 

edit #2. i should have clarified that they stiffed me, as in they didn't tip me. they did pay their bill before they bounced

when i came to school the next day though the same kid i bought the pringles from, gave me back the $40 while crying because apparently his mom screamed at him to give it back and now he couldn't buy candy with it because his mom wouldn't let him keep it. i held on to that money for a couple days until my mom started looking around and asking if i had seen the money laying around since it wasn't in her purse, so once i realized how i'd get my ass beat if she found out i hid it under the couch and 'found' it about 30 minutes later. i never got caught but still look back on it and laugh that i essentially got some pringles for free from the whole ordeal.",11

this is petty. i don't care.

i've worked at a company for two years. in that time, i've gone from an 'incredible asset to the company' to 'babysitter'.

i wish i was joking.

this company is owned by several people, but managed by a relative to the higher ups. a guy who has never worked for anyone except his mommy (who owns the company). a guy who is incapable of doing basically anything for himself. someone who will 'one day' take over the company, who currently can't even figure out bluetooth.

moron would be a compliment. you think i'm just being harsh on my boss, or exaggerating.

i wish. i wish it was just me being dramatic.

last phonecall i had from him was him asking where he was. no, i'm serious.

""foot, i'm driving. where am i?""

he asks me to track his phone, find his location, see if i can find a store near him that sells a certain item (that he can't remember the name of the store either, or where it is exactly), and then i am to gps voice navigate him there using track his phone to tell him when to turn.

this is my life. 50+ phone calls a day from this man.

""foot, did you get my email?""

""yes, i responded to it and answered your questions.""

""oh good. read it out to me.""

proceed to read the email to him. he is happy.

fast forward two hours. get a scathing email from him, responding to my reply:

""foot, why did you email me again when we just talked about this on the phone?! this wastes my time.""

i no longer do my regular job. i've been transitioned into this 'personal assistant' role, even though i did not want it. at all. to the point i'm currently searching for a new job.

the company is bleeding money like someone cut off both of its legs. boss is supposed to be figuring out why, but the guy can't even pour himself a cup of coffee from the machine we've had for six *years.*

in my day to day, i also assist other departments. i have access to various software. i work alongside multiple managers and assist with their projects as well (when i'm not being asked to identify the brand of socks boss is wearing so that he can figure out where to buy more, and have me call to 'have them set aside a package for me so i don't have to walk through the store looking for these like an idiot')

based on my observations, i found several problems that are costing us money. either by purchasing, distribution or just general lack of adaquate price adjustments. some were serious enough that i even spoke to a different department manager, who was impressed and took me to the ceo to ask if i can be moved to their department to help fix some of the identified problems.

ceo is boss's mother.

i get told that i absolutely am not allowed to transfer. that i am far too valuable as a personal assistant to be shared with other departments. that boss will handle and oversee the changes that need to be made.

manager and i were stunned. turns out, mother wants to step away from the company and wants boss to run it. that boss just needs more projects to work on to get a better understanding of how to run the company.

boss gets called in, told that i identified several issues and that boss needs to get them resolved. boss gets mad at mother, telling her he doesn't have time to do that. mother says she understands, that he is a very busy boy. (again, i'm not joking. sitcoms can't even write this kind of shit).

boss later calls me into his office, and tells me that i am to work on fixing all of these issues, but that i'm to give him all my notes, tell him how i fixed it and he will present it to the board. boss then proceeds to leave for the day, calling me later to ask what kind of mustard was the mustard he liked the most on his deli sandwiches. then proceeded to lecture me on mustard, because the answer i gave him was obviously not the right kind of mustard and that i need to pay more attention to things like that.

i hung up the phone, picked up all my notes on this 'bleeding money' situation / project and shredded them.

oops. sorry! i'm too much of an idiot to handle doing any type of investigation work into our financial records for the past 5 years. i'm certainly too much of an idiot to notice that your profit margins went from 32% to less than 18.3% on the majority of our products we manufacture, all the while giving our distributors more than 46% discount so that they 'keep coming back for more'.

here is hoping boss can figure that out, especially considering the layoffs we keep having.

excuse me while i make note of what kind of mustard he prefers on his montreal smoked meat sandwich, which is a much more important use of my time.

because, in the words of boss: ""maybe one day you'll be capable, like me, if you keep working at it.""

i hope i get fired.

"i lied to my best friend to get off the phone not knowing he was writing his suicide note and just wanted one last chat.. one day after school i was with a few friends and we were all smoking, at some point during the session i got a call from my best friend who sounded a bit out of it and didn't really seem like he had any other intention than to just have a conversation. we spoke for about 2 minutes and then it was my turn in the circle so i told my friend that my phone was about to die so i was going to have to get back to him. 

the next day i awoke to multiple missed calls from his mother, i called her immediately and she told me that he had hanged himself and that he was in a coma. i would then go on to spend 4 days in a hospital by his side for the most part, on the fourth day they turned his life support off. 

during all of this i checked his phone as i was the only person who knew his passcode and i found a suicide note, the timestamp was around the time that he had called me the day before. i'm not sure if i will ever get over the fact that i gave up my last conversation ever with the greatest person i've ever known for a bong.

"our first daughter was raped at 14 and we raised the baby as our own child. our first daughter committed suicide and we carried on raising the baby. my grandchild thinks we're her parents and i cant bring myself to tell her the truth even now. this is a lengthy confession. i'm sorry if you don't like reading long posts you can skip to the end if you want.

our first daughter was raped when she was 14. it destroyed her childhood and flipped our lives upside down. you always assume if you bring your child up right and take care of them nothing bad will happen, but something bad just happened anyway and there was nothing we could do afterwards to make what happened right. the man who did it got sent to jail eventually, but our daughter was never the same again. counseling never brought her smile back, nothing seemed to work. she seemed so cold and emotionally dead from there onward and we tried so hard to connect back with her but nobody could. she was an island and didn't want to talk to anyone about anything. we as parents blamed ourselves for this.

we ended up pulling our daughter out of school to home school her because her attendance was very bad and she suffered night terrors which kept her awake some nights. it was probably a bad decision and over protective parenting, but we wanted to protect her and felt a regular school wasn't a safe environment for her at the time. 

as if the situation could be any worse we found out our daughter was pregnant with the rapists child. we tried to suggest an abortion because of her age and the situation, but she didn't want to. our daughter refused to abort the pregnancy, so we kept her out of school to give birth to the baby. we raised the child as our 2nd daughter to give our 1st daughter the life she was robbed. we just wanted her to enjoy her life and told her we'd raise the baby for her as her sibling and she agreed to this.

it was partly out of fear of what the neighborhood would think, and partly out of wanting our daughter to continue having a normal teenage life. it wasn't ideal, but things worked for a time and our daughter got to see her daughter whenever she wanted, which was better than giving the baby up to adoption. things didn't last this way for long though as our daughter's mental health started to deteriorate. 

when our first daughter started to become heavily suicidal. there was nothing we could do because every time we tried to get closer to her she'd push us away worse than before. she was hospitalized several times for suicide attempts until she succeeded in committing suicide. this destroyed us. at first we hated the baby and blamed it. we blamed it for the death of our daughter and were in denial it was our fault. eventually though we realized we were to blame, not the child who was brought into the world by no fault of their own. we'd focused for so long on the fact it was half of the rapist's child, that we'd overlooked the fact it was also half of our daughter.

it took a lot of time to come to this conclusion, but we'd always looked after the baby out of respect to our daughter. the thought of giving it up to adoption went through my mind several times, but i knew my daughter didn't want this and so did my wife.

we gave her daughter, our daughter the best life we could. we bought her anything she could ever want, took her to concerts and on holidays. we even sent her to a private school despite the extra expense with hopes that she will become successful in life and live the life our daughter never got to live.

she is home right now and whenever she hugs me or my wife and says: ""i love you mom/dad"" it hurts like a dagger through our hearts. i always look towards my wife every time our daughter says it. she finds it as painful as i do and i can tell by the look in her eyes. it's not that we don't love her, it's that her entire life is being lived believing a lie. we're actually her grandparents and she has no idea of this. she's never asked if we're really her true parents because obviously she has never had a reason too. part of me though believes lying by omission is still lying though. we've never told her the truth about her sister being her mother.

she knows her sister committed suicide, but she is too young to remember her. i feel as though we're protecting her from being damaged and hurt by keeping her oblivious to all of this. maybe i'm just being selfish, maybe my wife is too. we just don't want to see her suffer.

the thought of her not being strong enough to hear the truth scares me the most. i know i shouldn't compare her to my other daughter, but i would never forgive myself if she committed suicide too after learning the truth. i cannot lose both of them, i can't survive another loss like this.

the whole situation is soul crushing. the only person i can talk to is my wife. it feels like some massive thing nobody else can ever know. not even our parents know the truth.",11
"i anonymously put my friends phone number on a gay craigslist add. this was a few years ago before cl stopped the relationship stuff. as a joke, i created an add of craigslist relationships - male looking for male. 

essentially the add was pretty much a guy looking for a 1 way ticket to pound town, ready to fuck and suck anything,  willing to be a cum dump, and all types of things. i made sure to make it for serious inquiries only. i put his phone in the weird code like everyone else on similar adds like 5(5)5-five-three37-55(four)5.

i sat back an waited. the next day, he makes a fb post about ""who the fuck put my number on a gay craigslist add,"" and if he gets 1 more dick pic he ""will strangle whoever did this."" as you could imagine, the comment replies on his post were great.

"i once skunked a bottle of wine given to a bullying manager on my team then gave it to her. many moons ago i was working for a large technology company. it was common practice for managers on the same team to exchange some sort of token holiday gift just before christmas - something under $20. 


one of these managers was a very nasty woman who was quietly bullying some of her employees and one of the other managers on our team. we were trying to deal with her through the proper channels but, the holidays sprang up in the meantime. 


when the holidays came around, i bought a case of a nice red wine that i enjoyed and prepped them all with giftbags. except one bottle - the bottle for the nasty manager. 


i took that bottle and spent about two weeks heating the bottle and chilling the bottle by wrapping it in a particularly warm heating pad and standing it on top of my old apartments hot water heater for one or two hours then sticking it in the freezer until the bottle was cold to the touch. my goal was to ruin the wine, turn it to vinegar. 


the holidays came and i gave my fellow managers their gift wine and we all headed out of the office for a few days for company-wide ooo. 


when we came back everyone was talking about how wonderful the wine was. except the nasty manager, who was surprised everyone loved it. she was going on about how nasty it was and how bad it smelled and how she couldn't even drink it. 


it was intended as a harmless prank but, when she was fired a few days later for bullying people, she exploded and mentioned my ""shitty wine"" in her tirade as she threw things around the office on her way out the door. i felt some degree of pride about that because fuck her for bullying people.

"i made my school believe they broke my ipad and made them buy me a new one.. my highschool didn't allow phones/tablets to be on your person throughout the school day, instead they made us all hand our devices in every morning and pick them up at the end of the school day. they provided us with these white cushioned envelope bags to protect them by it really did nothing. 

anyway one morning i was rushing to catch the bus and on the way out of my bedroom i decide to throw my ipad onto my bed. but it bounced off, landing face down on the slate tiles. i knew straight away it smashed from the sound, i stood there cursing myself until i had an idea. i grabbed my phone bag and put the broken ipad and shattered glass in it and took it to school. 

i handed it in acting nonchalant about it and when it came time to pick it up in the afternoon i put my best shocked/sad face on as i opened the bag. i went to the nearest teacher and told her that i found my ipad broken. she took me to the office and eventually to the principal. at first she seen suspicious about the entire thing but when my dad (25 year army veteran) came in to pick me up, he gave her and the entire admin staff a spraying.

she originally agreed to pay for it to be repaired but when that couldn't be done she agreed to buy a replacement model. but the thing is that the ipad was a 2nd gen model and it was 2014 so ended up getting a brand new model as well. 

i never admitted it to anyone in school out of fear it would eventually lead to the principal finding out. 

edit: the teacher didn't pay for it, the principal used the schools credit card

"i used to work in a shoe shop and deliberately sold a customers shoes whilst she was trying on shoes, just to make her buy a new pair.. title says it all. i was 16 and my first job was in a shoe shop. we had one regular awkward woman customer who came in every saturday afternoon whilst the store was at its busiest and literally asked to try on every pair of shoes in the shop before leaving an hour later without buying anything. i was the new boy and the youngest, so all the other staff always dumped her on me. one day, she was up to her usual saturday afternoon hobby and an elderly lady, obviously visually impaired handed me a pair of shoes and asked me how much...  they were the awkward customers own shoes that the elderly woman had picked from the floor. i quoted her a ridiculously low price and she bought them immediately. ten minutes later, the awkward customer started shrieking that she couldn't find her shoes and after complaining to the manager believing they had been stolen by shoplifters. he was having none of it stating it wasn't the companies fault if customers had their personal property stolen in the store. the woman had to buy a new pair of shoes or leave bare footed. we never saw her again.


edit: thankyou for all the replies. i would never have believed this posting would generate so much interest as i posted this story over a year ago as a reply on askreddit and only received 3 replies, lol.

to elaborate on the story and answer some of the questions raised; firstly, yes, it is a true story and happened some time over the school summer holiday period of 1984 shortly after i started working at the store. the department i worked in wasn't exactly the normal shoe shop environment most people are familiar with. i worked in a special department on the lower ground floor of one of the larger branches of a national shoe retailer and this department sold all the reject stock from all the other branches. stuff such as shop soiled, sun faded stock from window displays, repaired damaged stock, customer returns etc. the stuff that was below the standard that could be sold in the regular departments. all stock we held was displayed on the shop floor on racks so you couldn't ask for different sizes etc as it was all random stuff. we only displayed the right foot of a pair of shoes and customers had to ask for the left foot of the shoe to try on, and there was a rule that only one pair could be given to one customer to try on for security reasons. we had a major problem with shoplifting and there were only normally two or maximum three members if staff manning the department. it was a hell of a job keeping track of the pairs that were handed to customers to try when the shop floor was busy, and often shoplifters waited till we were all distracted then left without paying. this was before cctv so all we had were our eyes to monitor where paired stock was on the shop floor... the woman i describe as awkward, wasn't just awkward in the traditional sense, she was totally obnoxious, narcissistic, racist and constantly demanding attention. her behaviour lost us a lot of stock to shoplifters because she distracted us from watching other paired stock out on the shop floor and she wouldn't return pairs she didn't want, just kicked them off in a corner before wandering around looking for the next pair. a couple of weeks before the story, a pair of shoes she had asked to try were stolen because of her doing this and her attitude when we asked her, was that it wasn't her problem and we deserved to lose stock because we were all jews (sorry if this is offensive to you but that's what she said)... back to the original story, lol, the incident wasn't premeditated, it was one of those spontaneous  'fuck you' opportunities where all rationality temporarily disappears for a moment. the elderly lady handed me the bitch woman's shoes and that was it, lol. i only asked the elderly lady for either 50p or £1, i can't remember what, bagged them and the sale went through the till followed by a thankyou... incidentally, the condition of the bitch woman's shoes and quality of brand was a lot better than the crap we sold, so the old  dear got one hell of a bargain... my thoughts immediately afterwards weren't of satisfaction, they were of 'oh shit', and i was bricking it, worrying what would happen next, lol. when the shit hit the fan and the manager became involved, i was just glad he was pre-aware of her and had no sympathy of her loss because of her attitude when she previously lost our stock.

once again, thankyou for all replies and unexpected flow of upvotes.",11

"i sold sodas in high school after a ban of soft drinks was put into place to pay for senior fees. i ratted out my compettition.. jr year a ban in ca prohibited sale of soda in public school (specifically lausd). 

i seeing a a need by many decided to spent my small savings from  allowance (17.00) on 3 costco 24 packs. school was selling at the time for .75 cents prior to the ban. so i matched the price. roughly making 18.00 every 24 pack which was about 13.00 in profit per 24 pack.

after my first week and 3 trips to costco i made enough to buy more inventory per trip minimizing my trips to costco and cutting into profits. added variety to what i had(started with coke, then added sprite, then dr pepper). 

at first i was holding in my locker but realize heat was an issue. invested in an insulated bag and had 2-3 frozen waters inside to keep things cool, and added help was chilling the drinks the night before also, i was sold out on average before lunch or at the begining of lunch.

4 months i noticed sales drop and i was leaving school with inventory. found out i had competition of others who not only picked up on what i was doing but started selling flavor variety like cherry coke, fanta, shasta and what not. by this time i had already established myself with faculty and  added diet cokes/diet dr peppers per request, yup, paid then off with free drinks which took a hit on profits weekly but secured me from getting in trouble with most security guards where i made transactions and classes i had and a few trusted teachers from previous semester. on average lost about a 6 pack to 9 sodas weekly, no big. had the principal and a few vice principles buying as well.

needless to say competition wasnt something i needed. had em get pinched by faculty once i found out who it was. out of 6 (including myself) 4 got caught, the other gent i let him continue doing what he was doing because i knew his background and he and his fam needed the money. 

i did get pinched by a substitute in class, was sent to the same vice principle who was a buyer. all i was told was be careful and sat in his office till next class period started.

my end goal was to pay for all senior fees which include cap, gown, diploma, senior night, prom and senior ring. 

by early senior yr i had made enough to cover all fees, including my tux rental and my portion of a limo for prom night.

also bought a ps2 and saved the rest as a base starting point for. used car ( after starting a job and saving for an additional year it ended being a 97 honda accord, so nothin fancy)

end of senior yr i helped 2 jrs continue what i was doing and helped them figure it out and connected them to my faculty buyers.

i have 0 regerts about it all. 

update: holy crap this blew up while i was in class! 

what's gold?! what's silver?! 

thank you to who ever gave them to me...can i buy soda with it!?

i should also clarify this happened back late 02 to early 04. just figured stature of limitations expired and figure some people would enjoy it.

appreciate the love 

answering some questions: 

-yes i'd do it all over again, roughly 1300 in student dues was a burden my parents didnt need on them, not including the 300.00 for tux and limo fees.  i'm glad i didnt have to go sell candy to raise the money in a saturated market in which everyone was doing the same damn sales in the same district.

-yes, i was a snitch, but i felt i was in a position where i had 0 repercussions to face since i was well liked. it was a power move and it worked. 

- the ones caught got a week detention and that was it. 

i'll try and answer any questions i can 😁.",11

"i told my mom to 'just die already' while she was sick with cancer. i felt like this is the best place to confess this guilt that has been apart of me for the last 10 years. 

my sweet mother passed away when i was 9 years old. during her gruesome battle with ovarian cancer, i got frustrated seeing her rapidly deteriorate, i just said what came to my childish mind: i wish you would just die already.

nine year old me couldn't comprehend the situation, so i left her to cry and walked away with guilt. we never spoke about it, and she passed away months after that happened.

"my little brother became a transwoman. she's incredibly pretty and it's killing me inside with jealousy as her sister.. i'm drunk and this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

like the title says, my little brother (who was always the favorite one) came out to my family three years ago as trans and started her hormone therapy to become a woman. it was a bit of a shock but i love my brother(/sister) and i wished the best for her. my parents were another story and essentially disowned her and never spoke of her again.

since then, she's went through insane changes on her hormones, gotten surgery (voice change and adam's apple removal), and now she's fully passing as a woman. but she passes too well, like she's turned into fucking levels of fashion model pretty and it's pissing me off so fucking much. it's like hormone therapy gave her the face the females have in my family, but with all the right proportions and then made her look younger by a decade... whenever we hang out, guys start talking to her and flat out ignoring me (ie i don't exist apparently). i've always been considered to be the ugly duckling between the two of us (before she was a she), and now she's considered the ""hot"" sister. 2 months ago, she's turned into a literal fucking model after someone came up to her on the street and asked her to audition for a new ad campaign (for a fucking clothing chain). they had no clue she was trans because by now she's changed all her id to her new gender. i feel so guilty for thinking this, but i was secretly hoping that she would at least have some trouble with passing as a woman because i've been shit on and bullied for my looks (family, friends, everyone) since i was a kid while he's always had a girlfriend/been good looking/hyper popular/better grades.

but no i'm still the ugly one with horrible cramps that leave me paralyzed whenever its shark week and she's the one getting modeling gigs while hot guys message her non-stop. i'm trying to be there to support her because she has no one else to turn to for family but her fucking face is on billboards and bus ads now smirking back at me daily. she asks me for advice and confides me in me about things that i've never even had opportunity to have. what made me start drinking tonight was that she asked me what she should wear to an upscale party (something i've never been to) on some fucking rooftop penthouse with billionaires and actors. at first i kept my calm but then she went through the ""budget"" the clothing company gave her (20k+) for the night and her measurements (so i'm also morbidly fat apparently). i had to make up an excuse to leave, immediately went home and started taking shots of vodka. it's petty to think this way but i fucking hate my life right now.

"i killed my pet iguana. it was 12 years ago, i was 7. his name was leafy and i had him for several months. my father and i built him a special terrarium made out of an old chest. one day, i opened it up to feed him (he would only eat if i hand-fed him) and he jumped directly at me. i panicked and shut the trunk immediately, but to my dismay i shut it right on him, directly on his back. half his body was inside the trunk, half outside. it didn't cut him in half, but it definitely hurt him severely. his little iguana mouth was wide open, as if voicelessly screaming in agony. i opened the trunk and he fell back down, seemingly paralyzed.

for the next few days he would eat a little and move around, but on the third or fourth day i woke up and he was dead. my guess was that i probably tore up his insides and fatally injured his back. his last few days must've been in agony. he didn't even live that great of a life, and he was only four months old.

"my husband and i decided to indulge in a little cocaine tonight and used it to clean the shit out of our house.. my husband (33) and i (28) have been married for almost 6 years and together for about 9. no children besides our puppies, but we hope to have some in the near future. while we are not regular hard drug users, we do like to have a little fun once in a while.

"i kicked a kid in his balls and he had to have one removed.. this happened when i was around 7 or 8 years old. it was my first year in primary school and i had joined the school with some of my friends from the local feeder school in the area. 

one particular boy was a year older than us and was repeating the first year for some reason. he was of german descent, from a very well to do family and a lot bigger than the rest of us. possibly because he was embarrassed at repeating the year he was a bit of a bully. he often picked on me and some of my friends. i'm sure we probably escalated things at times too because i know he was teased for being german. 

so one day, standing outside class i kicked him full whack in the balls. he buckled over but i can't really remember much of what happened afterwards, we probably tucked tail and ran. i can't even say for sure whether he deserved to be kicked at the time or if i just thought i was getting him back for previous behaviour. 

anyway, he missed school for a few days after and i heard some kids saying he was in hospital. soon after that i was called in to speak to a teacher who as far as i remember dressed me down and explained he had gone home and his testicle has swollen up to the size of a tennis ball and it had to be removed. i don't really remember getting into much trouble about it but i do remember some of the other kids going on about it in banter. 

the details are hazy but i felt so bad and i felt i was in so much trouble that i never ever told my parents about it. this was made worse as my dad and his dad had gone to school together, only found this out after seeing my dad chatting to his dad at a rugby match that me and the kid were playing one saturday about a year after. i was freaking out the whole time they were speaking and then started feeling guilty that my dad might have been seen as rude by his dad for not apologising for my action. it didn't come across that way, as they seemed like old friends catching up but i felt so guilty. 

i felt so awful about it, i mean at the time i didn't realise that it may have an affect on him being able to have children but i felt like i'd done something so horrible and always expected my family to confront me about it. when i learnt of the reproductive challenge this might cause the guilt was just amplified. 

the years that followed in primary school were mostly fine, on the odd occasion he would have a go at me, i remember him having a slightly shorter fuse with me than others but i think he ended up being ok and less of a bully. saying that, he did try drown me in a river at our primary school leavers camp as i'd pissed him off for some reason but mostly the in-between years went by without incident. 

i left that school to go to a different high school so i never maintained contact with him. i saw him once during my teenage years and we chatted for about 5 minutes. i remember it being friendly. i never, ever mentioned it. 

i hope he was able to have children. i'm sorry bro. i'm sorry i never said sorry too.",11
"no regrets after a briefly successful suicide attempt 8 months ago, i visited the bathroom i died in and words cannot express how grateful i am to be alive right now.. on june 27th 2017 i intentionally overdosed on heroin in the handicap stall of the ladies' room in oglivie transportation center. and it worked. i was found with no pulse and not breathing. for months i resented the fact that i was brought back. i laid awake every night sobbing, abusing every drug i could get my hands on, and even attempted suicide two more times but to no avail. 

since then i met the love of my life, and she makes me want to stay sober. i want to remember every moment i spend with her. she proposed to me a bit over a month ago and i want to live as long as possible so that i can grow old with her. on our first date we went to a protest, and got cold so entered the first building we saw. it was ogilvie. we ate panda express and had our first kiss there. i didn't even realize it at the time but she gave me life in the building where i had almost successfully taken my life. yesterday we went back there and i showed her exactly where i died. i am almost 5 months clean now and am so fucking happy that i was given another chance at life.

the road leading here was rocky, but i'm grateful for every bump along the way because this was the road that lead me to her. that's not to say the road isn't still bumpy, but we have each other to ride it out with. 
we've had some devastating financial hardships recently and are homeless. but home is where the heart is. home is holding hands and laughing at our situation from a bus stop bench. home is cuddling up in an alley to stay warm in 0° weather. it's kind of funny that now i want to live, and i have to worry about surviving. this is a new feeling. it's stressful,  but i'm happy. the only tears i've been crying lately are happy ones.

edit: i'm not depending my life and sobriety on one other person, i was already on medication, sober, in therapy and on the right track when i met her. she just makes me extra grateful for life because i didn't think love would ever be an option for me and she supports me and my healthy goals.",11
"i pretended to be the merch guy at a concert so i could steal t-shirts.. pretty much just the title. 5 or 6 years ago my wife and i went to see a band we used to love. after 20 minutes or so of waiting for the merch guy to come man his booth, i had the bright (and very drunken) idea to pretend to man the booth myself. it really started as a funny gag just to make her laugh. almost immediately people came up to buy stuff. i turned them all away, which made them very confused. however, my wife did pretend to be a customer and i ""sold"" her two shirts, which really we just stole.

in my defense, i never took anyones money (i told them i was waiting to get the square reader from the bands frontman) and we did originally intend to pay for the shirts, their merch guy just never showed up. i remember it once or twice a year and am overwhelmed by guilt... for like a minute.",11
"i conspired with our local brewpub to stop selling my husband growlers of ipa because the beer made him smell so bad.. i may get downvoted for this but here goes. my husband loves ipa beer but it makes him smell so bad it's not even funny. it just reeks out his pores and will actually make our sheets and his pillow case smell bad. it also really doesn't matter what brand or how high quality it is, whatever is in ipa doesn't mix with his body chemistry. 

his favorite beer by far is from a local brewpub. i'd say he was drinking about 2/3 growlers of their ipa a week. i finally couldn't take it anymore so one day at lunch i went in and asked to speak with the owner. he is a very super cool guy and he said that he also can't stand ipas because it's the reason so many bad breweries have been able to open because ipas take very little skill to make and people often cover up mistakes with the intense flavors. so he and i worked out a deal that any time my husband came in, he and is workers would tell him they were out of ipa but they would offer him a more traditional lager at a discount. our hope was that eventually he'd lose the taste for ipa and stop stinking up our house. i even offered to work out a deal with the owner that i pay him whatever he was losing in the discount and he told me not to worry about it. 

so it's actually worked. i've tricked my husband's taste buds into liking lighter beer and he seems to be past the disgusting ipa stage and he smells way better. 

suck it shit beer.

"i ended a girl's gymnastics career when i karate kicked a door open and broke her toe. we were at a gymnastics camp when we were teenagers and there was a swinging door that i had wanted to bust open with a sweet karate kick all week long. the only thing stopping me was that i was afraid there was going to be someone on the other side and i didn't want to hurt anyone. well the last day comes around and i said fuck it, and kicked that door as hard as i could. my friend and teammate was on the other side and the door caught on her big toe, pulling it back and breaking it so badly she couldn't compete for almost a year, missed regionals, and ended up quitting. she just assumed i had pushed the door open like a normal person but nope. i karate kicked that bitch. i still feel bad about it and it was about 15 years ago. sorry girl.",11
"i stole a microwave from walmart out of desperation. i while back while i was still in college i lived with my then fiancee in a very over-priced apartment in a relatively big city. at the time, my job was only paying about $7.50/hr and i was studying and working full-time just to pay the bills. basically a decent yet expensive apartment, and *just* enough money to pay the bills.. not much wiggle room.  


well one night my s/o was at work and i was at home, heating up some leftovers for dinner in our microwave and as i go to take the plate out, it slips and hits the door of the microwave on the inner edge and completely **shatters** the front of the microwave. so i'm freaking, expecting my s/o to come home mad at me and/or just stressing about having to buy another one. and then i saw a walmart receipt on the counter and i went to walmart.  


it was probably around 9pm, my s/o was going to be getting off soon, so i'm rushing. i walk in, find the *exact same* model of microwave that we have, and grab it off the shelf. i took the receipt out of my pocket and held it with the microwave, and just walked out the door. after getting it out and setting it up i told my s/o i cleaned the microwave. never told a soul about it. that was probably about 6 years ago... still using the microwave :/

edit: holy shit i didn't think this would get so much attention. i'm going to reply to some comments later today but i'm about to work a 10 hour shift so it'll be a while.

also yes my relationship dynamic at the time was toxic. i found that out about 6 months later. in a much better place now. thanks :)",11
"i met my current boyfriend by slipping him my number while he was on a date with someone else and i was their server.. i used to work at a cheesecake factory as a server. about 1.5 years ago my current boyfriend came in with some other girl for a date. i'm not sure what it is about my boyfriend but he just does it for me. he's not at all my normal type of guy i'm attracted to but for some reason he just makes me melt every time i look at him. 

he's got this super self assured smile and something about the way he talks gets me. he's got this little chuckle he does and he always looks down and bites his lip after...he's just like **it** for me. 

so i immediately rushed over to their table. typically, if i saw a guy i was attracted to i could give better service because i genuinely wanted to interact with him and everyone at the table and that usually lead to nicer tips. 

when i started serving them, i couldn't help myself and i was flirting super obviously. so much so my coworkers were telling me to be careful i didn't get complained on. but he flirted back so i was like a shark who smelled blood in the water. 

i spent so much time talking to him at their table other tables i was serving had to call out to me because i'd forget about them. 

honestly, looking back that was more of a date for me and him than her and him because we talked about what he did for work, what i studied, what my favorite foods are, what he likes, music. i must have been at that table, accumulatively, for around 40 minutes.

at the end of it she was being very short with me and him and i kind of figured she'd complain. so i said screw it, scribbled my number down and put it under his card when i gave it back to him.

he texted me that night and we've basically been dating since. i'm moving in with him on friday. 

it was honestly a very rude and shitty thing to do, but i'd do it over again in a second. ",11
"i sent a prostitute to my boss' hotel room. this was an accident and happened about 10 years ago.

i had recently joined a chinese owned company in a fairly prominent position and being the only white guy in the company, they liked to send me to trade shows in china to indicate that the company was definitely not chinese.

i was sent to guangzhou to the hotel dong fang just around the corner from the convention centre (extraneous detail not really needed but here to show this is genuine).

of course with a convention centre in town with many visitors, the prostitute madams/agents were out in force. most of the people handing out cards for whores where very young kids (seriously young. they looked about 10 years old or younger), often the only english they spoke was, ""you buy, so cheap"".

every time i went out, i had kids pushing cards into my hands, into my pockets or dropped into any boxes i was carrying. most of the time that was that. end of story.

on my my second to last day, i went out with the sole intention of buying presents for my wife and daughter, when after the first shop i was approached by an older madam who would not leave me alone.

every step of the way she kept with me encouraging me to ""buy, so cheap"". even my protestations that i was married and not interested was met with, ""your wife not here, you buy. so cheap"".

eventually, she said, ""tell me your room number. i send girl to your room. just $200"". thinking this was the best way to get rid of her i said, ""$200? ok, i'm in room 1024"" and then carried on shopping. since this was a fake room number and i had no intention of carrying out the transaction, i promptly forgot about it.

next day, last day of the show, i was told the boss had flown to beijing and i was needed to help a colleague collect some stuff from his hotel room. i walked with my colleague, dodging the kids with prostitute cards, back to the hotel until i was standing outside my boss's room.

room 1024.

i have never, ever dared ask or say anything to my boss about this. only my wife knows this story. and so, too, do you.

tl/dr: i accidentally sent a hooker to my boss's hotel room - pretty much what it says in the title.

"i lied about completing a project in the 8th grade and passed anyway.. i completely and 100% despised homework as a kid (and about half of my teenage years). when i was in the 8th grade, we were assigned a project towards the end of the year that counted for a pretty big percentage of our overall grade. from what i can remember, it had something to do with shapes and equations - it was basically like a large project of everything we learned the whole year. i didn't wanna do it. i worked on it a very small amount here and there, but never completed it. the math teacher collected them over a period of a few days, and then was going to spend a few more days grading them all. i played along to all of my other classmates that i turned mine in and even explained what it (maybe) looked like.

the day came and she was finishing up grading all of them, and as she finished each one she gave them back, so some students had already taken theirs home. so she's sitting at her desk and asks, ""spoopypuppy, have i graded yours yet?"" and i quickly replied, ""yes ma'am, you gave it back to me a couple days ago.""

some wonderful, powerful magic force was working hard that day, because all she said was, ""oh, i forgot to write your grade down. do you remember what it was?"" i didn't want to aim too high because i knew what work i was capable of, so i simply said, ""you wrote 89."" and she just wrote it down in her grade book!!!!! she didn't question to see it again or anything!!!

i couldn't believe it worked. that was the only time that ever worked, but it worked nonetheless. i passed math because of that lie. i did learn to just suck it up and do all the work from then on. ",11
"i stole and used my college roommate's fleshlight, then threw it out. it wasn't a real fleshlight, just a knockoff that looked like a mouth wearing bright red lipstick. he said he bought it as a joke and wasn't actually going to use it. one night we went out to a party - at the end of the night my roommate left with a girl and i went home alone. i was pretty drunk and horny, remembered his knockoff fleshlight, and thought borrowing it would be a great idea. i could use it then clean and return it and he'd have no idea. i grabbed it, lubed it up and went to town. it actually felt quite nice. shortly after finishing, but before i had a chance to clean things up, i hear the front door opening... roommate had come home early. i panicked and needed to get rid of the evidence as soon as possible, so i opened the window and threw the sex toy out. it landed in the center of our dorm's quad (grassy area where students sit, play frisbee, etc), and that was that.

the next day i went outside to look for it, but it was already gone. roommate asked me if i'd seen it a few days later but i just played dumb. don't think he ever found out what happened because i've never told anyone.",11

"nsfw i snooped through a teachers phone and found her nudes. this happened about 4 years ago when i was apart of the school newspaper my sophomore year of high school.

a little backstory: this teacher was the ""young hot teacher"" so i naturally was crushing on her, like most of the other guys in my school lol. she was super nice, definitely one of favorites and we grew into a nice ""teacher-student"" friendship. we still keep in contact actually, she's helped me with resumes and college quite a bit.

onto the story: one day i was assigned to do an article about our schools culinary program, they had made a big garden so they could have fresh veggies and herbs. i had finished writing the article and was told to go take pictures, but i had no way to take these pictures. the newspaper didn't have any cameras so students would just use their phones but i didn't have a smartphone at the time.

my teacher gave me her phone and told me to take the pictures with that. i took her phone and was making my way down the hall to the culinary garden when i had this thought. ""my teacher crush just gave me her phone, i'm alone, and there could be nudes on this thing..."" i've used an ipad before so i knew my way around an iphone. 

now what else would a horny teenager do? i started going through the photos, there were tons of pictures of her and her husband, friends, pets, etc. i started thinking ""she's not dumb enough to give her student something with her nudes on it"" but i kept scrolling, then it appeared, a full frontal mirror nude...

holy shit i thought i found the holy grail, my heart started beating so fast in that quiet ass hallway i swear you could've heard it. i clicked on it and instantly got rock hard. i proceeded to walk to the garden though so i kept it together and got those pictures. the whole time i was taking them i still had a boner (tucked into my waistband obviously)

now i'm walking back to my teacher, heart still beating hella hard, horny as fuck. ""this is going to be the only time i see my teacher naked so better get the most out of it"" i thought. i go into the bathroom, lock the stall, and rub one out over my teachers phone. it didn't take long at all and i busted the biggest nut.

i clean myself up, close the photos app, click the camera app so it looks like i didn't do anything but take pictures, then make my way to the class. i walk in and hand her the phone, she smiles and says ""get those pictures alright?"" i reply ""yep!"" i go sit down while she transfers the pictures to her computer and emails them to me. 

i finish my article and email it to our class editor and that was the end of it. she never found out and she never asked about it to this day. i've never told anyone this story before today and it'll remain a secret, i sure as hell don't want her to know i did this lol

edit: since a lot of people are saying that this was  a violation of her privacy and i was a creep for doing this - i know it was and i'll admit it was creepy. i'm not proud of it and actually feel a bit guilty, but that why i posted this here, to get it off my chest",11
"i secretly changed our bed. me and my wife bought a new bed. a really expensive one, the kind that has separate firmness on each side. we spent hours and hours in the store, where my wife took her time testing and deciding what kind of lower mattress she wanted on her side. beforehand, she had done extensive web research on what kind of bed would give her most happiness in life, and so on. eventually she settled for one with firmness between soft and medium. 
me, i couldn't be bothered with that. i've always liked my beds soft, but the store lady said that with my body composition, i should have a hard mattress. so during a brief brain fart, i chose that. 

next morning, i knew i had f***ed up. the $2000 bed i'd just bought felt awful. even worse, when installing it i'd taken the plastic wrapping off the lower mattresses so i couldn't return them. 

the solution - while my wife was at work i flipped the bed 180 degrees, so that now i have the soft mattress, and she has the concrete slab. there are two additional full width, thick mattresses on top of those, so it's not immediately noticeable. 

this was five years ago. i've slept like a baby ever since. my wife apparently still hasn't noticed, at least she hasn't said anything, and she seems to sleep well. she must never know, though. ",11

"my favourite thing working as a window washer was going through peoples private possessions.. so i worked as a window washer in my small town in sweden for about 5 years.

every morning you went to the warehouse were we had all of our stuff, drank a cup of coffee with your co-workers and talked for a bit before getting to know the places you had to go to that day, and who you had to do them with.

our bosses were very keen on everyone getting to know everyone so they changed up the ""teams"" every day.

this meant sometimes you got to go out by yourself.

a typical workday is going to 4-5 houses and/or apartments, sometimes old people (they were always home), sometimes familys who were home because they knew we were coming. not very often, you got people who left their key under the mat and let us go inside without them being home.

i likes this the most, since you didn´t have anyone breathing down your neck while you worked.

and sometimes, once in a blue moon, you got a house, with nobody home, by yourself.

i don't know if there´s something wrong with me (maybe).

but to me it felt like i had struck gold, because i knew, i would be able to walk around that house, by myself, checking out every inch of it.

i usally started by doing my job super fast! make sure i had some way of knowing if they got home.

usally i placed a ladder somewhere close to the door so if someone came home they had to move it.

then i got to work.

i never looked to steal anything, it was pure curiosity.

i looked through bathroom cabinets, nightstands, desk drawers and basically anything that you could open, while making sure everything i touched was placed back exactly where  it was before.

&#x200b;

during my years i´ve found diaries with dark secrets, cute secrets and just downright wierd secrets.

i´ve found used condoms in the teenage boys room, dildos and vibrators in the daughters/mothers nightstands.i found a gun under a matress (which in sweden is not something you see everyday)

one couple had a sex-swing hanging in the bedroom, so it´s not really something i needed to look for but i thought it was strange that they didn't take it down when they knew people were going to be in the house.

i once opened a teenagers macbook, and boom, pornhub, paused mid-video.

no password.

no incognito window, nothing.

jewelry, expensive watches and knifes.

one kid had a 3 knifes welded toghether like a ninjastar but with a handle.

"indirectly broke a dryer at a laundromat then gave a fake name and number to the owner. update- i honestly went back to the same laundromat this past sunday. did my laundry, didn't break anything went about my day lol. thank you everyone for the karma and upvotes


last night was doing laundry at the local laundromat.  i had 3 washers going at once. now normally, you fill the wash, add detergent, add quarters and select the cycle. when i pressed the cycle button normally the previously selected cycle button pops out kinda like a switch. i didn't notice it but it happened with this washer. so the washer had 2 cycle buttons pressed. about half hour goes by and washer 1&2  are done but washer 3 is still on the first part of the cycle. now it being 9pm and with the placing closing at 10 i decide to take the unfinished soaking wet clothes and put them in the dryer. about 2 minutes into the dryer the laundry attendant said i broke the dryer bc of the wet clothes. she took my wet clothes and put it in machine that just spins the clothes dry and then put them back in the dryer. she asked for my name and phone number so i wrote down ""trevor lahey"" and some random collection of 10 digits. those of you who watch trailer park boys will understand. so as the the last dryer is finishing the owner comes in ask me what happened. he couldn't believe that washer 3 didn't spin dry my clothes and was stuck in the same cycle for 1.5 hours until i had to physically show him how all the other washers work the same except for washer 3. he still even tried to spin it on me for breaking the dryer bc i didn't tell the attendant about the washer. so anyway he grabbed the piece of paper with my fake name and number and said that he'll give me a call tomorrow (today) to see how much the dryer is gonna cost to be fixed or replaced. lol fuck off",11

the first time i ever did this was when i was riding my bike in the neighborhood and saw a front door of a home wide open. i peeked in and said ""hello"" just to see if someone was home. no one answered. i stood in the living room just scanning the area and got spooked and left.

after that day, i was hooked on it. i would wait for people to leave and enter through which ever door/window was open and would walk around. i never stole anything but i did open drawers, closets and went through personal belongings. i once found a wad of money rolled in up a sock. i took the money and sock and put it in the next drawer over.

i felt like i needed to leave a mark so i ended up moving dishes in cabinets. like, i switched the cups with plates and moved utensil drawers to another spot in the kitchen. i did this in about 8 or 9 homes until people started talking and getting suspicious and of course, people started locking their doors, including our family.

"i recorded a porno over my aunt's wedding video. when i was 14 and 15 i stayed with my aunt cindy for a week while i was working a job. the commute to my job was very long and she lived much closer. it sounds weird to work so young and also to travel for work but it was a family business. 

i couldn't sleep as usual (lifelong insomniac) and i'm awake at 3am flipping through channels on her satellite package. flip flip flip wait a minute. was that a boob? flip back and see real honest to god porn. my aunt had subscribed the playboy channel. #jackpot

it's in the dead of night, no lights on, i've got the volume down as low as possible but this is in the living room and it's a big open area in the middle of the house. so i've got one eye on nasty office sluts get promoted and the other eye keeping watch. i hear someone get up and go into a bathroom. fuck!

i turn the tv off but the satellite is still on. i dig through her entertainment center looking for a blank tape, find one, and slip it into the vcr. i set it to record and then go to bed. i lay awake in bed terrified because if i fall asleep and someone turns on the tv before i get up, they're going to know it was tuned to a dirty channel. 

when the first pinky streaks of morning show in the sky i'm up and in damage control mode. i snatch the tape, change the channel, make sure everything is neat and tidy with the tapes underneath the tv. that's when i find a yellowed label that has fallen off a tape. it says ""cindy and darrel wedding 1985"" no no no no no. look at the ""blank"" tape in my hand, see the faint outline of where a label used to be. they line up perfectly. noooooooooo. 

suddenly i have this smoking gun of a horrible thing i did in my possession. anybody who watched the tape would see 30 seconds of her getting ready with her bridesmaids, cut to half of a porno set in the workplace, then it cuts out later to reveal mid wedding ceremony. what could be more sacrilegious?

"i am a hotel breakfast bandit.. it started after reading about this guy in georgia(https://www.wrcbtv.com/story/39049814/dalton-police-searching-for-breakfast-bandit) who was apparently stealing food from multiple hotels. out of pure curiosity and the desire to do something ""bad"", i decided to try it out for myself.

i live in a pretty big city (think top 10 in the u.s.) so there are no shortage of hotels around. once a week or so to ""treat myself"", i'll target a hotel. i'll walk in confidently pretending i'm a guest, sometimes i'll even make up small talk with the front desk staff like *hey just so i know, what time is check-out?*. i'll hang out in the nearby bathroom for 5 minutes surfing my phone. then i'll come out to the breakfast station and absolutely demolish the waffles, eggs, muffins, pancakes, fruits, etc.

my city has lots of medium-rated hotels with good breakfasts. the best ones have been:

- embassy suites

- holiday inn express

- hampton inn

- fairfield inn

- springhill inn and suites

- best western

- residence inn

all of these are within 10 minutes driving distance. if i rotate through them all on a weekly basis, i only really hit up each of them 5-6 times a year. spread out enough that the staff doesn't remember me; and of course there's lots of staff turnover each year so my chances of being caught are minimal.

"i almost strangled my mother to death when i was 15. reposting this here instead of in r/offmychest, cause this sub seems more fitting. i have been browsing offmychest and this subreddit for a few hours now, since i couldn't sleep. figured i might aswell chip in my story, since i don't often talk about this irl for obvious reasons. please mind that english is not my native language.

as you can guess from the title, it's not a very happy story. buckle up, this'll be a long ride. tldr at the bottom.

&#x200b;

my parents broke up very early, i grew up with my mom. my dad wasn't really present throughout my childhood. my mother has had a drinking problem for as long as i can remember. she had a rough upbringing and could only vent her frustration when she was drunk. the way things went down was always the same.

around once a month she comes home late, waking me in the middle of the night. from then on it's a shitshow. she starts yelling, spitting at me, beating me. smears her snot in my face or on my bedsheets and makes me sleep in there. one second she yells in my face that she hates me, that my father and grandma hate me, that it's all my fault and in the next second she starts crying and says that she loves me, emotional rollercoaster. this always goes on for the whole night. i don't remember too much but ironically the most prominent memories are the ones from when i was very young, maybe around 5 or something. one night i had to stand facing the wall the whole night while she screamed at me. i was so tired since i was just a little kid but everytime i tried to sit down she would hit me. sometimes i had to do squats while pulling at my ears, making me look really stupid. apart from the fact that it was humiliating, she made me do them until i collapsed from the pain, then she shouted at me to continue.

a weird thing she did was she frequently pretended to choke to death in the middle of a rant. she then lay there motionless for 10 minutes straight. as a 5 year old, i was completely in panic and had no idea what to do. i tried to wake her up but she didn't respond at all until she suddenly jerked up and resumed shouting at and hitting me for ""not helping her"". luckily she stopped pulling that one once she saw that i got too used to it.

as i got older she got more and more violent, but the only times i was really scared for my life was when she got the kitchen knife while fighting with her (now ex) fiancee. luckily no one was ever stabbed. i could go on and on but you get the idea. i never got any help because i was so used to all this stuff. and ofc my mother told me to never tell anyone. whenever i brought her bahaviour up in the next morning she claimed that she couldn't remember, said that i'm overexaggerating things, or outright claimed i was making stuff up. sometimes she apologized ""i will never do it again, honey"". i stopped listening after a while.

school was pretty shit aswell. i had no social skills because i preferred to play video games all day. i was a weird and misbehaving kid, so i was bullied a lot. also i was too afraid to stand up for myself, because i only knew punishment. the fact that we often moved didn't help much. all in all i went to 10 different elementary schools across 4 different countries. poland was especially shit. not the country, you polish folk are nice people :) but living with this rich alcoholic dude whom my mother constantly fought with was. thank god that episode only lasted a few months.

anyway, i digress. unsurprisingly i became depressed at some point and have been ever since. don't know when exactly, i think it was somewhere around 10 years old. this torture went on for many years.

she came home drunk one morning morning while i was getting ready for school. she didn't get much of a reaction out of me these days and didn't seem to like it. as mentioned in the title i was 15 years old at that time and getting physically stronger than her and i was used to the shouting. also i was basically dead inside. i was completely nonchalant when she started her rant. then she said something about my ex gf. it wasn't really all that bad but it was a weak spot for me since she recently broke up with me, it was my first relationship and i was the one who fucked it up. it was the last straw. all these fucking years of constant abuse and neglect unloaded themselves in one moment.

humans can be animals.

it was like watching a movie from a 3rd person perspective. i had no control whatsoever. i screamed while grabbing her throat and squeezing with all i had. i somehow strangled her across my whole room onto the bed. my big and scary mother whom i was always afraid of wasn't able to fight back against my rage. not one bit. now thinking back she even looked kinda scared. so she was on her back on my bed and i was standing above her, squeezing her throat. i have no idea how long that went on, maybe a few seconds, maybe half a minute. everything felt so surreal. at some point my brain kicks in: ""do you really want to do that?"" i get ahold of myself and i let go of her. fucking mistake.

&#x200b;

she instantly grabs a chair and starts swinging at me full force. i mean yeah, i technically tried to kill her but now i just want to get out of this alive. i block it and it fucks up my arm. then she fucking bites me in the very same arm jesus fucking christ that hurt. the bite later swole to the size of a ping pong ball. anyway i manage to get the hell out of that appartement but now i run the risk of freezing to death since we had winter and i'm wounded with nothing on me but my pyjamas. i encounter a neighbour and ask him to call the cops. i tell them what happened (leaving out the strangling part) and after they see my wounds they inform my mother that i'm being taken into care. my mom makes a pathetic attempt of trying to put on an act but snaps halfway through and bites an officer, gets wrestled down and arrested on the spot (it was honestly hilarious in hindsight, she played the victim and called me a traitor for calling the cops on her) but got out later on. she had to pay a huge fine though for attacking an officer.

&#x200b;

i moved out into government care. it was honestly cool. by the end of age 15, i had my own appartement for free rent, 400€ per month to do with whatever the hell i want and social workers that were pretty decent people (kudos to german cps). however shit caught up with me, my depression worsened badly, i started to drink a lot and later that year i tried to drown myself. that was rock bottom for me.

i've had bad phases since then, there were nights where i wanted to die, nights where i wanted to pay my mother a visit and get my revenge and nights where i didn't want anything at all. however all in all life's been gradually improving for me. slowly but steadily. the older i got, the more self-aware i became about my behaviour so i stopped getting bullied. also i learned to stand up for myself, that was helpful. however i still ended up quitting school at some point. i realized i can't force myself to do something i despise for even a second. i just stood up in the middle of class and went ""fuck it"". after that i tried a bunch of different jobs but none of them worked for me. however i found my true passion. i love making music, and i'm currently putting all my energy into becoming a successful musician. i no longer care if i might fail, it's really liberating! my relationship with my mother has been improving steadily aswell. boy it was hard at first, and i made sure to let her know how much i hated her for what she did, but she finally, truly admitted her mistakes and quit drinking. it was easier after that. i could start expressing and letting go of my hatred in a healthy way. she really made an effort to better herself. i also apologised for what i did that day and she forgave me.

i wish i could tell you a happy ending to that part of the story but sadly my mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia two years ago. the stress of coming to terms with what she did and the loneliness probably broke her. sometimes i think about what i could have done differently. she knows that i still haven't forgiven her and am still suffering every day because of what happened. but i can't change that. i told her it needs time. it's been only six years since the day police took me. she's back in her home country now with her family, they're taking care of her. thank god for that. the last two years were a huge burden. at one point she was so thin that you could see the shape of her skull, all while having that giddy delusional smile on her face. horrifying.

well, there it is. the story of how i tried to kill my mother. i apologise for the swearing, i got a bit emotional while writing this. granted, a lot of bad stuff happened in the past but it made me the way i am today, and i'm glad for that. i learned many things and i wouldn't trade that for the world.

people become who they are based on circumstances, but it is always in our power to change our fate. don't hate them, no matter what they do to you. cruel people are often hurting inside. instead encourage them to be the best they can be!

life's too short to be unhappy. strive towards your goals and never settle for less! it could always be your last day on earth, you literally have nothing to lose!

life's definitely not fair. cherish what you've been given and make the best of it. suicide will prevent you from ever becoming happy.

however i realize i'm still only 21 years old and have a lot to learn. i plan on doing so. i don't want to live a life full of hatred and regret, i want to be able to love and trust somebody again. i want to get married, have atleast 3 children, become a successful musician, travel the world, stuff like that. just be happy. i know i'll get there, one day at a time.

*tl;dr - i was constantly abused by my mother and bullied in school since my early childhood and snapped one day, almost strangling my mother to death. police took me in and after a while things got gradually better between us. i've pretty much made up with her. now i try to live my life as best as i can.*

&#x200b;

phew, i did it! it feels like i wrote up an entire novel. contrary to my expectations, i actually feel better now! if anyone made it 'til here, thank you for reading! :)

edit: i'm waking up this morning and jesus christ this blew up... i've read some comments and want to thank you guys so much for your kind words!! they mean a lot to me! i'll try to answer some comments later if there are any quesions.

also people have been asking me about my music. i prefer not to disclose anything here, i don't want to turn this into an advertisement for my songs. :)


editedit: i'm at a loss for words, man. just thank you all so much for your kind words, even those of you who had critical things to say! it's just surreal. these comments are coming in faster than i can reply but there is something i wanted to adress, since it popped up a few times.

i understand that a lot of emotions can be stirred up by such a delicate topic, especially if you experienced abuse yourselves. maybe it's partly my fault, because i focused too much on the negative aspects of our relationship. if so, then i apologize.

but please, if you can, don't write hateful comments about my mother. some things did go very wrong, yes. but she also did the best she could in raising me. there was always food on the table, she tried showing affection in her own way, she cared for my interests and education etc. and i firmly believe that she has always loved me. she just couldn't always express it, as she's as much a victim of abuse as i am. that's why it hurts me seeing comments like ""you should have killed her"" we have to be better than that! i know we can!

so i just want to make it clear that even after what happened i love her. after all, she is my mom.",11
"i stole thousands of dollars in change over 2 years working at mcdonalds. when i was 16 i got a job at mcdonald's. i hated making food and working front counter. i always asked to work drive thru window taking money at the first window. 
this was before credit cards so everyone paid in cash. all i would do is keep a quarter or dime of almost everyone's change i gave back. i would put that extra quarter or dime in a special spot in the register. once i got 5 or 10 worth of change i would dump the change into the right spot and pocket a 10 or 5. 
some nights i would leave with over 50 bucks in cash (a lot to a 16 year old me). no one ever caught on and only twice i can remember people telling me i gave them the wrong amount of change back. i would just act like a dumb kid whom miscounted . 
i don't know how nobody at work caught on because i always had a ton of change at the end of the day.



edit 1 - i never was trying to get over on mcdonald's it was purely selfish act.

edit 2 - this is a confession, not something i'm proud of now.

edit 3 - this was 16 years ago. yes credit card where around but not wildly used yet.

edit 4 - i don't think working fast food is a bad job for a teenager. nor do i think they abused me or mistreated me.",11
"i give overweight customers smaller bakery items. i work in a very popular bakery. my jobs include serving customers by packaging what they want into boxes, stocking the showcase with pastries, cakes, cookies, etc, and occasionally helping in the kitchen.

like any other bakery that does everything by hand, it's not easy to make everything a uniform shape and size for each product. when a customer comes in who is very obese or overweight, i low-key dig around for the smallest of the item that they want, such as the smallest cookies, fritter or donut. in my head i'm thinking, ""they don't need this, they're sick and could use a little less calories. they shouldn't be in here, i'll help them out by giving them a little less"". when really it isn't my responsibility and if they want something sweet that may not be very good for their already bad condition..then whatever i shouldn't hinder something that's going to make them very happy.

i can't say that i will likely stop doing it after confessing..i just still feel like if i don't try and do the little thing to help them, who will?",11
"i used to steal coffee from starbucks.. a couple years ago i downloaded the starbucks app and signed up for the membership to save my card and orders and such. after signing up, you get a coupon in your email for a free coffee of any make/size. at first, i didn't know you had to load it to the app after ordering, so when i went up to the counter and ordered my usual venti caramel frappuccino with an extra pump caramel and extra caramel drizzle. i proceeded to show the barista the code i had in the email, and he said, ""it has to be loaded onto the app."" i honestly had no clue how to use the code, but instead of going through the whole process on the app, he just let me have the free drink. i took this knowledge and used it on other starbucks throughout my town for almost a year. now, i'm not a total dirtbag because everytime i got a free drink, i'd buy a square of lemon cake and leave a couple dollar tip. :)",11

"i gave my brother the drugs that killed him.. it's been 4 years since he died. i know i'm responsible for it. he was 17. he wasn't very popular in highschool, but he'd been invited to his first big party. i was excited for him. he wanted to try get some more friends,become more popular. i helped him pick out what to wear, told him what to expect and do and all that shit. he'd asked me to buy him booze to bring with him, but instead i gave him some of my weed. he'd smoked a couple times with me before, i thought he'd be fine. i dropped him off, and told him to call when he wanted a lift home. that was the last time i saw him alive.

it was about 3am when my i heard my mum crying. from what i was told, he smoked and shared the weed with some people. they decided to go out to get food. my brother was the only one who hadn't had any booze so they asked him to drive. him and 3 people went out, during the drive they say he ""fell asleep or something"". he crashed into a pole, he died on impact and the person the front got their leg injured. the two in the back had minor injuries.

the police investigation was short. the car was okay and wasn't to blame, no signs of speeding, it had to be the drugs. i knew it was my fault. my parents tried to comfort me after i told them i'd given it to him, but i know they partly blame me too,things haven't been the same since.

i fell into a major depression. i drank and smoked pretty much all day. i lost my job. my parents tried to help support me financially but i spent all the money they gave me on booze and weed. my friends all disappeared after i stopped replying to their messages. it took over a year before i realised what i'd become. i started seeing a shrink. got clean. i'm 2 years sober. but every day i still know what i've done. every day i regret that decision.

i've written this out dozens of times over the last couple years. my doctor says it's good for me. i just want to post it online in hopes it does something. i don't even know what. i don't deserve forgiveness.

edit: i would like to thank all of you for your support and care and everything. i honestly didn't expect this and how many people would even read this. 
despite how many of you feel, i do truly believe i am responsible. i didn't make him go behind the wheel, but i gave him the weed that caused it. without that i truly believe he wouldn't have crashed. the police said there was no alcohol in his system and i honestly can't imagine he took any other drugs. but that is behind me now, it's a mistake i have to live with, ive come to terms with that.

edit 2:  i'd also like to clarify he didn't crash at 3am, that's when we got the call after the passenger had been pulled free because her leg got caught and was getting treatment. aplus it was in a semi-rural area, it would've taken police 30 minutes to get there. i believe that the police report said it happened around 1:30 to 2am.

a few have said that weed isn't a drug or wouldn't have caused this. but it is and it did. 2 years ago i would've agreed with you, but after therapy and getting clean i realised it is and that i was a drug addict, to both alcohol and weed. i've also come to terms with this. i hope that anyone in my situation gets help like i did. i used weed and booze as a tool to escape. i used it so i could pretend i wasn't myself for a few hours or just so i could sleep at night. but really it just hid my problems and that isn't healthy. there is help out there.

the only positive i can say from my story is that my brothers death woke me up. since getting clean i've started exercising, i'm going back to university next year, and my mind just feels more clear. it's kind of hard to describe.

i don't want to say 'don't do drugs' or make this a whole weed is bad thing. but don't use drugs to hide from your problems i guess is the point. seek help and help those who need it.

thank you all, truly.

edit 3: this will likely be my final edit to this post. once again, i'd like to thank all who commented for their advice, criticism and everything, it's all important as part of my therapy, even the negative.

what has disturbed me is fighting about weed, people have even messaged me to show their anger at me for saying it lead to the accident. saying that it doesn't make you tired, which is bullshit, i smoked and occasionally did edibles for 4-5 years, a lot of the time to help me sleep. whether it was him falling asleep for a moment and losing control, or a bad trip, or spacing out, or getting distracted, it doesn't matter. many people are insinuating he was drunk, but the police confirmed he was not i believe as part of the insurance claim for the car. i don't know, but they told my parents he hadn't been drinking.

i did this to try get some things off my chest, not so people could argue about how amazing weed is.",11
"i went through my mom's room, stole her meth, and had my brother sell it so we could buy groceries. we . were never caught by my mom or the police.. this is a sad confession, and i pray that no one is ever put in this situation. but you gotta do what you gotta do.",11
"i passed the hardest exam of the class with a bluetooth. my professor posts podcasts of her lectures online and i've been struggling with the material. during the exam i wore my hair down to cover the bluetooth, since it's one of those models that are small enough to fit right into the opening of your ear but still big enough where people know you're obviously wearing one. i had it well concealed behind my long hair and had it connected to my phone plus there's no policy about turning your phone completely off in class during exams; it just has to be on silent and away from your body and off the table. so i zipped my phone inside my backpack so she wouldn't see the screen light up in case anything were to happen and had her lecture playing on loop in my ear while taking the exam, got grades back 2 days ago and passed with 92/100.",11

"i sold my body. when i turned 18 i was homeless, so for 6 months i sold body as a prostitute, to get money, to get somewhere to sleep for a night, hell even to get a shower. it was the worst time of my life. i'm a man and as a male you would think wow that's awesome you scored so much. the complete opposite in fact every day i would see myself in the mirror and cry thinking i'm not capable of love, or even getting on my own two feet. i thought to myself i cannot afford some food for the night let alone to fall in love. having sexual experiences with someone you do not love is the most horrible feeling ever. i don't know about anyone else but i feel like i was somehow torturing myself. it was the hardest, most demeaning, most heart reneging thing i have ever done.  

edit: i still have problems with self esteem because of this, so when my gf wants to have sex. i usually have to convince myself that she wants me for me and nothing else. overall an 8 hour process. so i've decided to tell some of my friends who i don't feel will judge me who may not know. i've read so much support and good vibes sent my way. thank you all so much.

"i sabotaged my father's marriage because he cheated on my mother.. when i was four years old my father and mother divorced because he cheated on her. they had a really rough divorce and had lots of fights. eventually the divorce was settled and my mother and father could move on. my father married his mistress, who i'll call 'e' as to respect her privacy. my father was really happy with her and me and my sister got a stepbrother and two stepsisters with whom we got along really well. skip forward two years and 'e' started acting different and so was my father. me and my sister often couldn't visit our father because he had to 'work', whilst in reality he was free. when me and my sister were there we often weren't allowed to eat at the table, which seven year old me didn't understand. eventually my father started becoming more distant, he didn't wish me happy birthday anymore and missed a lot of important milestones in my childhood, like learning to ride my bike or plays at school. when i was nine my sister and i could only visit four days a month and had to sleep in seperate rooms. i vividly remember that during one weekend that we were there i had accidentaly broken a glass and 'e' had turned furious. she send me upstairs and had me take my socks of which nine year old me found really weird. then she showed me a piece of glass she held in her hand and said that this is what i deserved for my clumsyness. she pushed the shard of glass into the sole of my foot. i yelled and cried and tried to remove my leg from her grasp when i felt a hand on my shoulder. it was my father's hand, he was helping 'e' do this, i don't remeber what happened after that. 'e' also got into a huge fight with my sister and had pulled her by her hair down to the basement. after these two occasions and a lot of verbal abuse we decided to break all contact and tell our mother what had happened (we hadn't told her before because, well he was our father) . my mother knew this was serious abuse but she was too afraid to alert the police since my father had threatened her with violence before. skip forward another five years, i was fourteen and a freshman at the same school my former stepsiblings attended. once i saw them all the memories started rising again. my two stepsisters had become huge bullies and lots of people hated them. me and a couple of friends decided to retaliate and secretly put small bags of marijuana in their backpacks. apparently this had caused a huge fight in their home and my father and 'e' decided to divorce. after this 'e' got into serious financial troubles and my father became an alcoholic. two weeks ago he was arrested for assault. 'e' has alledgedly become a prostitute and my former stepsiblings have been brought into protective custody.  this has all been my fault, it was my idea to put the marijuana in their bags, even though they hadn't done anything to me. i ruined the lives of my stepsiblings and send my stepmother and father into a downwards-spiral. yet in some sick way i don't feel any remorse. my sister has been dealing with a severe eating-disorder after all the verbal abuse from  'e' and has been hospitalised twice. i've tried once to commit suicide because of my sexual orientation since i thought i was an abomination after 'e''s conservative christian rants. now me and my sister are doing better, though we still have traumas. we've thought about starting a lawsuit but because of our ages during the incidents legal advisors have adviced us to just 'move on'. anyway... i'm in a real moral dilemma: i did something that caused horrible things, yet i don't feel any remorse, am i a psychopath?",11
"a year ago i relapsed on heroin and recovered. i never told my wife or kids.. i have a wife and 2 kids, aged 14 and 11. i was a heroin addict from 16 years old to 23 years old, which was when my first son was born. my wife helped me get sober, and remains an amazing person and wife overall. 

&#x200b;

last year, my wife had surgery and got pain pills. i don't know what the fuck came over me, but i just wanted to try one to remember how good opiates feel. i was thinking, it wasnt heroin right? so maybe i wont relapse? i cant even describe how stupid of a decision it was. i wasn't depressed, or particularly yearning for heroin, but i just wanted to try it. literally right away it felt so unbelievably amazing that i took 2 more the next day. on day 3 i took about 4-5, i was high the entire day, feeling absolutely amazing. by day 5, i went to one of the local dealers and got heroin. literally only took me 5 days to get back on heroin. 

&#x200b;

my wife never got a hint. my kids never suspected anything. i was lucky this happened while my wife was recovering from her surgery, she was bed ridden most of the day so i was mostly free to do what i want. i didn't inject, i just snorted. i did it every single day for 2 weeks. the only suspicion was my daughter saying i was acting weird when i was high and when my son went downstairs at night and i was mumbling because i was nodding out. he just assumed i was tired. 

&#x200b;

i knew i had to do something. i wanted to just leave, run away to new mexico or something and just do heroin the entire time, then maybe come back. at the time it was literally all i wanted, i kept making these horrible, immoral excuses for my usage. like oh, my kids are old enough, and my wife is a good mom, they dont even need me! i can just run away and do heroin on an island forever. that was the kind of shit i would think. i knew it was bullshit, but its so damn powerful.

"i accidentally killed my pet mouse last night and i can't get over it.. my boyfriend and i owned two mice. however, they were both male so obviously they'd get into little fights and whenever things got bad we took the black one out because he had the mentality the whole cage was just his. this is the mouse i accidentally killed because he had begun to fight over food (even though we have two separate bowls of food for them) so i decided to go and bring out the black one to calm them both down. well when i grabbed him he bit me pretty hard and everything happened so fast. my reflexes squeezed as he bit me and then he fell when my hand opened really fast after that. at first i didn't understand what happened but his legs weren't working and i realized he made a 'pop' feel in my hand. i started crying and woke my boyfriend up and after he took the mouse i laid down and cried. i couldn't stop crying. how could i do something like that? yeah he was a pain in the a\*\* when he started the fights but he was the first mouse my boyfriend and i got. he ended up dying a 20 minute death because me squeezing him crushed his lungs and he suffocated. i just couldn't stop crying the whole night and couldn't believe that happened to me. now our other mouse has no company and i feel so bad. we ended up giving his body to a snake owner to at least purpose his death. i watched him struggle in his last moments. i held him as he began going limp and i held his lifeless body. i dunno when i'll get over this or if i can. everyone keeps telling me it's okay but i killed a creature i was supposed to help care for and i failed him. i'm so sorry. i also think my boyfriend kinda doesn't mind this happened because this mouse was such an a\*\* he never really seemed to like us and often only pissed us off but still he was our mouse and i killed him.

"i leave fake parking tickets on cars that deserve real ones.. i ordered a batch of them off amazon and leave them wherever. sometimes if nobody is around i make an effort and fill in all the details on it to freak them out before they get to the bottom and see it's a fake.

sometimes i just write something dumb in the comments and leave the rest blank.

i've left them on cars at my university that aren't *technically* illegally parked, and on cars that are parked in no parking zones at my grocery store. i especially do it when somebody is parked in a handicap spot that's not supposed to (no plate or hang-tag).

"i use my roommates face towel to clean up his pee. he still hasn't noticed.. i go to college in midwest united states. i live in a dorm an have a roommate who shares a bathroom with me. he's not from the united states and seems a little nervous to talk to anybody who isn't from his home country. the first few weeks of college, i started to notice pee on the toilet seat. no big deal, i cleaned it up. after about the 10th time, i asked him if he could stop peeing on the toilet seat, or if he does, wipe it up. he said okay and went on his day. about 3 months later, i started to notice pee all over the floor, toilet seat, and all around the toilet; worse than before. i used my own toilet paper and started going through it very quickly, so it was getting expensive. i ended up walking over to his side of the counter and grabbing one of his extra towels. i've been using it to clean pee for about 1 month now and i've definitely noticed a change in color due to the urine and the fact that i've never seen him wash it. i feel bad about it, but what he's doing is disgusting and i've tried to tell him to stop many times. should i feel sorry and stop?

"i used to charge a kid a made up ""fat tax"". a long time ago i was a high schooler at a boarding school. i was a decent kid in the eyes of the teachers and school administration. in fact they liked me so much that throughout my time there i was able to rise through the student ranks. i became a prefect, then i became the head boy, and at one point i had passed training that allowed me to run my own sports sessions or event where i was supervising younger and even a few older kids. this was just basic training for first aid, situational awareness, etc. at one point the school had so much trust in me that i was allowed to leave the school premises alone in the afternoons. this was huge and very few students had this privilege.

in typical fashion, as soon as i received the privilege i began abusing my powers as a free man. the school was very adamant on getting us balanced meals so we weren't allowed to get food delivered (all delivery vehicles were refused entrance). having the privilege of leaving the premises meant that i didn't have to order junk food and risk getting caught, i could simply go out to any fast food joint and bring food back with me. 

it all started out as an exclusive club, myself and my friends were munching on mcdonald's and kfc as the plebians were having the filthy healthy cafeteria foods. then i was offered something i couldn't refuse, money. not long after i had built a whole operation for bootlegging junk food into the school. we had cut off times for orders, a priority list for regular customers, extra fees for late orders, and even a spreadsheet for keeping a record of orders, payments, and profits. this smuggling was next level, we were organised, knew all the fire exits, where to walk to avoid corridor cameras, and how to pack the food so that it's unnoticeable when walking in (mostly used sports bags with a thin layer of clothes). the teachers new something was going on, there was food wrappers everywhere but no one knew how it came in. business was booming and i was making profits of 50 dollars a day, for 3-4 days a week. but it wasn't enough, i was hungry for more. there was a fat kid that ordered regularly, so i pulled the most asshole move you could do to your best customer. i started charging 2x the price for his orders and i would hide behind a bullshit moral barrier claiming we were doing this for his own good since we learned in economics that increased prices reduce demand and so he would be eating less and he would lose weight. the kid saw straight through the bs but in the end he couldn't resist it and continued ordering from me.

"no regrets i conned my way into being a therapist. while on a plane a few months ago, a depressed business man that was sitting right next to me started talking about his problems and how he failed to find a good therapist. 'i would pay a fortune just to find a good one' he said before asking me what do i do. 

yeah, you guessed what i answered. after that he asked me if i accept bitcoin and if we can do it remotely on the phone. 'even better', i thought, just like that guy from 'catch me if you can'. 

after our first calls, the guy was so impressed with me, he told his friend about me. 

i was now dealing with 2 clients and the guilt started to creep in. after a month or so of 'therapy', i confessed to them both. they didn't care.

'you're the best', they said. 

my secret? i'm a hard core misanthrope. and oddly enough, this makes them extremely comfortable. nothing is too shameful to share (i already assume the worst about people), i look at life from the perspective of a detached observer (i'm objective in my analysis), i am a great listener (i barely talk, because i know that what they need is to vent, not to ask for solutions), i am  well read, i traveled the world, i made money etc (i can empathize with whatever they are talking about), i like listening (i find it very educational) and i sell no bs (i'm way to pessimistic for that sh\*t).

so yeah. they are bringing in a third client. it's my pleasure.",11
"i changed my grade senior year of high school, with the principal in the room.. it was senior year of high school, and we were doing a partnered assignment in environmental science, tracking the river behind the school to find its source. there was an odd number of students and i was okay with working alone. 

that day the principal was ""observing"" the teacher, evaluating her performance. my teacher trusted me, and gave me her laptop to do the assignment, and asked if i would show the principal what we were doing. i agreed and quickly finished my assignment. 

the principal and teacher were standing by the door chatting, so i open the powerschool app. there it is... all my friends grades, including mine, staring at me in an excel style format. 

i notice copious amounts of 0's by my name, dragging my grade down somewhere in the low 70's. (i was a minimal effort high schooler) i quickly changed most of the 0's to 70's or 60's. this way it wouldn't look too suspicious. 

my heart was racing as i saved the updated grades, and i didn't tell anyone for a few years including my best friend/ brother. i never got caught, and i still grin thinking about it 6 years later.",11
"i unknowingly did cocaine in the 4th grade. i think i was 9.. during class in elementary school, a friend of mine said he had something to show me and so after school ended, we met up in the bathroom and he pulled out what looked like a golden or brass apple from his backpack. the top unscrewed and inside it was this white powder. he took a pinch and sniffed it and told me that his parents and their friends sniffed it and it made them happy. so i said okay and took a small pinch and sniffed the powder. it was bitter and burned a little but it gave me a jolt of energy. afterwards, we went bike riding and i felt all this crazy energy. we rode and rode around for what seemed like forever at seriously top speed! but then later, we got to a hill that we couldn't ride up because it was too steep. we walked our bikes. the sun beat down on us and i suddenly felt tired. then i felt this pain in my head. it was the first time, i tried cocaine and also the first time, i ever got a headache. i told my friend about the pain and he showed me a pressure point on my hand and to this day, every time i get a headache, i use that pressure point on my hand. sometimes, i remember that day in 4th grade when i did cocaine but most times, i don't. ",11
"in high school, i wasn't let into a party so i called the cops pretending to be a concerned neighbor which ultimately led to a racist cop beating the shit out of a classmate.. so this is coming from a throwaway because even though this was way back in 1991, there are still people who are pissed about this. apparently it was even discussed at the 25 year reunion and people we're genuinely still pissed. 


in 1991 i was a junior in high school in albuquerque, nm and i lived in the far northeast heights. there was a girl christy that was a year older than me but i had known forever because she lived about a block away. we found out that she was throwing an invite only party for seniors and as a group they had spent a small fortune on a keg of good beer (back in the day that meant corona), high end liquor and even decorations. it wasn't a normal high school kegger by an stretch. i figured that even though i was junior i'd known her for so long it wouldn't be a problem if i showed up with a few of my friends. 

nope, they were not letting us in for love or money. the kid ""working"" the door was even on the baseball team with me and he was total dick. when i asked to see christy she told me in no uncertain terms to get the fuck out. 

so we were pissed. we drove to the nearest pay phone and i called the police to report a super loud party that had spilled into the streets and now a group of teenagers were fighting on ""my"" lawn. the dispatcher wanted to know the address and then my address so i made up one on the same street, said my name was mr sevedra and hung up. 

we laughed and figured i'd sounded way too young to be taken seriously and decided that we'd tried. we went to hang out at our school's mcdonalds and figure out what to do next. 

maybe an hour later a steady stream of cars started pulling and we recognized them all from the party. the cops had apparently come screaming down the street shortly after my call and had surrounded the house on all sides. they even blocked off the neighbors behind the party house because they knew kids would jump the wall to escape. the police response had been so intense even my parents heard the commotion from a couple blocks away. 

we sat there trying to go along with the horror and not reveal our shock as the party goers talked about how it was such bullshit because they had specifically kept the party low key to not attract the police. the police had made them pour out all the booze so they were out a huge amount of money. and is if that wasn't enough, the police had found a kid of hispanic decent that went to our high school coming out of the neighbors yard and had basically beat the ever living shit out of him because he wasn't in the ""right"" neighborhood. he showed up to mcdonalds maybe 30 minutes after the main group because they had detained him but not arrested him and his face was completely scuffed up, his clothes were ripped and he was furious. 


my friends and i sat there the whole time just saying ""that sucks"" knowing that we had basically just caused a major incident simply because we didn't get admission to a party we weren't invited to anyways.

"i've been logged into my ex's facebook account for 2 years, reading all her messages and notes. the recent mass-log-out meant i lost access and i feel a massive weight lifted off me, and i've also realized how sick i have been spying on her every word.. me, female 21ish

when we were dating i let her use my phone to log into facebook, and she never logged out. she isn't particularly tech savvy and never noticed there was an extra device logged in, and didn't change the password.  


after we broke up, i was pretty emotionally distraught, but i understood and tried to be amicable. it made it harder that she later began dating my best friend \m\ and even though they were a much better match and i was happy for them, i felt increasingly left out of our social circle and was desperate for any emotional intimacy.  


when i realized i still had access to her facebook, i first was just curious about what she had said about our breakup to her new bf (my best friend), so i thought it couldn't hurt to take a peek.  


i saw that they were in the middle of sexting each other over fb, while i was reading, and the level of their explicitness made me unable to look away. i wanted to read everything that was being said as if it was me on the other end instead of him (i know, awful); but the further back i looked, i realized that they had been sexting for weeks, all the way back into our relationship.  


i felt hurt, but i also understood more why it happened. we weren't a good match to start with, and we were having other problems, so as much as the betrayal hurt, i never said anything because i read the remorse they seemed to genuinely have for what they did in their messages.  


however, i realize now that i also used this injustice against me to justify my own actions, my reading every single message they sent to each other over the last 2 years, and every message previously. only now that i have been forced out by facebooks mass log out push because of security issues do i now see just how much i violated their relationship and how awful it was.  


i justified it to myself along the way by always being there for both of them to give relationship advice when i knew something was wrong (because i read it) or when i knew that they were having a fight and i wanted to be supportive.  


it is only now that it is gone that i realize that i have been neglecting actual relationships with people because i was living through reading the messages with others, obsessively   


i feel more than ever like i need to move on and do everything differently, perhaps admitting to them what i've done.

"i waited for a woman to enter the dressing room in goodwill and switched a pair of mens shorts i wanted out of her basket with a similar looking pair, immediately bought them and left.. i actually looked at the shorts before she was even in the store but decided not to get them until later when i looked them up online and saw they were regularly $50. they looked brand new and goodwill was selling them for $5... when i went back to get them they weren't there but i happened to see them in this woman's basket. pretty sure she was a bargain shopper. i'm fucking pathetic.

edit: i still feel bad about doing this but another part of me doesn't give a fuck because her basket was full of clothes. i'm willing to bet that she doesn't even wear them (considering she bought men's shorts) but instead re-sells them. out off all those shorts that one was the only one she picked up. she probably did the same damn thing and looked them up. and no i didn't change my mind because i want to ""flex"" by wearing expensive stuff. at least i'll actually fuckin wear them unlike her.

"i tried to miscarry my baby and hurt her permanently. when i was 15, i got myself pregnant unintentionally. i was a very promiscuous horny teenager and i wasn't exactly safe about it. sometimes i used condoms, sometimes i didn't. i got really worried when i started experiencing the usual symptoms of morning headaches and nausea and skipped my period, so i took a pregnancy test and what i feared was true, i was pregnant.


i had no idea how to react to this. for one i was utterly terrified and i wanted to get rid of it. in a way it felt parasitic, the thing inside me with the power to fuck my life up. i have very christian parents who would have disowned me for having an abortion, but i knew they would actually love to raise this kid. however, i hated the idea. i had problems with eating at the time and didn't want to gain the pregnancy weight and i just didn't want a child.


i guess i'm making excuses, even now. i started a smoking habit very promptly, since i'd heard in science lessons that one of the effects of smoking can be miscarriage. i barely ate at all, and if i did i threw it up, all in the hopes of starving it as if i was trying to get rid of a fever. it didn't work. i gave birth to her far too early and as a result she is blind. i gave her away and haven't heard from her since, she's 8 by now. my parents were surprisingly supportive and i got the help i needed for my eating disorder and i still go to regular therapy. i just had to get it off my chest.


edit: i've realised now that this confession has come across as unremorseful. it was hard writing it, and as a result i focused more on what happened than my emotions. i want to make it clear that i really really regret my actions. it's very hard to live with what i've done, and when i was 17 i attempted suicide because i simply couldn't handle it any longer. what i've done to my child tears me apart every day. i still have nightmares, i still can't sleep at night. i can't tell you how many times i've wished and prayed to go back in time. however, i've focused on improving myself through therapy and i am training to be a nurse to help children. i know that doesn't make up for it, but i'm trying hard to be better.


edit 2: this is not the way to deal with this situation. first of all, always always always use contraception unless you are willing to accept the responsibility of a child, which is a life long commitment. if you're a woman, don't trust the man to bring it each time and keep it in a safe, secure location. bring your own condoms, get on the pill, get an implant, whatever works for you. if you do get pregnant, don't be afraid to reach out for help. speak to your doctor or teacher you world. if you feel like you can't talk to your parents, but if you do think you can speak to them don't feel ashamed. don't do what i did. getting pregnant is not the end of the world. don't let it be the end of yours.

"in high school, i forged all of my report cards. back in high school, i wasn't a great student and report cards always got me in a lot of trouble. around the 9th grade i started intercepting the mail, scanning in my report card on my windows pc, then carefully changing all the grades and comments from my teachers using text & numbers that were already on the page. afterward, i'd very carefully print it out so everything was in the correct spots, then folded it up and put it back in the envelope. 

at one point in time, my mother was corresponding with one of my teachers via email to track my progress. i went as far as to make an email address that matched my teachers, just from a different domain and would delete the real emails from my teacher and forge fake emails that made me look better.

somehow, i never got caught",11
"i took the most necessary items from a lady's shopping cart in an act of petty revenge.. i was walking down the aisle and she rounded the corner and blocked me, then left the cart in my way while she popped back around the corner for something off the shelf.

i took the butter and milk from her cart and returned them to the shelves, so that she will get home without her essentials.

this served no purpose, she will not learn anything, it was just petty and i am ashamed of it.",11
"i guess i am my brothers keeper. i used to watch over my little brother (who at the time we didn't know has aspergers) when he was at school. kids would always pick on him and when he came home with bruises, i ditched school (i was in high school and he was in middle school) and snuck onto campus during recess and lunch times, but always stayed a ways away. 

i saw some little asshat push my brother down and watched as he got back up, picked up his books and walked away, even though the boy was following him and smacking the back of his head. after my brother made it into the classroom, i ran up, grabbed the kid by the back of the neck and without thinking, head butted him. once he started to cry, i pulled him in and told him if he ever lays a hand on that little boy again, i'd break every last one of his sad little bones. i've never told anyone about doing that. 

after school, i watched my brother begin to walk home and the little shits friend walked up to him, yelled something about ""some dumb older girl"" (i can only assume he meant me) and he pushed my brother into the street and a car had to slam on its breaks to avoid hitting him. 

at that point, i lost it. i pulled my brother onto the sidewalk, made sure he was okay and told him not to move. i ran over to the little shit (i didn't care that he was younger. not one bit), grabbed him by his hair and yanked him to the ground and started beating the ever loving crap out of him. at some point, i broke his arm. 

the driver of the car that almost hit my brother had called the police and pulled me off of him, but backed me up 100% and told the officer the truth about what he saw. i got insanely lucky. the police officer told me he has a little sister with autism and he probably would have done the same thing. 

didn't even get punished in the slightest, was just told to take my brother home and to promise never to hit anyone again. (the best i could give was to never get caught hitting anyone again). 

we stopped by the 7/11 on the way home and i got us both some ice cream. i don't know if he remembers that day now but i'd still do it all over again in a heartbeat. ",11

"i framed my mother's ex husband when i was 5. so, for a little background, my moms ex husband was a jerk. later on in life, i found out that he was even worse than i thought, but even to 5 year old me, he was a jerk. for example, there was one summer that he spent all of our money (meaning his and the money from the three jobs my mom worked at the time) on cigarettes and booze and other dumb shit, leading to me and my sister having to spend the summer at my grandmother's because there was literally no food in the house and my mom had to live off of bread and butter for about 3 months. he was that kind of guy. 

so, when i was a kid, i always got up much much earlier than everyone else. i can't remember why, but it was probably just so i could watch cartoons in peace. one morning, i went into the living room to find this dudes pocket knife on the couch. it was closed, but i got curious. 

i opened it and i was playing with it, when i had a thought. obviously i can't remember the actual train of thought, but it led to me deciding to cut my hand, right in the center of my palm, so that mom would be mad at meat-head-mcdonald. i immediately started bleeding, and a lot. (now, i know that i bled so much bc i have a blood clotting disorder, yay me) i started screaming, mom came down the stairs along with dick-wipe, and they saw what happened. 

i told mom that he had left the knife open on the couch arm, and i had put my hand down on it on accident. this led to one of their biggest fights, with mom saying that he was endangering me, and micro-penis saying he swore he didn't leave it open. 

so yeah. i still have the lovely scar on the middle of my hand to remind me that i was more of an evil genius when i was a child than i ever will be again. fun.

"i used to eat my coworkers apple chips at work, then tell him that i was allergic to apples so he wouldn't accuse me.. just to be clear, this wasn't because i was particularly hungry, its because my coworker was an absolute asshole. he was really creepy toward the girls in the office and always said some pretty weirdly racist shit to our other coworker who was from mexico. he was just a crude, horribly annoying person who seemingly took enjoyment out of making everyone around him uncomfortable. he was like a mix of todd packer from the office and tony soprano. he always brought these apple chips into work to eat for lunch, and occasionally i would go in, take the apple chips, and go to the nearby park and eat them for lunch. he would go around asking everyone if they took the chips and would act all pissed off because he knew someone took them. 

instead of just flat out telling him i'm allergic to apples, i put on a little show. he was eating his chips 2 days before i started to take them, and i asked if i could have one, and i took one and almost took a bite, then said ""these aren't apple flavored are they?"" and he said they were, then i quickly put it back on the plate and went to go wash my hands and i said i was allergic. much more believable than me just flat out telling him.

"i saw a women get raped and didn't call the police. she was killed afterwards.. this was in 2007, in chicago. i used to live in a cruddy neighborhood with a lot of abandoned warehouses and such. 

i woke up to the sounds of this weird screaming and yelling in spanish coming from the alleyway near my house. i had no idea what she was saying, but i looked over, and a girl was bent over backwards getting fucked. i just figured she was yelling in happiness or something loudly, and closed my window. about 10-15 minutes later, i heard her scream way louder, like a lot. i looked over out the window again and she was gone, and the guy was still there. i had no idea what had happened. i just closed my window again and went back to bed. 

next day, i woke up to cop cars all throughout the block. i figured something bad had happened, but i really had no idea what, and i was scared to ask because i felt i might be pressured to be a witness or something. i just stayed in my house and looked out my window. 

i would end up searching newspapers and internet for the next few days trying to find out what happened. i found out. the guy was a john, she was a prostitute. he broke her arm in the car, dragged her to the alleyway and raped her, then took his baseball bat and started hitting her over and over again. she managed to escape into the street, but he found her and bashed her head in with the baseball bat and killed her. he was arrested with a bloody baseball bat in his apartment and some heroin. 

i could have called the police the first time when i heard her yelling and saw them fucking, and none of this would have happened. cops typically take 10~ minutes to respond to stuff like that, and they were in that alleyway for at least 15 minutes. the house next to me was a vacant, so i was the only one who could have called the cops.

"when i was 19 years old i lied about having a summer job and smoked weed at a parking lot 3 days a week for 8 hours a day.. at first, my apologies in advance for any grammar mistakes, english is my second language. 

so, i grew up with very kind and sweet parents. we are a wealthy family but the one thing my parents are obsessed about is working, their whole life is just about work. and in my teen years i was the most lazy person ever, never did anything, school was way too easy everything just went well my whole life without effort. 

when i turned 19 and it was summer, the perfect moment to just relax, smoke weed and drink beers with my friends. but no. my parents insisted that i should get a summer job, probably because they were just annoyed by me doing nothing. so, i did what they said and applied for a job at a local restaurant as pizza delivery guy. the owner was a total jerk and insulted me all the time, after 3 days my shift was over and i never came back. told my parents about the situation and of course they were not happy.

2 weeks passed and i still haven't got a job and they began to annoy the frick out of me, they didn't care about anything else then me getting a fricking summer job. finally i came to the decision to just lie about having a job at a storage facility. they were so happy for me so i just continued the lie. 

i went off for work, drove my car to the train station and put my car in the parking lot and just smoked weed, listen to the radio and watched some movies i downloaded on my laptop. i told my parents my boss paid me in cash every month, i had a student loan at that time my parents didn't knew about, since i was 18+ that is allowed in my country without my parents consent, and that was exactly the right amount of money i would get for those hours i went ""working"" for. 

i did that for 3 months straight, even when school started again. i went off every saturday and watched movies and smoked weed. they still haven't figured it out yet.

it was a familly buisness and they were very mean and  have no patience. i ordered a delivery, it came 1h later and cold. called him out about it . dude got mad, start yelling and refused to take it back. he throwed the change at me and stormed away. i called his father (pizza owner) to complain, and he told me that his kid dont get mad if he wasnt right, and told me to put the pizza in the microwave and hung up. i was mad af.  i decided to wait untill i cool off and think about what to do. so the next morning, i called the pizza from a phonebooth and ordered almost 80$ worth of pizza. i gave them the adress of the appartement next to me wich was empty. i turned off my tv so i can hear him coming. he came more than an hour later and start knocking the door. of course no one responded. he insisted by knocking loudly. so i opened my door, and sees him with a ton  of pizza. i just laughed and closed my door. he automaticaly knew that it was me but couldnt prove it. i could hear him yelling, insulting while leaving the building...
that day was satisfying af. i ordered domino to celebrate.

"i shit in a mason jar and left it in my friends pantry.. here we go. 


about 13 years ago my 19 year old self was partying at a friends house. there was probably a good 20-25 people packed inside this 1000sqf house. 

i had been drinking mikes hard lemonade and tampon blender benders all night long. full disclosure; i have an allergy involving certain alcohols that can cause severe hives, swollen throat, and intense diarrhea. i was 19, and stupid. 

anyways, i was chatting with my gal pal at the time and felt the inevitable groan of my stomach. 

""shit"" i thought. figuratively and literally. 

i asked where the bathroom was, and she pointed down the hall. 

i squeezed myself through the teenage crowd only to find a ridiculously long line of women waiting to use the toilet. 

my bowels were screaming. 

the cramps were intensifying. 

i recalled seeing a toilet closet in the basement of the house once before and decided to take my chances. i darted down the stairs all while puckering my pooper with all the strength in me. 

it was dark so i flipped the light switch and saw the porcelain throne glowing in the corner of the room. i slam the door behind me and shove my pants down around my ankles. i make a swift penguin waddle over to the toilet. 

to my surprise, the toilet isn't connected to the plumbing! it's just sitting in the corner of the room. a failed attempt at a bathroom remodel, i had put myself in a perilous poo-position with no escape.  

people saw me come down here, there's no way i could poo in the toilet and get away with it. 

by now anus was on fire. i could barely hold it in much longer. 

i panicked. 

i scanned the room and noticed an open mason jar filled with potpourri with the lid laying beside it on a shelf. 

my mind was made up. 

i snatched the mason jar from the shelf and promptly dumped the potpourri into the empty toilet bowl. 

ever so carefully i placed the mason jar on the floor of the bathroom and popped a squat over it. spreading my cheeks and with surgical precision, i shat my brains out in that jar. i filled that sucker to the brim. i released the kraken of anal sighs and never felt such relief before in my life. 

but what now? what do i do? i can't leave it in here! 

i hear my friends calling me from upstairs that they were wanting to leave. i needed an escape plan, now! 

quickly i pulled up my pants (wiping was not an option, but i'd pinched off like 99.99% of my shit, so it was *clean enough*) and placed the lid on the mason jar. it was warm. so warm. still unsure of what to do next, i hide the jar under my hoodie and exit the bathroom as if nothing happened. 

""what were you doing down there?"" my friend asked. 

""just freshening up"" i said, in absolute horror that she may notice my mason jar shit smuggling. 

""hurry up, we're all in the kitchen waiting to leave"" she barks. 

i swim through the crowd of people to the kitchen to meet my friends. they're all crowded around the pantry door which was next to the door to the garage. 

""there you are!"" they holler as they open the door to the garage. 

here's my chance. the door to the garage was blocking the visual to the pantry. 

i did it. i slide the smuggled shit jar out from under my sweater and place it next to identical jars in the pantry. and promptly left with my friends. 

to this day, i wonder. i wonder with so much wonderment that i wonder how i've never been caught. 

did they ever locate this jar and open it? was it assumed beef stew? was it tasted? smelled? tossed? 

i regret this. but i was desperate. 

this is my poo-fession.

"i used to be a white supremacist - please read the whole thing before posting. about a year ago i joined a group of men that advocate for white nationalism and other far right nonsense. too be honest i didn't care or like any of these people in the slightest. the only reason  joined them was because some of  my friends were going to that ""side"" of the political spectrum and they were getting angry about stupid political shit like i was. i did a lot of crazy stuff like vandalism and basically getting drunk with other skin heads and aryan brotherhood drug dealers. i slide down this kind of spectrum, i acted like a fool and made myself look stupid. eventually after a few crazy events happened i stopped talking to my white nationalist friend and started doing my own thing for a while through mostly work. i got this crazy idea to actually go to a synagogue, a mosque , and a church just out of fun. when i went to these places almost all of those people treated me very well, including an elderly jewish couple. they treated me like a part of their own family and introduced me to their kids. the muslims treated me the same way and even gave me some free classes about the quran. but i think the worst part of all was when i went to a catholic church and i saw every race on the face of the planet in this small town i used to live in. and i felt so bad about this whole thing. because i had judged a lot of these people before they even knew me. but in all honesty i'm sorry i did some bad things to these people and i don't want any harm to them. i guess i'm glad that god helped me realize what i did was wrong and i don't want anyone to do the same things i did. but again i'm sorry for what i did i hope some of you can forgive me.",11

"i sold a plastic bottle cap to a mentally handicapped kid when i was 8.. at the age of 8, i decided i wanted to make money for whatever reason goes through the mind of a kid. 

there was this mentally impaired kid living in my street, who was always very nice to the neighbourhood and waved her hand with a big smile to everyone. she could barely talk intelligibly but could understand simple words.

so one day, going through the mess of my bedroom i found a plastic bottle cap. i walked up to the kid and told her it is a very important object and that her parents really need it. her parents would be really happy to have it. they would be angry if she loses it. 

now, for mentally handicapped kids, their parents, their house, their neighbourhood is the only world they know. it is the limit of their universe, this is all they got. they are innocent. they cannot imagine what being mean or dishonest is. 

i told her she needed to give me coins to get the cap. she came back with a bunch of coins in her hand. she looked so happy. she couldn't count, so i took all of it. 

it has been 20 years now, and i have deep remorses for what i did. taking advantage of an impaired and innocent child who cannot imagine people can be deceiving. i can imagine her cheering that ridiculous cap, like its gold. showing it to her parents because she loves them. 

the kid has passed away because of her disease and i will never be able to repair what i did.

i thought i would buy the cap back from her parents. whatever cap will do, even if it's not the one i gave her. but it would sound like nonsense to them. too long a story to explain. they probably don't even know this ever happened. but i do.",11
"i purposely damage food packaging at work. i work at a large retail chain, and we were purging the whole grocery section in the stockroom. this included getting rid of things that weren't sold there anymore, was expired, or otherwise unsellable. as long as it was still safe to eat, we donated it to a food bank.

so once i got to the top shelves of product, i would ""accidentally"" drop casepacks of food, crushing boxes so couldn't go out onto the salesfloor, and would have to be donated. if management knew, i'd definitely lose my job.",11
"i cheated on my exam in a way i never thought was possible. this was about four years ago in high school. now i am from poland and we had a test of english idioms. i considered myself quite good at english so i never really paid attention to when the exams were scheduled as i managed to get good marks without studying at all.

the idiom one, however, caught me off guard. i knew about two out of ten examples and i just wasn't okay with the mark that i was gonna get. i quickly wrote down the idioms on a separate paper and never handed in the original one. the teacher then proceeded to mark the tests at his desk and that's when i wrote my answers on that separate sheet of paper with the help of my notebook.

as i finished i approached my teacher and asked him some typical questions about my marks and etc. that required him to look at his computer screen. at that very moment i dropped my perfectly written paper under his chair and returned to my own desk. about 15 minutes later i watched him pick it up with slight confusion and eventually he assumed that he had dropped it before, exactly as i had planned.

i ended up getting the best mark and honestly am still proud of myself for handling it like that. i've learned the idioms too.",11
"i took $30 out of my colleague's farewell gift contribution when i found out she blocked me on facebook.. 
so i (22f) work at a big law firm as a paralegal. my colleague (30f) is also a paralegal. we've both been working there for 2 years. she can be dramatic and gossip-y but other than that she's good at what she does. 

she started treating me different ever since my proposal to go part-time got accepted by the executive (due to studies). a lawyer that i'm close with even told me that my colleague said that i suck up to the lawyers (idk how true this is. maybe it was just a misunderstanding? i'm just kind to everyone). 

so she got accepted in a different job last week and she'll be leaving soon. we're all contributing to get her a farewell gift and she really wants this expensive make up set from sephora (she can't afford expensive make up because she lives paycheck to paycheck) .well this week i found out that she blocked me on facebook for no apparent reason. i thought two can play at that game. the next day at work, i took back my $30 contribution towards her gift and we're now short on her make up set. nobody knows how much i donated because i'm the one who is in charge of counting the money and collecting donations. 

hey kate, you're getting a gift card to a department store instead.

edit: i took my own $30 contribution back which i donated in the first place. yes i know it's better to kill with kindness, but i'm not going to put my  own hard earned money to reward someone who attempted to destroy my image in a field which i will be potentially working in.

"i once trucked a girl in high school and it keeps me up at night. in high school i played football and i was pretty tall and big. when walking to classes it actually kind of sucked because i had to stop to let people go into doors so i wouldn't run into kids because i could accidentally knock somebody over. 

i had another friend on team who walked with me to class and we would occasionally fuck around in the hallway by pushing each other, just dumb shit. we were messing around when he pushes me when we're making a turn down the hallway, and i backup and feel something against me. 

i look down an a poor girl, who was probably a freshman, is laying on the ground. absolutely terrified. i go down to help her up and my friend still doesn't understand what's happening and thinks we're still messing around, so he pushes me again and i almost ended up trampling her. she got up on her own and rushed down the hallway probably with tears in her eyes because i had just knocked her into a brick wall and onto the ground. 

i never got reported to a teacher so i'm assuming she had no injuries. this wasn't the last time something like this happened. i was walking to class after lunch when a friend came over and pushed me as a joke. i said ""get away from me"" at the exact same time a girl accidentally hit me while walking by, looked at me super offended and walked off.",11
"i learned something about my mom's past, and i feel like i've stolen something from her.. for context, i'm a 25yo woman.

last month, i was at my parent's house. i was helping my mom with something when i noticed a piece of paper barely sticking out of a folder. all i could see was a title that ended with the phrase ""as rape survivor"" and something that looked like my sister's name next to the right margin on the second line.

yes, i know, i shouldn't have read it. but i dare you not to do the same in my position.

there was a split second where i considered pretending i'd never seen it. but selfishly, i thought i \*had\* to know.

and naively, i thought that whatever i could imagine could be worse than what had happened.

after all, my mother was and is a popular likable extrovert who drank like a fish in college and always had a date to dances. and well, norms have changed. there are experiences that might seem like rape in hindsight that would not have been considered so at the time.

i was expecting a story involving fuzzy boundaries and fuzzy memories, the edges worn down by the decades passed since. it wasn't that i wanted to invalidate her experience precisely, but mentally minimize it so that i could neatly consign it to the same place where i keep stories about her grad school roommates.

until i started reading.

it was the kind of rape that people often imagine when they talk about rape. behind her apartment. by two strangers. at gunpoint. on her 24th birthday. my mother, the woman who believes that people are fundamentally good. my mother, the most empathetic and emotionally intelligent person i've ever met. my mother, the woman who leaves our front door unlocked at least 80% of the time. she was raped at gunpoint when she was six months younger than i am now.

she talked about how it tested her support network - how her new boyfriend dumped her and how people—female and male alike—asked what she was wearing. how men who had been casually interested in her suddenly treated her like she was infected.

the whole essay made me feel nauseous.

true to form, her essay framed the aftermath reactions as a valuable relationship litmus test. she severed ties with some friends and drew closer to others.

i can't help feeling like i failed the litmus test.

by picking up that paper and by making assumptions before i'd even started reading. i betrayed her and stole something that belonged to her.",11
"i used to throw out food so my mom had to cook again. when i was a kid i used to live alone with my mother, she always cooked more than necessary at lunch so she don't need to cook again for dinner. food usually was enough even for the next day lunch. i hated this, in my mind, there was no need for that. she was just lazy. i threw out the food so she had to cook a new one, this last for a month or so, obviously she realized what i was doing but never said a word, she just took the ""hint"" and cooked less.looking back, she was so fucking busy. single mother having to take care of a child and work at the same time. honestly, this is not something i cared that much until last week when she died, everything came back. all the shit i've done in the past that made our life difficult.",11
"i stopped attending a class, lied about turning in a final and still passed.. i was reading through a few posts on this sub and found one that reminded me about a class i took in college.

&#x200b;

back in my junior year of college i took a class with a professor that i really did not like. he was so disorganized, absent minded and really didn't teach anything. the kind of professor that tells you to watch youtube videos instead of actually teaching you the subject. it took him weeks to grade anything and i don't even think he read them. it seemed like he was just coasting until retirement. 

anyway, i flew out to see my grandma one week for her 90th birthday. i missed a few classes and missed a few youtube lessons. well the following week my grandma passed so i flew back out for her funeral in turn missing a few more classes. i was really far behind and really had no clue what we were working on, flunked the midterm and missed a big project. at this point i just gave up and reserved myself to failure and retake it in the summer. didn't show up to any other classes. 

at the end of the semester he emailed me regarding the final project and final test. he congratulated me on a great job with the group project. really weird since i haven't been to class in months and was definitely not part of a group project. he was also wondering if i had turned in the final paper. i emailed him back and told him how happy i was that he enjoyed the project and i had definitely turned in my paper. 

well i don't know if he wanted to cover his tracks and pretend he didn't lose my test or whether he didn't give a shit but when i checked my final grades for the semester, i had passed with a high c.

"i stole a book from the library page by page, then glued the pieces together at home. i was about 10 and i was addicted to read encyclopedias. i could spend hours learning about all sorts of stuff, staring at the illustrations and photos, and of course, smelling the books. however, i could get my fix at my local library only as my parents could barely afford food for us, let alone buying fancy books. so, i became a regular guest at the kids/teenager section of the library.

one day i couldn't get there in time, so i only had about half an hour to spend before closing time. not just that, but they also had a brand new, 400 page encyclopedia waiting for me on the shelf. it was love on the first sight. i felt awful, because i knew that i couldn't do much reading in such a little time, and then there was this lovely smelling book with a montage of astronauts, cars and magnificent landscapes on the front cover just begging me to read it. sadly, books like those were not borrowable and time was ticking.

i thought about 'taking it', but it was just enormous and i wasn't. i wasn't a bad boy either, i told myself. but what if i just take a few pages? that surely won't hurt anyone, and noone will notice it missing. that's what i did. the book was binded in a way, that i could carefully rip about 5 pages out in one go. i wrapped the pages around my foot, slipped them in my socks, covered my socks with my pants and i just casually walked out. the first time i actually said 'thank you very much' with a big smile to the librarian and she gave me that awkward 'what the heck are you talking about?' look. my 10 years old mind quickly realised how stupid i was to say that and i, maybe even my parents could be in jail for this, so i just rushed out, sweating and with my heart jumping out of my chest.

originally i wanted to return the pages at the next visit to the library. but as i was sitting on my bed at home, reading about the wildlife in africa (the only content i got at the time), i came up with the masterplan of repeating the process until i get every page. and the plan was working! not just that, but i improved on the technique. i wrapped pages around my feet, around my arms (had to wear long sleeve for that) and also kept a stack on my back, tucked carefully in my pants. i could get about 20-25 pages in just one day. i remember walking slowly like a robot on my way out as i didn't want to crush the pages too much. i couldn't bend in any direction because the pages were holding my limbs tight.

after several visits to the library the encyclopedia began to visibly shrink. so i got some paper from the photocopy room and replaced the missing pages with blank ones. my last visit was the sketchiest, because i had to take the trophy somehow. by trophy i mean the hard cover with the astronauts on. there was no way to wrap it like i did with the pages and it was too big to hide it anywhere on me. but i was so close to victory, i couldn't let it go. i had the shiny cover in its full glory, in my hand. i put it under my t-shirt, on my back. hands in my pocket, trying to hold the cover with my elbows. i was scared to the bone that they will catch me and send me to jail. i checked my reflection in the window. i looked like a terrified lady gaga with fake shoulderpads. but i was also shameless by this time, i knew i was an awful person. it was nearly 5 o'clock and every librarygoer left, the librarians were doing their closing up routines so the front desk was abandoned. i just walked out without anyone noticing me.

i glued all the pages and the cover together at home. the book was nowhere near as majestic as before, but i loved it anyway. i have never ever stolen anything else in my life, and i am so sorry for this.",11

all if it just feels so...numb and empty.

so i grabbed my cat, gave him to my neighbor, told him ill be out for a few hours. went back to my unit, tied a noose right by the already set up hook near my window. took a plastic chair. slid my head inside the rope. 

and then a knock. 

it was my neighbor. it was just an hour in since i gave my cat over, he was knocking furiously and shouting that i had to get him back. i hid my setup and cleaned up, hurried towards the door. he had scratches all over his arms and a big ass scab right across the left side of his cheek. my cat apparently started acting up, crying super loudly and was scratching furiously at the door out of nowhere. i apologized and asked if he wanted help with his wounds but he declined. i went back in and decided to sleep it off. 

update:

the amount of support and love i've been receiving is honestly surprising and overwhelming and i thank every single one of you guys who made the effort to send me a message or comment their experiences and support, i promise that i'll reply to every single one. i had absolutely no intention for this post to boom, i really just wanted to get this off my chest and even now everything just feels like a blurry mess i'm not sure if i'm even actually making any sense at all. and to clear things up i'm unsure how my post history has any connection to the confession above. i live in a completely different time zone (the philippines) from the (im assuming) majority of the people on here and idk i just seriously don't have the energy to try and defend myself at this point. 

i do realize that i am actually quite privileged. but of course before pulling the ""i'm suffering way more than you, suck it up you ungrateful cunt"" card on me. do realize that every single person's hardships are valid and not all individuals are alike. we have different levels of emotional capacity/stability/whatever. i'm sorry life's been hard on you but that's not a free pass to invalidate someone elses experiences. what you know might only be what you see or what you've been shown on the surface.

i'd like the thank the redditor who gave this post a reddit gold, truly appreciated. and also, for fellow suicide survivors, thank you for sharing your stories, thoughts and insights.

i feel like i'm not expressing the gratitude that i feel as much as i think i should and i wish everything in my head were more concrete and i apologize. ",11

"i managed to convince an entire park that i'm deaf.. i was playing basketball at my local park by myself when a group  gentlemen walked up to me and began asking me for ""nics"" or if i had any ""nics"" (later found out it was short for nicotine or cigarettes) not knowing what that was and not wanting to bother asking what it was, i for whatever reason blurted out ""i'm deaf i can't hear you"" whilst talking like a deaf person and pointing at my ear. what can i say, i just didn't wanna talk to them. for the rest of my time there that day more people began showing up, and every time they stepped onto the court the gentlemen from earlier would inform them i was deaf and i wouldn't be able to hear them. i figured i'm already in this deep i my as well keep going. so for the rest of the day i was the deaf guy playing basketball, talking like a weirdo, and making bullshit hand signals pretending not to hear anyone. even took a few balls to the face because i ""couldn't hear"" them saying ""look out!"" 

i left the park that day thinking that was a one time thing and i wouldn't ever have to do it again. however i go to the park quite often and apparently so does everyone else from day one. and every time i'm there they tell a new group of people and the cycle repeats itself. and i guess with my bullshit sign language i've sold it quite well because to some of the park staff, regular basketball players, and a few miscellaneous individuals think i'm just that deaf guy that goes to the park. even though my hearing is fine. 

i know it's only a matter of time until someone calls out my fake voice, bullshit sign language, or i slip up. but until then i'm kinda just stuck being this deaf dude because i'm too embarrassed to tell the truth at this point. 

update: i've continued going to the park every day, a few of the guys that i have become friends with and that have been very respectful of my disability asked if we could exchange numbers just to hang out some time. so far we've hung out 3 times. went to couple of baseball games and out to eat. and one even invited me to his wedding in january. i also no longer fear running into another deaf person as they may give me away. this is because in order to keep this up i'm proud to say i've extensively expanded my asl knowledge, and can string full real sentences that are no longer made up gestures. so i don't really know how much longer i'll do this, maybe even forever. perhaps this friend group will always know me as the deaf guy that goes to the park every day. and although i feel like an asshole for lying to people who i truly consider friends for so long, i think i'll embrace the good that came of all this and keep on signing.

"i called cps on my daughter and she is facing losing custody of her baby.. for context, my daughter is 15 years old. she has been living in my house with her 2 month old son since he was born, and i recently reported her to child services. she has a case opened and the case manager is on the verge of recommending removal (several factors at play). when she first told me she was pregnant i told her she either got an abortion, gave the baby up for adoption, or she could have the baby but i would give her nothing but what i am legally required to. she had only recently started high school, and i will be the first to admit i took the news *exceptionally* hard. i was scared out of my mind for her. my wife had always kept things open and told me she'd taken her to our local health department to talk about birth control (our daughter opted out and her doctor was in support) so we got her a large bag of condoms in the event she were to choose to become sexually active. she was prepared, she had the knowledge, she refused the birth control and ended up pregnant. honestly, we couldn't even afford to support her *and* the baby if we wanted to. 

my wife hasn't worked since 2011 and her disability hardly makes a dent in our expenses. we finally had to downsize our home and sell my wife's car just a few months before my daughter announced her pregnancy. i was working hours that just weren't sustainable and my wife needed me to help her at home. about 5 months into the pregnancy (my daughter insisted on raising the baby) her boyfriend moved away to live with family in another state and didn't tell her. she found out when the relatives made a post on social media about how excited they were he was there and then she was slowly blocked by the rest of the family. she hasn't heard from him since, he has never met his son and the family has never reached out.

 i told my daughter when she refused to abort that i would in no uncertain terms support her child, that i would love and treat them like a grandparent is expected to but i would not be financially responsible for it's care or keeping and if she could not find a way to provide, i would call the appropriate authorities to intervene. she dropped out but only got a part time job, was unmotivated to get her ged or diploma through adult ed (i actually offered to pay for her class fee and test fees) and expected that my wife would take care of the baby while she was at work. she would often forget and miss a feed, refused to pump milk regularly and got a major breast infection, would often delay changing to save money on diapers, it was not a good situation. my wife and i of course were there behind her and have been using formula and making sure he was getting nutrients, but my daughter was not nurturing this child in any competent manner and while not malicious, was often neglectful of the baby. it wasn't easy to make the call, but it was necessary and something i had long prepared to do. my daughter hates me, my wife is empathetic but has stood by my decision from the start, and i am both uncertain and at peace with my choices. part of me feels like i did the best i could for everyone involved and part of me knows i betrayed my daughter on a horrible way and part of me knows that this baby deserves better than what she ( and really *we*) could provide. 

edit: i did not realize that this would blow up over night. i would like to clarify a few things, though. i did not ever allow that baby to suffer. i did say my wife and i were going behind her with formula to make sure he was gaining his weight back, i didn't think i'd have to also clarify that we did indeed supply more diapers when we realized what she was doing. also, we have not neglected our daughter nor have we treated her to such cold indignities like neglecting her medical care. we did get her infection treated promptly, she had prenatal and postnatal care. contrary to what most people believe, i am not doing this out of anger. i am sad for my daughter and deeply disappointed that this is what life has come to but we cannot afford to raise her and a baby. i made this incredibly clear to her, and told her the consequences of her inability to provide once the baby got here would be child service involvement. we have not allowed either our daughter or her baby to wallow in filth or suffer, but we will not continue to provide the care for her infant, and so i had to call the only people i knew who would help. i won't pretend that i have made all the best choices or that i am perfect, but i am not heartless or abusive.

"i choked out an 8th grader 13 years ago. some background info needed. i come from a mixed race muslim family and grew up in a small post-9/11 midwestern town so there was a lot of bullying towards me and my siblings.

durring a school football game my younger brother was watching, one of the guys that bullied us, lets call him chad (who was in the same grade as me), threw a water bottle at my lil bros face. my brother (a 7th grader) had to walk home with a swollen eye and my mom had to put ice on it to get the swelling to go down. he wouldn't tell her who did it but he told me. this fliped a switch in my head.

my brother was a bullied a lot more than me on account he was younger, slightly effeminate and had dark skin like our father. meanwhile i was a year older, tall for my age and white like my mom so i didn't have it close as bad as him.

anyway. chad would leave school out one of the back exits to save time on his walk home. i knew nobody else left that way so when school got out the next monday i followed him. i ran after him and started chocking him from behind like i had seen in action movies. maybe it was because of the adrenalin but i started screaming all kinds of crap at him. the cliche ""dont mess with my family"" stuff. 

i left him unconscious behind the school and went home. this was the first and last time i used violence against someone. i never told anyone and neither did he so i wasn't punished for this. 

chad turned up to school the next day and everything was back to normal. the only thing that changed was that chad and his friends stopped harassing me and my bro.

to this day i still think he had it coming.

edit: if i'm being honest while i was choking chad and screaming at him i was also balling my eyes out. yea...fighting didn't suit me

edit 2: i was the same age as the other kid. sorry i didnt mean to make the title of this post so confusing",11
"i mercilessly bullied 5 people in high school. 3/5 of them killed themselves.. i am in my 40s now, and i don't deserve the life i have. i stepped on the backs of my classmates to make myself feel better about myself. i was bullied harshly in school, and had the shit beat out of me on a daily basis until i hit puberty. then i suddenly grew into a monster. i towered over everybody at school. i also channeled my anger into working out, and became even bigger. i was a huge, ogre of a person. i hated everybody. i had so much angst built up from my own bullying. my former bullies, being the manipulative cowards that they were (i see this in retrospect, but didn't see it at the time), befriended me. and we pretty much held a reign of terror over the school. i fed on the newfound respect from my former enemies. 

&#x200b;

we preyed on the weak. there were about 5 nerds that i personally tormented harshly. i joined facebook a couple months ago to see what became of them. i had hopes that they were able to live happy lives despite my awful treatment of them. one i knew died suspiciously in high school, but it turns out it was a suicide that was covered up. two more killed themselves right after high school graduation. the 4th lives alone in a trailer and appears to be crazy. the 5th person actually turned their life around and married the head cheerleader several years after graduation. so at least there's that.

&#x200b;

i wish i could apologize to the remaining two, but it would be so trite and meaningless. plus, it would probably re-traumatize them, having to see me again, or having to think about those events again.

&#x200b;

i suck, i'm sorry, and sometimes i feel like i should off myself too. you know, to balance the scales of life. i have been tormented my entire adult life for being the bully that i was, when i really should have been an advocate for the bullied instead. i mean, i already knew how it felt! instead of sticking up for people and beating the bullies asses, i, like a bitch, joined them. i can never forgive myself for that.

"when i was a kid, i tried to poison my entire family.. i'm the middle child and one day i just got fed up because i felt like nobody would take my side. my parents favored my siblings most of the time so i took the little black bottle at the back of the cupboard (which i thought was poison because it was small and black. i know, i'm stupid.) and fucking poured it all over the mushroom soup for dinner. i was smirking all throughout dinner waiting for them to start choking. turns out it was just vanilla extract.",11
"ejaculated on my grandmother's face.. one night when i was 13/14 my grandmother had come to visit us. she slept in my bed and i slept on the couch. at this point in my life, pretty much every night i would wait for everyone to go to sleep and then i would jack off. even though i was on the couch, i still decided to do it. for some reason, in my horned-up state, i got really turned on by the idea of ejaculating on my grandmother's face. so, without really thinking, i went into my room and while she was still asleep i quietly jacked off next to her and then finished on her cheek/neck area. 

after i finished i left as quickly and quietly as i could and went back to the lougeroom. i have no idea if she knows what i did. this happened a decade ago and i still hate myself every time i think about it. i don't know what i was thinking.

"my family doesn't know i'm graduating this year. the title says it all. when i asked around about adult education, and asked my parents opinion, they said it's a waste of time and money. they can be very... judgmental. they have no education and 'they turned out fine', that kind of thinking. i was very upset, but i really wanted to study psychology and help people. so i started a study without anyone knowing. in my country education is very affordable, so i didn't have financial problems. i failed a lot, and it wasn't easy, but after 7 long years i can finally say that i'm graduating. but i can't say it. not yet. i'll tell them when i'm actually working, so i have solid proof it wasn't a waste. it's very hard, and i know they'll be upset, but i really don't need to be dragged down now i'm almost there. i see them every week, and i have lied to their faces for 7 years straight, another few months won't make it worse. i need to tell someone though, so here i am. i'm not completely sure if this belongs here, but i don't know where else to put it


edit: thanks for all the support! it feels amazing to finally share this. i'm going to try and clear a few things up. i'm actually a 34 year old woman. i'm planning on starting my own independent practice, and have already modified part of my house to function as such, so i can start right away in august. i will update when i told them, probably the end of august, possibly september ",11
"i did heroin for two years when i was 17-18 and not a soul knew except for my dealer.. i had a very strange introduction to heroin. i got sort of tricked into it. i had snorted pills before, and the person told me it was an opiate when we did it at a party. this was in 2002, before a lot of pills and such were laced. this party was a sketchy party, i knew almost nobody there at all, it was mostly older people from new york. except when i did it, it was like 100 times stronger than any opiate i had ever tried before. it felt mindbogglingly amazing. i obviously wish i never did it. i was super drunk at the time and was basically down to try anything. 

i found out it was heroin while i was on it because the guys friend was yelling at him for basically lying to me and saying it was just an opiate, but at the time i didn't give a single shit. i was in blissful heaven, just laying down on that couch. 

i was a popular girl at my high school. not like the mean popular ones from heathers, i was more like the main girl from clueless. i did drugs and partied but i got good grades and presented myself as the preppy good girl to all the adults around me. i was very well liked by people, and was friendly to people. i threw parties which everyone liked. i was involved in clubs and sports teams. even to *me*, it was just weird that someone *like me* would ever try something like heroin. 

but i was hooked, right away. i contacted this guy micah who had dropped out of our school, i knew he sold. he had no friends in the school, he barely even spoke english. i told him i was getting it for a friend who had a horrible disease where they could barely walk, good excuse right? anyways, i did the same amount as before. very, very small amounts. 

at first i tried to keep it down to once a week. i knew how bad it was. my parents were good, normal successful parents and they would murder me if they ever found out. but i got obsessed with how good it felt. addictive doesn't even begin to describe it. nothing felt even close to the feeling that even a small, small bump of heroin gave me. 

over time i did it more often, but the same amounts. i think it gradually got worse and worse over the span of like 8 months. i was relatively good at keeping myself from becoming a full on addict. for one, my dealer knew i was the one using at this point, and he felt really bad about me. he wasn't a real heroin dealer, he was a user who was selling me some. and eventually, he cut me off. 

for a bit i struggled. i wasn't able to get h and i was so desperate for it that it made me depressed, and i think my anguish in relation to my addiction became more obvious to those around me. my parents chopped it up to me being depressed or anxious, my friends basically thought the same. i did something incredibly risky to find a dealer, i went through someone at our school and said my friend was looking for a dealer. its possible that the person i contacted could have told everyone and my whole secret would have been blown wide open, but they didn't. 

and so i found this new dealer, and he was sketchier than micah, but had better stuff. i went back to snorting after my month or so long break where i had no access. i paid for it just mostly through my job. it didn't take long for my tolerance to go back. i entered my senior year of high school as a dope addict, but found it easy to maintain my image as the cool popular girl. nobody, and i really mean nobody except my dealer, knew. 

eventually, i knew i was heading to college at the end of the year. i knew i couldn't go on like this at all. sometime after my 18th birthday, i went sober. part of it? for my 18th birthday, while all my friends wanted to party and my parents wanted to take me out to a nice dinner, i faked being sick so i could stay in my room and do h all day. it was all i wanted. that was kind of a wake up call for me to get sober before this got worse. and i went back on it a week later, and then 5 days after that i went sober again. during this time, i basically was just in my room or in the park most of my days. i skipped a ton of school. my parents had no idea what was wrong with me. 

eventually, after trial and error, i actually managed to be sober for a while. like 5 months. then i took 2 of my moms pain meds and got high from that, and was very close to going back to my dealer but decided against it. 

i went to college sober, and there was not even the opportunity to get heroin at the college. my urges went down, and eventually i just stopped thinking about it as much. i never tried any opiates, ever, after that. 

i also never told anyone about my addiction to heroin. ever. not even my current husband. never my parents. 

its just so weird to think about honestly. i was so, so not the stereotype of what a heroin addict was, and yet i was one. ",11
"i just gave a suburban mom the middle finger and it felt so empowering. light i'm a 16 year old boy i live in the suburbs. tonight we have a big parade in the downtown of our city, so tons of cars are driving there and back. i dropped off my parents so they could drink, and had to take the neighborhood route back home since all the main streets were packed. i went 20 on the neighborhood roads since there were people and parked cars everywhere. i noticed a white minivan was riding my ass and i was a little annoyed but not angry yet. then we got to the stoplight, and they tried to cross the double yellow lines just to be ahead of me in the left turn lane, but i sped ahead because i was not having that shit. so we were both waiting to go left and i had the longest yellow arrow of my life. also everyone was going where we came from so there was not a single gap i could have went left on. but mrs. everythinghastobeperfectformebecausemyhusbandisrich honked 3 times and kept raising her hand and acting like i'm an idiot for not risking my fucking life to make a left turn. 

so as soon as i got that green arrow, i drove right next to her and mouthed a glorious ""fuck you bitch"", complete with a middle finger. the look on her face was priceless. she looked so offended and shocked that i would use vulgar language in her little christian suburb.

i usually try to be civil and not get on the bad side of people with more authority than me, but damn that was l i b e r a t i n g. i'm so sick of rich ass moms doing whatever they want without any consequences, so to upset her like that just felt great.",11

"i steal my housemate's food and nobody ever suspects me because they think i am vegan. i was vegan when we started living together but i gave up since then and i started stealing anything i can get my hands on. they never suspect me because they think i wouldn't eat those items. 
never been even close to being caught.  
i always make sure to cook when nobody is home or to hide packaging and wrappers in my trash. 
it's more about the fact that i can do it without consequences that makes me do it. nobody complained about missing food items more that a couple of times so i dont think i am that much of a nuisance.







edit: just wanted to clarify a few things. 
i dont lie about being vegan. other people in my life know i am not a vegan anymore and i dont lie or hide this fact from anyone. the people i live with are never really around to socialise so they never had the chance to find out about it. 
also if they ever said something about being upset or really in a bad situation because of my actions i would definetly stop. my reasoning is that i dont take a lot or that what i take was going to go to waste anyway( food constantly goes bad in the fridge).
this is no way me trying to get away from the fact that what i'm doing is wrong.  i know i souldnt be doing it but it's a bit of an addiction.",11

i feel so bad. i know that bad parenting played a role in this, too. you never know how much that shit impacts you until you're older. my mom taught us that our looks were our only worth. but my sister ended up proving her massively wrong by pursuing a master's degree and being driven to be a smart, high-functioning human. she's making very good money in sf now. and to top it off, she is very beautiful. she was never ugly.",11
"i've never been to my math class sober. i passed my last year of highschool with 11 points in math (i live in germany, we have grades from 1 to 15, 15 being the best). i could never stand math, it bored the ever loving fuck out of me. so for my last year i decided i'm not gonna bother anymore. i got drunk before every lesson because that's what made them at least interesting enough to deal with. i talk a lot when i'm drunk, normally i'm very shy and don't really say stuff in lessons espially when it's a subject i'm not good at. so i got good grades just for that - talking. i'm the kind of drunk that seems pretty sober to a certain point. i never crossed that line. no one noticed i turned up drunk to every math lesson that year.

that being said, this wasn't a good thing. don't do this just because it turned out ok for me.  also don't drink out of boredom just because i did. i'm putting this on a cofession side because this is not something to be proud of!

edit: a lof people are commenting that people must have noticed. i know for a fact that no one noticed because i had some really good friends in that class. when they found out about this, they told me i'm crazy and that i should stop immediately. these friends knew me very well. if they couldn't even tell i was drunk, no one else would. i also used very strong cologne around that time so, no, you couldn't smell it. when they told me to stop this (they cared a lot about me, still do, if they had known earlier they definitely would have told me to stop) i had already stopped. i just did this for my math class. i'm not an alcohol (anymore). i only drink on special occasions. i never drink to 'get through' stuff anymore. i'm fine now. please stop commenting that i should get help. don't worry about me.",11

my parents refuse to get better internet using bullshit excuses like ""its too expensive""""you will be on it all the time"" and my favourite ""our neighbours complained about the guy that installed the new cables."" it's bullshit because we are on an old plan and its cheaper to switch i am pretty active and  there is no proof bad installation guy exists.

"i ""accidentally"" found out my employer was closing his business so i waited out on purpose to get a redundancy.. long story. bear with me.

i worked 10 years in my previous job as an e-commerce and store manager. i loved my job. i loved my staff. i loved the clients. 

i did not love my boss. he was the most unprofessional and mean person i ever met. he was rude and ignorant to everybody and always thought he was right no matter what evidence anybody had to support the other.

i have posted enough about him in previous threads. but i hated him. after years of his emotional bullying and gaslighting i was broken down. i went into a depression utterly lost and feeling worthless. i started applying for better jobs. so did my staff. they were open with me. we knew he was the problem.

one day one of my staff called me out of the blue. did i know anything about a redundancy? i hadn't a clue what they were talking about. you see, we had a 'shop' ipod attached to our speaker system. however it was synced with my employers personal iphone. any calls, any whatsapp's and any texts went through his ipod aswell. a mild inconvenience to us if we were using spotify but whatever. 

a text notification popped up that was from my employers accountant. the message read ""i'm not to sure in regards to statutory redundancy..."" with the rest of the text cut off that my staff saw as they were changing the music on the ipod. my employer had folded a concession in a department store the year previous, perhaps he was following up with that? i really hadn't a clue but this seemed plausible. it would be typical of him to leave important redundancy issues this late as he was an asshat. my staff were appeased, panic over. nothing to do with us. right?

except now i was curious. i knew i couldn't look into previous texts on the ipod unless the messages had already been read by my employer. i waited until i was cashing up alone one evening a few days later and went to the ipod.

there was a thread of messages from my employer to his accountant about putting the business into liquidation. i was shocked. i felt sick reading somebody else's messages but i could not know.

was he talking about the previous location? there was no other details attached other than looking into redundancy and claiming liquidation. it didn't specify any staff or store location or time periods. i didn't share this information with my staff.

but then i started looking into my employers behaviour. he was skittish, stopped showing up to work and was acting more odd than usual.

i held out. i turned down a job and cut out a holiday i had planned to take. sure enough, 3 weeks later i got an email about a staff meeting in regards to ""financial readjustment"" of the company. i knew the final bell had tolled.

i still want my oscar for my incredible performance of hearing this ""news"" for the first time.

i got my redundancy. 4 months late. a healthy sum and a welcome one because i'm saving for a house.

of course he fought me on the amount and tried to short me almost €2000 but when i told his accountant i was going to bring him to the claims court  all of a sudden my calculations were correct!

so yeah. that's my little confession. and i'm not sorry. fuck you *employers name*, you're a prick  and what goes around comes around.

edit; for all us readers. severance is the same idea as redundancy. redundancy is an instance where your job is no longer available or the business closes. you get paid either by your employer or through a subsidised government redundancy scheme. the later has a few qualifying factors.",11
"i let my son believe he's a dinosaur because it helps him sleep better. my 2.5 year old thinks he's a dinosaur. like...24/7 acts like a dino. it started at about a year old when i made him a dinosaur hoodie for halloween. he started pretending a lot and ""roaring"" at everyone. then in transitioning from crib to bed he picked out dinosaur sheets and it's all dinosaurs all the time from then on. 

he roars constantly and at total strangers. he has a whole dinosaur ""family"" of toys that follows him everywhere. he walks like a dino and tell me every morning what new species he is and gets really upset when i forget today's type. at first i thought it was cute. then after a week i got concerned. now after a couple months i've fully embraced it. 

with an active two year old, it's sometimes hard to get him to calm down and go to bed. but since the dinosaur ""awakening"" he's gone to bed flawlessly so long as i pretend he is a ""longneck"" traveling to the great valley (land before time reference for those that done know). i spin this big story and he closes his eyes and gets so excited. it's his favorite thing in the world. my favorite thing in the world is hearing a quiet, whispered ""rawr"" in response to my ""goodnight, i love you."" 

he'll probably be upset one day when he discovers i've used his overactive imagination to trick him into sleeping, eating broccoli, walking faster on our hikes, etc. on the other hand, i have two months worth of super cute videos of him ""speaking"" dinosaur, so i think i'm okay with it. :)  🦖 🦕 ",11
"i always bullshit my way through school (and most recently college). i've always hated reading long texts when i'm not interested on the topic. so, when i was in high school and the teachers gave an assignment related to reading (like in english class, when we had to read macbeth, of mice and men, etc). i would just read chapter summaries and do the respective essays and tests (my lowest grade was like a b). and so on. or this other time when we were watching a documentary for social studies class and the teacher told us that we had to write the key ideas in a piece of paper. i remember that it was boring, so i was just on my phone and every once in a while i would write some ideas that i heard. i didn't write more than ten, and when my teacher read it he said ""this is one of the best summaries i've read"". then, someone told me that this would not work in college when you really had to study. nope, still works. i'm taking a communication class where we have to read a long and boring textbook and write a one page summary in our own words. for this, i just google the title of every chapter and get some ideas from different websites and write my summary. so far, i've earned a's in these summaries, and another a in the first exam. sometimes i regret it because i know i'm not really learning anything, but i believe studying shouldn't be the only thing you care for in life, so i'm not going to stress out about the classes i don't like (and that are not required for my degree) and i'm going to continue doing this for as long as i can.

"i got drunk at work , stole cheesecake and ended up passed out in the dressing room. so this happened a few years back.  i worked for a high end clothing store as a stock clerk/order pull.  one week they asked me if i would be willing to work the night shift from 8pm to 4am.  these were very unusual hours and it was me and two other coworkers required to stay.  i had another job lined up at the time so my commitment for the current one was not very strong to begin with.

i decided i wanted to make my night a little more interesting so before i work i stopped and bought a bottle of whiskey knowing that my boss would not be working and it would be very relaxed.  i ended up drinking a lot more than i should have.  i'm great at handling my alcohol and my friends will tell me that i dont seem even slightly drunk, when on the inside i know exactly how drunk i am.  so i pounded a bottle of whiskey in my car right before going in.  about an hour and a half into my shift, i was stumbling and knocking stuff over, luckily none of my coworkers saw this.   i started getting hungry and i knew that on the 3rd floor there was a little bakery/restaurant that the store owns.  i'm not sure why they dont lock the bakery up but i thought it would be a good idea to go check it out.  i ended up hoping over the counter and getting into all of their cheesecakes.  i had about 4 slices of 4 different types of cheesecake, and i also helped myself to some sprite.  i was so happy but i started to feel really tired after, i ended up going into one of the dressing rooms and completely passed out on one of the benches inside.  i woke up about 2.5 hours later with my name blaring over the loud speaker.  i thought for sure someone had seen me and reported me.  i got to one of my coworkers and they were saying ""where were you?!? where did you go, we've been looking all over for you!!""  i told them i got sick and i was puking in the bathroom and needed to go home.  no more questions were asked and i was sent home that night.  never ended up getting caught.",11

several years before he died, there was a night where my wife and i were lying in bed.  i honestly have no idea what i ate that day, but i had a case of particularly noxious gas.  i happened let a silent one go right as bubba jumped up on the foot of the bed.  he walked up to the head of the bed, every step he took helped push the fumes out towards the top of the covers.  he reached the pillows and decided to curl up right between my wife and i, with his butt conveniently pointed towards her.  it was then that the fumes got out and my wife instinctively blamed bubba.  she grabbed him off the bed, ejected him from the room, and closed the door.  as she spent the next couple minutes complaining about the cat, i couldn't say anything.  it was all i could do to keep from laughing about the cat getting the blame.

2 years ago bubba died of a heart attack.  he was walking across the family room and fell over dead instantly.  i will always remember you, and i will never forget the time you took one for the team.

so when i was first there i met this man we'll call 'sev'. he was very bi-polar but was a loving dude at heart who was also battling addiction and depression. we would spend hours a day talking and i watched him progress from having nothing to almost owning his own apartment within a few months. i was so proud of the dude and was excited for his new life he created for himself. he had a new job, new clothes, a bike and a cell phone, little things he just didn't have while living on the street. seeing that kind of progress always gave me hope for myself.

so one day he came in limping, pale and just like he was on the brink of death. me and the other residents at the shelter asked him about it and he seemed to just blow us off, not admitting anything to anyone. the other guards said he relapsed and was just drunk. being an alcoholic myself i didn't buy it. it got progressively worse and worse as the days went on. 

one day he didn't come home during his curfew. everyone was looking for him, calling his phone, checking his regular hang-out places. nobody had seen him. i was working the night shift and a police officer came buy and dropped him off. he couldn't even hold himself up. the smell coming off his body was a mixture of just about every bodily fluid you can excrete. i had to carry him to his room or else he would he wouldn't have moved. apparently they found him in a ditch by a lake or something... 

the next few days were spent in his room with other homeless people doing what little they could to help. i knew this wasn't a drinking binge. i asked if i could call the ambulance and my bosses said there was nothing i was allowed to do if i wanted to keep my job.

i guess he drank antifreeze a few days before and it takes a week to fully die. he went in probably the most painful way you can go. it still haunts me. i know there was nothing i could do but still. dude deserved to live. nobody knows who he is. he just disappeared. but i remember.

"gave mince beef to a vegetarian. in year 8 food tech we had to make a unique pasta dish.
i decided to do bare minimum and make a vegetarian dish.
literally just spag bol with quorn. homemade sauce.
so we make the meals and cook them and then we have tasting. i put mine in the vegetarian section. 
everyone is trying it and enjoying it, one girl who is an actual vegetarian has seconds because 'it's delicious'

feeling dead proud of my self.
go home and tell my dad... awkward silence. he forgot to get quorn and just put minced beef in a pyrex dish for me.

tl;dr - gave a vegetarian minced beef thinking it was quorn and they loved it.

edit: in work so not been able to respond.
thought i'd clarify a few points

1. i was a dumb 12 year old who'd never cooked before also day dreamed quite a bit didn't pay attention to what was in the pan

2. genuinely unintentional, also didn't know this girl was a vegetarian until she mentioned it later

3. no idea if it was morales or other reasons to being a vegetarian.

ha also quite easy to see who are meat eaters on this thread.",11
"i regret coming out especially to my best friends..  i came out as bisexual to most people when i was 18. when i turned 19 i started dating a wonderful girl who i considered marrying. i was head over heels in love and she wanted me to tell my family. i was scared. they are conservative and my dad was even a pastor for a while. i loved her enough that i did. i told everyone in my life. i was blocked by most of my extended family and didn't talk to my mom while i was dating her. my dad was uncomfortable. he pretended he didn't care because his wife is okay with that but he totally did. 

awhile passed and i realized it was my first love and i wanted to figure myself out before settling down. i dated around for a few years and didn't favor either gender. i dated a couple girls and a couple guys. currently i'm with  a wonderful man who i adore. we have been together 5 years and are getting married in october. 

everyone thinks i went through a phase. my mom always tells me that she's glad i snapped out of it. a lot of my friends, some in the lgbt community, make jokes about my 'gay phase.' they knew i would end up with a man all along because bisexuality isn't real.  others are angry i'm with a man because i'm suffocating my lesbian self. 

some ask if i'll ever get a girlfriend after marriage  because it's not cheating, right?? one of my best friends gets drunk and tries to kiss me when she's drunk because she's bi too! plus our partners would love to watch it! 

it makes me so angry and i wish i had never told anyone.  keeping it hidden would be better than this fake support and people believing my sexuality was a phase. ",11
"i fed my boyfriend and his friends dog food. no regrets

i was in high school, it was the late 80s. i was emancipated already, so i had my own apartment. i also had pay channels because the landlord had a package deal that included my tv. 

a guy started really hitting on me, whom i really rather liked. it didn't dawn on me that he had only started doing so *after* i got my own apartment (which meant time away from his restrictive home environment for him). 

well, he started spending time at my house, then he started bringing his friends to watch my pay channels with him and ignoring me... the first time they ate my food, i had cooked myself some crockpot chili for the entire week. it was literally all my meals for the week, to be divvied up into the freezer and eaten as needed. i asked nicely for them not to do it again and explained clearly that it was all my food for the week.

they did it again the next weekend when i made myself a lasagna.... and this time i yelled at them. my erstwhile 'boyfriend' then slapped me and told me to knock it off (i was interrupting their show, you know). i was rather outraged that not one guy, not *one* so much as batted an eye about it.

instead of breaking up with him immediately, though, i hatched a plot... i bought two cans of alpo wet dog food and a bag of egg noodles. i made ""goulash"" with it in the crockpot and let them eat it. 

after that, i brought the landlord's dog up. i carefully let him lick each and every bowl (because, of course, they didn't wash their dishes after they stole my food, either). i placed them into the cabinet as nonchalantly as i could, pretending this was how i always did dishes.

i then answered their question about ""what was the recipe"" of my ""delicious"" food.... and placed the two open cans of alpo on the table.

needless to say, they never came back. i took great relish in spreading it around school that they not only ate literal dog food--but they loved it enough to want the recipe.

edit: tl;dr my ""boyfriend"" and his buddies ate my food twice. when i objected, he slapped me. so i fed them dog food.",11
"i once pickpocketed a friend of a friend and consoled her afterwards because she was sad her wallet was stolen. first of all: i know i was a complete asshole and wouldn't even consider it now.

we were at a sort of carnival party where everybody dresses up etc. my girlfriend at the time was with a group of friends she didn't know too well and didn't like either. i was in a group of wrong friends and did wrong things to impress them, like stealing/pickpocketing.

at the party i was on a roll and decided to make it a little more exciting (cringe when i think about it now) so i decided to pickpocket the 'friend' of my girlfriend. it worked out and my 'friends' were proud of me which i would have done a lot for in that period.. the haul wasn't even that great but that wasn't even the motivation for me at the time. 

later when we went home we waited on the train and the 'friend' of my girlfriend was crying because she lost her wallet. which i stole. her friends were all feeling bad for her, except my girlfriend, and i decided with my dickheadish head to try and console her. it worked for as far as i remember, at least she stopped crying. my girlfriend knew about it and she only laughed about it, eventually we broke up which was one of the last strings between me and my 'evil' friends.

i was a dick and learned from it, but for me it was still the most dumb/mean thing i ever did even tho i got away with it..",11
"i vengefully ejaculated on my ex-girlfriend's art project. i'm always very reserved; the opposite of an impulsive person. this was an exception.

some backstory: this all happened a few years back, in college. she was my only serious relationship, which lasted about a year. wicked smart woman in most ways, but emotionally? total idiot. we had that in common. she was going abroad for a semester and decided that she wanted us to split up  (so that she could focus on her studies) with the intention to get back together after she returned to the states. we were both pretty torn up by the decision but admitted it was probably for the best. i tried to support her by keeping my distance, but confusingly, she reversed her that stance very quickly and started leaning on me (as an ex in a different country) for all her emotional support. it was pretty rough. i did what i could but obviously it wasn't enough. then, i hit the low point for my own loneliness and reached out. she immediately flipped the switch and acted uncomfortable that now i was the vulnerable one. she texted me at the end of summer that she no longer wanted to get back together, but tepidly left the door open to change her mind.

when the new semester started, my ex continued to give off mixed messages. right away she wanted to be best friends, but i really wasn't in the right head space for that. as you might imagine, i still had some hangups about how i was treated and didn't want to jump into a deep platonic friendship without some sort of reconciliation. about two months later, she invited me to a dinner party. thinking this would be a good avenue to make amends,  i bit the bullet and attended. it was immediately awkward. we barely even made eye contact at the party...but she was very chatty with some other boy i'd never seen before. turns out that in addition to her bitter ex-boyfriend, she also invited the guy she was currently sleeping with to the same party. whoops. this already felt like a slap in the face for me, but just as the party was winding down, she couldn't even wait until i'd left the room before grabbing the other boy's hand and walking up to her bedroom with him.

it sounds hackneyed, but i never truly understood what people meant by ""heartbreak"" until this moment. the entire center of my body felt like it had run out of batteries and just shut down, sitting like a lump of cold metal in my rib-cage. once i had stumbled home, i swigged some suspiciously cheap vodka and contemplated carving my ex's initials into my arm with a pocket knife. i was badly out of sorts. in rare act of spontaneous judgement, i began gathering up all the little mementos and gifts she'd given me since we had first met. some of this shit was the most thoughtful, clever things you could hope for from a significant other, but i couldn't bare to look at them anymore. without digression, i tossed everything related to her in a garbage bag. i admitted all of this to her months later, in a rambling, mopey email. she was understandably distraught that i would do this. what i didn't tell her (or anyone, for obvious reasons) was this next part.

right next to my bed, i had taped up a painting she'd made in a class. it was a white-on-black, minimalist rendering of a nude woman. i was never aroused by it or anything...it was just a cute little art print that my ex had created and decided to gift me. i put it on my wall because it was hers, not because of what it looked like. but for whatever reason, whether because of the subject matter or the fact that it was hand-crafted by her, this print was the one and only object i would not let enter the trash unscathed. i tore it off the wall, then angrily jerked off into it (thinking of my ex the whole time, of course). it was the most wrathful masturbation i've experienced to this day. once i had finished, i looked down at what i had wrought. i was mostly disgusted. why did i even do this? but...something about the contrast of a white puddle on a black canvas, obscuring the image of the nameless woman painted there...well, it was oddly aesthetic, in a childish way. and fitting. this wasn't my intention, but in that moment, i felt like a bit of an artist. no way in hell this nasty thing was going back on the wall, though. i crumpled it up, tossed it in the bag, and walked an extra block to a faraway dumpster where no one would recognize me.

the whole thing was gross, stupid, immature, aimless, and did next to nothing in my goal of getting over the relationship. years later, i'm still single, and i still miss her. all the same, no artist could have created a better visual representation for my complicated feelings at the time. i may have defiled a piece of innocent art like a sad creep, but for a brief instant, i grieved as a heartbroken painter.

"i caused my school to hold an assembly on locking stall doors in the bathroom.. one time in elementary school i would go to the bathrooms and lock the stall doors then crawl under the doors and leave them locked and then i'd get water from the sinks and cup it in my hand then splash water under the doors so they'd then leave. this meant that anyone who wanted to use a stall had to crawl under the door and get all wet, and they couldnt tell if it was pee or just water. i did this for 7 weeks before the entire school held an assembly about it.

i still have no regrets.",11

"i almost died of alcohol poisoning and then lied about it. i almost died of alcohol poisoning last weekend. i was in a party with some friends. in barely 2 hours i drank a whole bottle of gin by myself. besides the alcohol i also consumed 2gr of weed and some ecstasy (unsure about the quantity.)

i wasn't feeling bad or unwell but suddenly i started feeling weird. not bad. just weird. i decided to leave the party just in case i got worse. i didn't tell anyone, i just left. 

while i was waiting for the bus to come i started to feel really bad. i couldn't even stand on my feet and everything seemed to spin around me. then i passed out.

things get a little dark up from this point because i really don't remember much. i remember looking up to the sky. throwing up. a crowd of people looking down on me. an ambulance coming. me being carried to the hospital. more throwing up. 

here is where the lies begin. as i was being taken to the hospital i realised what was happening. i knew that they would call my parents if i told them i am underage so i hid my id in my shoe. (i am 17, in my country the legal age of adulthood is 18.) luckily i look older. when asked about it, i gave them a fake name, fake adress, fake details about myself...when asked if there was someone they could call i told them that all my friends were as drunk as i was (which was probably true), 
that i was living alone and that no one could pick me up. i told them i had no money for a taxi and that i had to walk home.

the medics injected me with some adrenaline, vitamines and other drugs and just let me go. no question asked. 

when my friends asked about what happened to me, i told them i was just fucking with some girl i met. 

i actually feel horrible about what i did and i needed to talk about it, even if it's just on some random internet page.

edit: 

there's lots of people in the comments saying how mixing drugs is the most stupid thing one can do. i know that. when i took all that shit i thought it wouldn't be so bad. i regret it now. i should have been more careful.

some people have asked why i drink so much. the truth is, i've had depression. i am much better now, some people even say i'm 'cured' but still, i drink because it helps me forget about myself. for a night, it's like i'm a different person and all the problems and bad things in my life dissapear. still, i never drink more than a quarter or even half a bottle. drinking the entire bottle is new to me. i'm still trying to figure out how i lost control of myself. i never lose control. 

anyway, before this i thought i wanted to die but i never wanted to live as much as i wanted to live when i was lying on a hospital bed struggling to keep breathing. i'm looking forward to talk about this experience with my therapist. 

finally, thanks to everyone for worrying about me and for supporting me and for giving me advice about how to handle this situation and about how  to improve myself. i really mean this, thank you very much for your love and support.",11
"iv'e been pretending to be a college student for the past two years.. at 23 years old, i decided that i wanted to live the college experience because i had never had the opportunity to see what college was like. so i ""enrolled"" at the local university which has around 30,000 students and pretended to be a student there.  i joined various clubs, went to classes, and i even got involved with a fraternity for a short stint. i simply told everybody that i was a sophomore and that i took the majority of my classes online.  nobody ever questioned me either, i assume that people think i'm around 20 or 21.  


i took advantage of the various clubs that the school had to offer. i joined a film production club, an improv club, joined a rec sports team, got involved with a church and ran the sound board for them for a short stint, and i even got involved with a fraternity for a couple of months.   this was all without even going to school there, but i figured it was a great way to get involved and meet people around my age relatively (even though the majority of them are 3-5 years younger)  i also met many people, made some friends, and even got invited to parties.

i'll be 25 in the next couple of months and i'm starting to realize i probably won't be able to do this forever.  there will come a day when i start to look noticeably older than everybody else.  so i figure i may have another year or two before it's clear that i definitely look older than 21.",11
"at the age of 7, i tied up my neighbor of my age to a chair until she said she loved me. i was basically a piece of shit younger. and this just hit me today like a mf train. i feel so bad.

what happened is that i was with my neighbor home, both 7, and we used to kiss each other whenever we were in private. 

one time, she told me she loved somebody in her class. what i did was tie her to a chair, and told her that she couldn't get out after she said she loved me. this lasted for like 25 minutes at most, and after that i released her.

"i put fish tank water in her coffee maker. when i was in college, i had the worst roommate ever. no respect for privacy, noise, or my food in the fridge. what had really tipped the iceberg for me was the day she started yelling at me for the way our room smelled. told me i needed to be showering at least once a day. i wasn't the problem; it was her stupid microwave meals that made our place smell like shit.  

i didn't have enough balls back then to tell her to fuck off, so what did i do? the next time i had to clean out the water for my betta fish's tank, i dumped the semi-gross water into her fancy keurig coffee maker. she made coffee in that thing for the next week until i moved out. i have no regrets. and, if by some miracle, she's reading this: fuck you rikki!

tldr; college roommate pissed me off so i put dirty fish tank water in her coffee maker

edited to add: another reason my roommate pissed me off was because i had been gifted a can of pepper spray by one of my friends and ex roomie thought it would be a good idea to test it in our tiny 15''x12' dorm room

"i'm a 15 yo (male) drug addict. a little background. i live in a tri-city area where 3 of 3 city's have a drug problem and only 2 of 3 show up on the news for it (i live in the ""safer"" city).

 i think the main reason i'm addicted is curiosity and depression. the drugs i've tried are (in order of trying them); weed, alcohol, lsd, adderall, dxm, dph. if i'm not mistaken that means i've tried every type besides opiates and benzos (i'm stupid but not that stupid).

 i'm mainly addicted to dxm and dph bc of there easy access. every time i go to my grandparents house i go to their medicine cabinet and see what i can take. it's gotten to the point that it's all i think about.

 and the worst part is, i'm taking everybody down with me, for example one day i went over to my best friend of nearly 4 years to smoke weed and pick up some adderall he was about to move so we decided to get fucked up (he took 30mg and i took 45) it was great besides him having a small panic attack which ended quite quickly. however about a week (after he moved) later he texted me that he was in the hospital bc he took 90mg xr and didn't eat for 3 days turns out he got hella addicted, which is my fault.

 my other best friend of nearly 3 years doesn't do any drugs, and when i told her of my problem(s) i feel like a burden on her life and bc i'm another thing she has to worry about. when i told her about my problem i told her i was trying to sober up and i was. but my dad turned off my service (for other reasons) and i couldn't talk to her, or anyone. ended up relapsing within a week of ""becoming sober"". that was over two months ago and i still haven't talked to her. since then it got way worse, i started ordering dxm to my house and my dad caught me when i ordered over 10 grams of dxm, and gave me a super long talk about the ""addiction demon"" (which i have) but i didn't tell him bc i was to nervous. 

since it's summer break and i've had no service to text my normal guy i haven't had access to weed or lsd, but as soon as school starts back i will and i'm a little scared of how bad it gonna get

"i flooded a hotel washroom with my shit.. i was staying at this hotel during a family vacation and i ate a bad chicken wrap. my family went to go for a walk so i dipped and hauled ass to the bathroom in the lobby. the second i went in, i knew there was no holding back. i just released it all, thinking i was alone. it sounded like an elephant blowing its nose and echoed throughout the room. a voice next to me went, ""goddamn"" and another one laughed. it was humiliating. then, after my business, i went to flush the toilet, and that's when the mess (pun intended) all started. after i pressed the button, the water rose but kept rising. i painfully watched it creep to the top hoping it would stop, but it just kept going. i watched as a mixture of my shit and toilet water spilled over the edges, pouring onto the floor. the water kept going and pretty soon the people beside me were going, ""what the hell is that??!"" and were frantically panicking. at this point i knew that it would start flooding the room, so i had to make a dash for it. i ran out the stall. my cheeks burned as i dashed outside the lobby area, but not before seeing the ""out of order"" sign taped to the washroom stall door. to this day, no one knew it was me.

"my fiance & i tested his sister's supposed gluten allergy.. edit: she's been to the doctor for both celiac & gluten allergy/sensitivity tests. her results came back negative for both, but she says the doc is lying in order to run more tests.

edit 2: holy shit is my inbox blowing up!

edit 3: this was 2 years ago. his mother found out and gave us a severe tongue lashing, then told the sister and she screamed at us for an hour. we've not done it since, and will never do it again.

---------------

we were both so sick and tired of listening to his sister whine about gluten this, and gluten that. and she'll carry on about how everything had to be gluten-free to the point where she's taken over the family pantry.

mind, we both understand the seriousness of celiac disease. so the only reason we decided to test her was because is how she eats when it something she really wants.

one night she found out halfway through dinner that her dad forgotten about the gf breadcrumbs she'd bought, and had instead used the normal variety he's been cooking with as far back as he can remember. holy hell did she raise a stink! completely stopped eating her meal and sent the rest of the night bitching & moaning about stomach cramps and other assorted bathroom issues. this carried on into the next day where she lectured him about gluten allergies while still morning about bathroom problems.

now, when it's something she really wants, is a completely different story. she'll eat whatever it is and go about her day like a normal human being. not a peep about stomach pains or anything, sometimes she'll even have seconds or behind it to work for lunch the next day.

so here's where we expirimented with her. the recipe called for browning the hamburger then mixing in some flour to make a paste. i was going to skip it entirely to be nice, but my fiance said he wanted to test her response. so i made the recipe as listed but only he & i knew about it. everyone ate the dinner, rave reviews! they told me i could make that again any time! and wouldn't you know, not one peep from the sister. she even had it for lunch the next couple days and still not a word!",11
"my brother talked me into stealing $300 worth of game cards for him.. when i was 10 years old my big brother (14 at the time) was super into world of warcraft. he knew that i would do what he asked me to, so he came into my room and asked me if i could steal some game cards to satisfy his gaming life (game cards are small credit card sized plastic ""coupons"" you buy in order to play the game. they let you play for a month). he even said that if i do this for him, we could go into the toy store and steal some lego for me.

stupid me asked how many i had to steal ,,meh, just crab 10 and shove em in your backpack"". what i didn't know was that they were worth 200dkk a peice ($30). and what i didn't know either was that they were equipped with alarm ""chips"". so i walked out of the shop with my backpack full of gamecards worth 2000dkk ($300). the alarm goes off and i start running. i've never been so scared in my life. they must have thought it was a false alarm as they didn't seem to chase me.

in the time after this i threw up on a daily to weekly basis. my parents thought i was sick and took me to the doctor and they tried all kinds of things. i continued to stick my fingers in my throat and throw up in order to feel better even a year after it happened. i never really got over it. i'm 21 today and i have never told anyone.

"kid crying over a lego set he wasn't allowed to buy, so i bought it in front of him, for myself.. boys like lego, right?

sort of sounds weird that lots of the current kids who are in to star wars, are only in to it because of the lego sets of it they saw when they were younger.

i wasn't any different.

when i was four or five, i got one of those small $2 packs of some star wars character that's usually on the side of the checkout lanes with all the candy and gum. i didn't know what it was then, but there were blasters and i wanted it. i wasn't a spoiled child, i never asked for much. so my parents didn't really care, it was only $2.

i didn't know what i was getting in to.

by the time i was six, i had watched all the star wars films and cared too much about the clone wars show. ten years later, i'm still a star wars nerd and i'm currently surrounded by four giant posters and a bunch of memorabilia. 

let's go back again. when i was 8, i bought my second lego set. i actually knew what star wars was this time, so i wasn't going to get a set of some random unnamed jedi that died during order 66 fighting against one clone trooper. 

i just got some regular $10 one. not the mini packets, but not the giant cardboard sets either. 
i wasn't a very needy child, it was the second lego set i ever bought, the first one from two years earlier still in perfect condition to this day.

but there was this kid. this damn kid...

i knew what i wanted to get, but i noticed there was only one on the shelf. now i'm a nice person, i don't stand too close to strangers, i give him his space. so i decided, alright i'll just walk in and get it after the kid moves away.

that kid literally didn't move away.

his hands all over my box and the one i wanted. he started crying all over the place. smearing his hands all wet with tears on the box. he held it in his hand and ran all over the store with it. his face was bright red, damn, he wanted that thing. after his guardian said no for the millionth time, he put it back on the shelf.

it was time. run in quickly, grab it, pay for it, and walk out. so i ran in, grabbed it, paid for it, and walked out. but this isn't one of those small mall locations. this store was huge. the checkout counter was at the very back, so i had to walk for like a minute to get to the front.

since i was at the store with my family friend, i just sat there while he picked out some lego set meant for kids, like the bigger blocks kinda thing. 

star wars episode vi: return of the kid.

the kid comes back to the same location, dragging his mom. it's probably the first time the mom even walked there with him, she just kept saying no before.

the kid was so confused. the box which was there minutes ago, was suddenly gone. his mom thought that there was nothing there in the first place, she picked him up, and carried him out the store. the kid, still bawling his eyes out.

as the mom had him over her shoulder, the kid glanced at me as he was being carried out. he saw the set he wanted in my hand. keep in mind that this set is small, so i told the cashier no when he asked me if i wanted a bag. i mean i'll just put it in the bag of another store my parents are shopping in, no need for more plastic bags.

the kid sees it. he starts screaming and pointing and trying to get his mom's attention. the kid barely makes out the words telling his mom that i took what he wanted. now, she understands that i took what her son wanted. she comes up to me, with her kid staring down at me as i'm sitting on the ledge by the front of the store.

""thank you.""

edit: ""thank you"" as in an actual sincere thank you. not a sarcastic ""thanks a lot"" type.

edit #2: i didn't buy it to spite him. i wanted the set originally, the kid was just there.

edit #3: here it is(https://brickset.com/sets/theme-star-wars/year-2008) (the first one, the ""imperial dropship"")

edit #4: i'm not an adult doing this out of spite. i'm currently 16, i did this 8 years ago. the kid was maybe 5 or 6.

"i had to steal my family's vhs after a porn movie got stuck in it.. when i was 14 i found my dad's stash of porn magazines and vhs movies. i played one of the movies (fuck my wife ii), after watching, i couldn't get the cassette out, it was stuck, i tried everything, including a knife and a hammer in a panicked state since my parents were coming home from work soon. i ended up stuffing it in my backpack, going out of the house with it and dumping it in a field near my house. my parents must have noticed the porn movie gone with the vhs player because they never asked about it (it was the only one we had and they bought another one right after)",11

"i beat up a kid because he kicked my elderly dog.. i was reminded of this when i read a venting post in r/dogs about a woman who restrained herself from slapping a child when the kid kicked her dog. several years ago i was in a similar situation, and i didn't restrain myself at all. 

when i was 23, my 14 year old beagle mix was diagnosed with a fast acting cancer that had already started to spread. i'd had him since he was 1 and i made it my mission in life to keep him as comfortable and happy as i could. there was nothing he loved more than walking in the park, so i packed him up in the car and we for a short and slow walk every day. 

he was the sweetest, friendliest boy so it was absolutely shocking when on one our walks, a boy we'd never seen before, who was probably 10-11 ran up to us screaming ""i hate your ugly, gross dog, lady!"". my initials response was ""ugh, ok, well we're just passing by, so goodbye then"". then the little jerk let out an inhuman screech and ran forward and kicked my dog in the stomach. my poor boy yelped and whimpered and crumpled to the ground in pain, and the kid laughed in that horribly demonic way only a child can laugh, and then reeled back to kick again. before that moment, i had never experienced rage as an adult. i'm pretty evenly keeled person, and i'm typically a pacifist and diplomat. this was the first and only time in my life that i saw red. 

before my brain had even processed what happened i'd already lunged at the kid and sort of half grabbed half shoved him by the neck, and pushed him to the ground very hard. he immediately burst into tears, and that's when i should have stopped. but i couldn't stop, it was the only time in my life when i felt like i wasn't in control of my actions. the kid was scrambling to get up and i kicked him really hard in the side, several times. then i grabbed him by his sweatshirt hood and screamed in his face at the top of my lungs. i screamed some really horrible things at him (something like that i'd find him and kill him slowly if he ever tried to hurt another animal again), but it felt like the words were just erupting out of me with no thought or effort. 

at that point the kid was ugly sobbing and apologizing and begging me to let him go, which i guess helped me to snap out of it, because i felt myself (for lack of a better description) return to my body. i felt totally numb and sort of inebriated but the rage was gone. i let the kid go, and told him to go find his mom, and hastily added ""and don't ever kick a dog again"". he ran off crying. i scooped my dog up, hustled to my car and left. 

i was oddly calm. i drove to the vet and told them only that a child had kicked my dog and ran away, and i wanted to get him checked out. they checked him out and said there was no serious damage, other than the beginnings of a bruise. i drove us home, got into the shower and sobbed for hours. i had no idea until then that i was capable of doing anything like that. 

i started therapy the next week to deal with the anger issues i didn't know i had until then, and i've never had another issue like that. i didn't go back to that park for years,  for fear of running into that kid again (mostly for fear that his parents would be there and get me arrested). i took freddy to a different park (that was a little further from the house, but he actually liked it more because it had good soft dirt to dig in) until his final day on earth. 

i think about that kid sometimes, though. i wonder how my actions impacted him. did i scare him straight? did i teach him to be more violent? does he have some complex about short women now because a short woman beat him up when he was a kid? he's gotta be at least a teenager now. i wonder how often he thinks about it, if ever. i wonder if he sees himself as being entirely the victim, or if by now he's loved and lost a pet, and understands the drive behind what i did. 

edit: wow....i posted this at like 4am and figured hardly anyone would see it, but this got a lot more attention than i was expecting. ",11
"i broke a girl's phone for bullying me in seventh grade, and got away with it. as the title says- in seventh grade, i excused myself from pe to go to the bathroom. while down there, i took the flip-phone of a girl who was bullying me from the locker room, and, without thinking about it, i broke it clean in half at the joint. then, i just put it back in her shoe, put the bookbag that was on the shelf above on top of it as if it had fallen down, washed my hands, went back to class, and pretended to be shocked when she found it and flipped out.

she suspected foul play and tried to blame me for it (i had been the only one to go to the bathroom that day), but with my reputation of being quiet and mild-mannered (and being a hell of a teacher's pet), nobody, no teacher or student,  would believe her over me.

sometimes, when i think about it even now that \~12 years have passed, i still feel vindicated. now i know it was likely her parents who needed to pay for it, but with the kinda shit she used to pull, at the time i thought she deserved it in full and felt no remorse. and i continue to not feel bad for it at all.",11

"i beat up a guy and my life was almost completely ruined.. a little over 8 years ago, i was doing a combined medical degree in a another country (the degree of which was recognised in my own country) and living on campus. the uni was quite large and within a month i had formed a group of friends with several others also studying medicine except one guy, we'll call him steve, who had barely made his science undergrad (a 3 year degree) and was in some of our classes, and decided he was part of our group. like me, he was living on campus. 

anyway, in most social interactions he'd always compete with me and another guy (being the only other guys in the group), yet my provocative remarks for most of his actions made me his target (to be fair he really was an idiot). the only reason he stayed as part of the group is because he acted as an emotional tampon for the girls and often paid for their stuff and bought them expensive gifts for birthdays etc. anyway, he began to become more frustrated with each passing semester, barely passing, and embittered due to his failure to find a girl which he *always* complained about (his reasoning was that he was always so nice and should be, i guess, somehow compensated for that).

3 years into my degree, i was doing well, however steve had failed his 3rd year exams meaning he would have to repeat his last year, meaning one more year stuck with him. at this point, his toxic personality meant he was blacklisted from most social events and was rarely invited to hang out with us (the girls had finally had enough of him i guess) and he was stuck in this mental quagmire of inadequacy and frustration at not knowing how to rectify his social and academic failures. i had little do with him at this stage although he still hated me with a passion.

one day i got very sick. maybe i'd like to state now (it's relevant later) that i was dating a girl who was pressuring me for a long term relationship, yet i was stringing her along with no thoughts further than dates or sex. i would leave the country soon and she'd try to convince me to stay, which i couldn't. i was planning to end the relationship within a couple months. during my intense sickness, steve decided he'd report to the uni that i overdosed on hard drugs, which resulted in the police being called and me being dragged over the city with a splitting headache and sore body to the police headquarters to do a drug test. the machine was malfunctioning so the officer made me stay the night there (which i didn't know at the time was illegal), resulting in me getting more sick (vomiting, diarrhoea, etc) in a cell. it was shit.

the next day the machine was fixed and the tests were negative, obviously, and i was free to go. i was on the other side of a large city though, with no money phone or anything. had to call my girl from police phone to pick me up. i found out a week later steve was the one who had reported me.

i waited about 6 months, avoiding steve and letting this blow over as well as observing him. he came back every friday night from nearby club, drunk, at about 2 am to the dorms. the girl i was dating knocked on my rooms door about twice a week for you know what. i made sure to wait for a week where she'd come over on a thursday, so she wouldn't come over the next day, friday. anyway i locked my door but opened my window which i could climb into from the outside (i was on ground floor). dressed in all black i waited on a bench on the road that steve used to walk to the dorms. when he came past i proceeded to beat the crap out of him. i placed his unconscious body on the bench and ran back to the dorms, hid the clothes underneath my cupboard and went to sleep.

nobody saw steve the next few days day, but soon he returned to uni. from hospital. i thought ""i hadn't beaten him *that* hard"" (he was drunk and i'd stopped when he was unconscious). but apparently some other people had found him and had stolen his phone, wallet, shoes and pants but for some reason, decided to also stab him in the leg. at that point i was a bit scared because if i got caught, i would obviously have been thought to have done all of that.

i disposed of the clothes a month later.

this is the end my confession but its get more interesting. 

2 months later, i hadn't been caught and steve was still angry trying to get to bottom of things. i was looking for a chance to break up with this girl because she was telling her family about me and was organising for me to meet them, but for some reason i waited a bit longer to end things. either way, i wasn't staying in this country. she knocked on my door one morning and said we needed to talk, i thought ""here we go again"" and i'd have to tell her i like taking things slow, i'm not ready to take our relationship to the next step etc. i thought that maybe this would be the right time to break up with her. however, she said none of that. she told me she knocked on my door one friday night 2 months ago.

i won't go into details because you know what the conversation was like, but she had decided not to report my absence that night because she loved me. long story short i went to her family dinner because i needed her to keep that secret and stayed with her for the next 2 years just because of that.

after the degree i got on the first plane back to my country. no regrets.",11
"i stole a pizza from little caesar's. i was broke and hungry so i decided to go to little caesar's for some $5 pizza, i went there and ordered my food, but for some reason she didn't make me pay up front and instead i would have to wait a few minutes since they'l were out of pizza at the moment. ok, no big deal. as i was standing to the side, a busload of kids walked in and went straight to the cashier, and she started taking their orders while another worker someone set my pizza on the counter and told to have a great day, so i assumed he thought i already paid.

the cashier was completely focused on the busload of kids that came in, and wasn't paying any attention to me. i looked at the door which was wide open and then looked at her, and saw that she was completely focused on the long line of kids instead of me. although i've never shoplifted in my life but i'd rather not wait 10 minutes for the line to finish, so i thought in my head ""fuck it, i'm gonna do it"". and i fast walked out the door to my car with my pizza without paying.

for the next few days i was scared they would a surveillance pic of me to the local news station or something and saying that there was a warrant for my arrest. i guess they didn't realize they were missing a pizza or that the cashier forgot about me since i never got arrested or saw anything about it on the news. this was about a year ago but i still feel bad about it. i haven't been to that little caesar's ever since.

"i missed a whole day of work because i stayed in bed trying to resume a dream i was having where i had a small chance of getting laid. that's how infrequently i have sex.. edit:
thanks for the support.

to clarify, i have had sex like, a couple times. 3 times with first girlfriend ever in 2008, once with another ladyfriend in 2009, i think 5 or 6 times with my ""most serious"" ""girlfriend"" that i dated for a whole 2 months in 2012. two one-night stands over the next 5 years, then my second most serious ""girlfriend"" i saw for about 6 weeks, we had sex like, 5 times, that was toward the end of last year.

tbh i don't crave sex as much as i crave just some kind of physical contact with someone who genuinely likes me, even just some non-sexual cuddling. i mean, i have a decent handful of friends who i'm close to, but just about every woman i know has a boyfriend (not that any of them have shown interest in me as more than a friend anyway), and online dating just never goes anywhere. i'll talk and talk and talk and we seem to get along great, but the moment i mention getting together irl, they're gone. i try getting to the irl meet right away, they don't respond to that either. shit sucks.

edit 2: to those suggesting getting a pet, i do have an amazing little kitty and she has helped me through my darkest hours. while a 9lb cat can't quite offer that physical contact that you get from a hug from a fellow human, it is pretty tough to stay too depressed when she hops on the couch, flops over placing her head on my lap, and looks up at me with with those big kitty-eyes. i strongly recommend a pet to anyone struggling with depression.

and while i've said i hate people, i'm actually a very friendly guy on the personal level and get invited to plenty of social events, i do my best to be a ""fun pessimist"". the comedian doug stanhope is a pretty close match for my personality, like, all fucked up in the head and clearly depressed and thoroughly dissatisfied with society, but as long as we're here, fuck it, let's try to have some fun.

as for the dream, i didn't get laid, but i did get a kiss from my old highschool crush so that was nice, and then i got to fly a spaceship, so, not a total loss i guess?

edit 3: wow this blew up way more than i thought it would. for those suggesting a hobby group: my main hobbies are video games, metalworking and shooting, unfortunately, very male-oriented hobbies (i'm bi, but my interest in men is pretty strictly sexual and only pops up from time to time, and as i've clarified, it's more of an emotional and intimate contact i'm looking for, rather than casual sex). though i am a crazy cat person, maybe volunteer at a cat shelter?

the reason i've always gone for online dating while ignoring most ""conventional"" dating opportunities, is that i'm really a pretty weird dude, not a total freakshow, but there are a number of things about me/things i need in a partner that i'd really rather get out of the way right off the bat, instead of spending several weeks building a relationship with them only to find out that it's extremely important to them to have kids (i'm 29 and that seems to be especially big to most single women out there my age), or that they're saving themselves for marriage and will only do missionary with the lights off so jesus will be happy with them, or that they believe trump is our savior and football players kneeling during the anthem should be convicted of treason, or that they believe that you're literally hitler if you didn't vote for hillary and you laugh at racist jokes.
(all of these things have happened when i tried tinder and doing the old ""don't reveal significant details about yourself"" dating style that most people seem to do)

would it be especially un-kosher for me to say right off the bat: ""before we get too far into this, i'm an atheist libertarian with a kinky side, i definitely don't want kids, and my sense of humor is so dark it's only counted as 3/5s of a sense of humor, are you cool with that?""",11

"i know a secret that i wish i didn't.. years ago before i met my so, he applied for the police academy in our town. he never heard from them to report for training, so he figured he wasn't selected and moved on with the intention to try again later. years pass, we meet, he builds a career in another field, we start a family. he hears that the pd is actively recruiting and he goes for the physical. he passes! i mention in passing to his mother that so is considering joining the pd. 

she pauses and says ""really?! you'd let him do that? i threw his acceptance letter in the trash when he applied the last time."" she begged me not to tell him. she was worried about her boy going into such a dangerous profession. 

i told her ""he can never know, and i wish i didn't."" he would never forgive her. 

the conflicted tag is for my feelings toward my mil, who has been so kind, generous, and supportive and more like a mother to me than my own mother. i'm horrified and i love her despite her actions but i'm careful with what i share with her. 

edit: i appreciate all your replies, and i choose to believe that all your advice comes from a good and well-meaning place. there is a lot of water under this particular bridge, i've chosen my path, and i accept the consequences. my loyalty is with so, and can see nothing that would be gained by telling him and a helluva lot that could be lost. go be good to each other. 

edit2: there is so much projection going on here that i feel i must clarify further. 
1. so is not bitter about a lost opportunity to follow his ""passion.""  how passionate do you think he was when he didn't follow up on any job in police work for 20+ years and when he did reapply, he dropped his candidacy because he's already got a good gig? that was his choice. 
2. the horror of this is that he was denied the choice to accept the original opportunity and i cannot change that. we know that his mom is meddling and anxious, but this was on a whole other level. we are very far away from her and very much in control of our adult lives now. 
3. as far as him finding out and dumping me is concerned, he is not a stupid man, and i carry the health insurance. cheers. ",11
"i slapped someone across the face and blamed it on a tic.... i have tourettes syndromes and my class and teachers know. my school is pretty diverse and generally very accepting but you always have some narrow minded jerks. 

at the beginning of the year, i was in math and this dude was making these really homophobic and just plain disgusting comments to his friend (who was clearly uncomfortable but didn't do anything) about this one girl in our class who was a proud lesbian. (this girl is like he sweetest person you will ever meet. she's always ready to help anyone and she doesn't have a mean bone in her body.) anyways, they were making these comments and some of the ones i remember were ""i bet i could fuck her and turn that bitch straight"", ""i bet her pussy's so tight"", ""she probably dates girls because no guy would fuck that whale body"" and a ton of just horrible comments. the poor girl was close to tears and her girlfriend was watching the whole thing and wasn't doing anything. even the teacher was ignoring it. so i threw my pen across the room as if it was a tic and stood up to go get it. as i walked past asshole one and two, i made a similar sound to what i make when i tic and slapped this dude across the face. i immediately started apologizing and making my eyes water. i act a lot so i know how to cry on demand. he was pissed but he stopped bothering the girl and afterwards the girl came up to me and thanked me. i played dumb and she left. her and her girlfriend broke up a few days later.

"when i was 12, i blamed my mom's broken laptop on my 2 year old brother.. when i was 12, i used to watch my little pony...as a boy. obviously, being a boy watching a show viewed as for girls, i didn't let anyone know i did, except my mom when she caught me watching it on her laptop. she encouraged it because she didn't want to embarrass my possibly gay sexual orientation (i'm not gay, ladies ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)).

anyways, that sounded like a tangent but its why the computer broke.

my aunt (who is only a year older than me and is considered my sister) and i often fought over the computer, seeing as it was neither of ours, therefore both of ours. if you shared something with a sibling, you know what i mean by that.

one day when i was in my moms room, watching mlp as silently as possible, my aunt comes in and demands i give it to her so she could play on it. i said no because i was watching something. when i didn't tell her after she asked what i was watching, she tried to snatch it from me, dropping the laptop on the floor and breaking the screen. we both froze, blamed each other for a little bit, then decided that my mom wouldn't get mad at my 2 year old brother.

"i was the school phantom shitter. if i had let this secret out during its time i would've been mortified, crucified, and full of shame. however, i now laugh on it and tell the story. 

i was always a pretty normal kid. i was in 9th grade, and my best friend, ian, and i did cross country together. it was a rainy day so coach had us run on the indoor track in circles. we both look at each other and both say ""i gotta take a dump."" 

we snuck away from practice and went to the locker room. ian got in first and the other stall had some sort of hellish shitticane going on there in which no one would dare use even in an emergency. 

so, you know that one pair of shoes in the locker room that have been in there forever and no one had ever claimed them nor have they moved in what seemed like an eternity? well, i just had to shit. my 14 or 15 year old self also thought it would be hilarious to show him the massive dump i was about to produce and in a shoe because ya know, teenage boys are stupid and have that kind of humor (i still do and always will btw). i proceed to open the tongue of the shoe and drop the single fattest and longest turd into these mid top nikes. he comes out, and i have this shit eating grin. i told him to go over to where the shoes were and he goes ""aw dude gross, that's sick!!"" (sick as in gross). we had our laughs and returned to practice and never thought anything of it. 

however 

the next day, there was a bit of commotion in gym class in second period. the locker room reeked of doodoo. people were frantically looking but no one could find the source. then, jermaine comes in and yells, ""mangggg, someone shit in my shoeeee"" for the rest of the day, everyone was looking for the phantom shitter wondering who did it. ian and i kept our mouths shut and to this day, no one has ever found out who took a shit in jermaine's shoe. i have moved since then several times, so whoever i tell it to has no connection to my old high school.

since so many people were rotated through laundry duty, no one ever found out it was me and i sure as hell never confessed to it.  

sorry guys.",11
"i ended my ex-bestfirend's career, ruining her life.. title basically.

this was a few years ago. i use to be friends with this girl in college (we'll call her jackie) and were both pursuing our nursing degrees. we got along really well for a majority of the school year except towards the end. i began liking a boy, who she knew about, and then had sex with him anyway. we both talked about it and she understood how hurt i was and promised never to do something like that again. 

fast forward to nearing our graduation (like 1 year later), another boy i had been seeing for a while who came to our place for a pre-party. we all left at the same time (jackie and i shared an apartment) and then went to the party.jackie left and so did the boy (i figured they were both going to campus together since we had apartments next to eachother) and so i just stayed with the rest of my group. i came back, only to hear them having sex...i was devastated. he was my boyfriend, and i finally thought i found the one. it was a few short months, yes, but still, he was so sweet and i thought he cared about me). i knew i needed to get back at her for hurting me, and here is how i did. 

we both smoked marijuana...heavily. after graduation, i still was pretending to like her. we both moved back home (which ironically was close to each other) and began working at the same hospital as nurses (different units). our hospital had a **strict** drug policy which forbid any drug use. i stopped smoking, but she didn't.

i would always convince her to and i'd just have a drink or pretend to take a hit from it. sometimes i'd even 'fake roll' one and just smoke a cigarette while she smoked marijuana. after about two months of me stopping marijuana, and her continuing, i left an anonymous note on my managers desk saying ""jackie is high now. you need to test her."" she would never go to work high, just smoke a day before her shift-she was never ever inebriated while working. 

...well...about 1 hour later occupation health came and **everyone** (doctors, techs, unit clerk, cleaning staff, etc) was tested on the unit (to prevent any discrimination), and if you left, you would be breaking policy and risk termination. jackie immediately texted me after freaking out in the break room that she needed to talk. i ran up and faked to have no idea and was comforting her saying it'd be fine and nothing to worry about.

1 week later: **terminated.** she violated the drug policy which results in immediate termination. she was blacklisted at the hospital and all nearby ones as well. because of the state i was in too (ny), at the time it was a controlled substance, which made it especially bad.

we worked at that hospital for only a few months. now? she has only been able to work in a local office as a nurse/receptionist, making about 1/4 of what she could've been. no other job will hire it. (maybe one a few states away would, but i am not sure). do i regret this? yes. i was an asshole and fucked up, bad. will i ever tell her? probably not. but is karma a bitch? certainly.",11
"i wish my sister had died. this is my first ever post on reddit. sorry if i mess up a time or two.

my sister is five years older than me, but you wouldn't know it. she was born with a list of medical problems; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; verbal dyspraxia; profound deafness; severe brain damage. the doctors said she wouldn't live beyond a day, but she did. i wish she hadn't.

when i was born, my sister was in another hospital, in another state. she was seriously ill. they thought she might have ebola. my mother found out later that she was just having a severe allergic reaction to her epilepsy medication, but at the time, they thought she'd die. 

the instant i was born, i was handed off to a doctor and my mother flew to meet my sister in the hospital. my brother and i were left with a nanny, as my father worked 14 hour days. i didn't meet my mother until i was eight months old. that set the pace for the rest of my life.

my childhood was a whirlwind of moving from state to state, closer to whatever hospital had a program that would help her at the time. my brother and i were always pushed to the side. my mother was never really around, leaving us with our father for weeks at a time to be with my sister in the hospital. it took my mother years to figure out that he had an alcohol problem and had been abusing my brother and i. 

still, she couldn't do anything, because he paid my sister's medical bills and even if she left him, she needed to be a stay-at-home parent for my sister. so my brother and i fought through. we rarely got attention from our mother even when she was home, and never stayed in a place long enough to make any connections. 

there are other things people don't think about. my sister was older than i, so i'd copy her in a lot of things, but ultimately, i'd be blamed if something happened. i was to blame if she bit me and i struck out to get her off me, and accidentally hurt her. ""she's too fragile,"" my mother would scold, before leaving to reassure my sister, unaware that my father would take a belt to my butt for hurting the precious one. 

i had to know how to perform cpr at five, and had to deal with my sister's seizure alone for the first time when i was six. calling the emergency number in my country didn't stop the horror i'd been exposed to. 

my father pulling a gun on us when i was nine was what finally convinced my mother that my brother and i couldn't stay there anymore. we were moved across the country, once again had to leave everything behind. we were homeless and stayed with my mother's family while she stayed in a hotel near the house she wanted to renovate for us.

during that time, it was my and my brother's duty to care for my sister. i hated it. at nine years old, my aunt would drag me out of bed in the middle of the night and make me change the sheets on my sister's bed because she'd begun menstruating, and obviously, this wasn't a duty my brother could help me with, since he was a boy! 

a few months in, and my cousins invited over a friend. i knew something was off. he made crude jokes and liked playing with me and my female cousin (who was only a year older than me) too much for someone who had to be pushing 19. my mother had told me never to sleep in the same bed with a boy, but that night, i had to make a choice. my aunt (a deluded woman) asked if i wanted to share my bed with (the creepy family friend) or if my sister should. i made a choice, based on everything i'd been told throughout my life--you were only born to support your sister, your sole job is to protect her, it's your life duty--and i told her he could share my bed.

i guess you can imagine what happened. he molested me. it hurt. i remember holding a wet cloth between my legs and crying, just wishing someone would hold me. he did it three more times, each of those times i'd go into it, knowing what to expect, but knowing my sacrifice would mean my sister wouldn't have to deal with it.

i suspect my brother was also molested around that time. so it's no surprise that when we finally did move into a house, just the four of us, that my brother and i were emotionally wrecked. two little kids that had gone through hell, but my sister was always the priority. her wounds were visible. more important. my brother and i began being left alone. i got into self-harm and started starving myself, not because i particularly disliked the way i looked, but because i'd been taught from very early on that when your anger passes a certain point, you either take it out on yourself or others. i knew how much it hurt to have anger taken out on you, so i took my anger out on myself to spare anyone else that pain. i wanted to destroy myself, i was so furious.

now, my sister treats me like shit. she had no idea the sacrifices i've made for her, the way i gave up my mother, my friends, my mental state and my virginity to save her. she wouldn't appreciate it if she knew, either. her brain works at that of a three year old level. she's been spoiled by everyone her entire life, because of her disabilities, so she treats me like crap. my mother lets her, to avoid dealing with one of her tantrums.

other people treat me like her personal helper dog. they see her in a wheelchair and demand i translate (in sign language) some kind compliment to her without even asking my name or making eye contact with me. i'm just her assistant. 

i know it's illogical to blame her for all these things that are beyond her control, to resent her like this, but i can't seem to help it. i haven't hurt her since i was eight and i scratched her cheek, and i wouldn't ever dare hurt her, but i hate her with a fiery passion. i fantasise about her dying and for a moment feel relief. i know that my life would've been a lot easier if she hadn't lived past her first day.

update: 
is it too early for one of these? i don't know, but i was overwhelmed by the amount of positive feedback this post gained. i honestly expected to post this, hopefully relieve some of the guilt that's begun to affect my day-to-day life and infect my nightmares, maybe get a comment or two from someone who thought i needed to receive serious help, but i never expected this amount of support and kindness. 

the advice has been so helpful and i really appreciate everyone who's sharing their own stories. i've met people with disabled and sick siblings before, of course, by the amount of time i spend visiting my sister in the hospital, but we obviously don't tend to go into such dark topics like this. so knowing that i'm not a one-off terrible person for feeling this way is such a relief, especially with that movie my sister's keeper that was released just as i was beginning to feel such resentment, and made me feel even worse. 

anyway, that said, there's a few things that keep coming up and i'd like to explain, since i'd just be repeating myself if i replied to every comment (again, wow, really didn't expect that amount of comments). 

1. i never did and probably will never report my molester. his father is a very respected policeman and so far, every member of law enforcement that i've run into has let me down. while i know i deserve justice, i also believe i deserve peace and the ability to build a life without this following me around. also, i honestly just don't have the strength to go through that process. i've spent years debating speaking up, because i don't want to risk him hurting another girl, but i just don't have the strength to do that. as horrible as it sounds, unless another girl comes out and says he sexually abused her (which, in my community, i would hear about) i don't think i'll ever speak up. 

2. there's a lot of comments saying my mother is the one i should be angry at, because she's the one who abused and neglected me. i agree. she made some really bad choices. she's held my sister's wellbeing above my brother's and mine our entire lives. i'll never be able to reconcile with some of the choices she's made, they're that bad, and maybe it's just my instinct to protect her, but there was a lot more going on than i mentioned in this post. 

my father was severely abusing my mother and completely isolated her. she was genuinely trapped. she tried to protect us and honestly thought that he'd never lay a hand on us, which was a really stupid risk to take. i spent years being furious at her. my brother is still furious at her. but she did the best she could for all of us, even though she did hold my sister above my brother and i. as soon as she realised he was abusing us too, she left with us. my mother has a tenth grade education and a family just as fucked up as the one she supplied for me. she's never had an instinct to protect my brother or i, but i think she did the best she could for us.

she also, though she made sure i knew my sister's needs were always way more important than mine, and that my sister was way more important than me, and that i would have to care for her after she died, she also never tried to control me like my father did. my father was the one who groomed me as a helper, beating me with a belt if i didn't do something my sister asked, and telling me i'd never be allowed to follow my dream of being a journalist because it's a dead-end career, what with all the social media sites out these days. he said i could never support my sister with the measly paycheck a journalist earns. my mother always supported anything i wanted to do.

3. my father wouldn't have been an alcoholic if my sister wasn't born. he would've had a lot of problems, and probably would've found an addiction, but it wouldn't have been as bad as it was. my mother also would've been free to leave him, and she definitely would've, if she hadn't had my sister to think about. my father took up alcohol immediately after i was born. i was a difficult pregnancy. my mother had pre-eclampsia and her placenta kept separating from the uterine wall. they delivered me prematurely and frankly, i wasn't supposed to live, either. my mother had lost a lot of blood and was in the icu for two days before being released (and immediately flying out to meet my sister). so, in these two days, my father was told he was probably going to lose me, my mother and my sister. that's when he snapped.

4. i live in australia. medicare is great and offers a block of therapy sessions that insurance takes care of before you have to start paying. i plan to take advantage of that, as well as privileges i could receive at university. thank you all for your advice and support. i've never felt so much love and understanding and i cannot even begin to describe how much it means to me.

by the way, guess who got the acceptance email from her choice university today? it's close to where my brother lives with his girlfriend and her family. he's struggled with all this, too. started running away when i was twelve, disappearing for days, and started having sex the year after. i was fourteen when he started doing drugs and i was fifteen when i got into the car with him before realising he was drunk and high. he was pulled over and arrested for dui. i was dropped back at home by a policeman who acted as if i was the one who'd driven drunk.

however, last year my brother got a girl pregnant and has desperately been trying to pull himself together since then. we're very close, since we're the only two people who truly understand what the other's been through, but we never talk about anything that's happened. he reluctantly attends therapy and has an apprenticeship and his son has just started crawling. he's relapsed, of course, just as i have (though i haven't self-harmed in years and don't ever plan to touch alcohol) but we're working through it. he also spent much of my childhood protecting me (my best childhood memories, sadly, are climbing into bed with him when my father had gotten really drunk and begun slamming doors and smashing dishes. he used to read to me or we'd watch a show on his laptop until we could fall asleep) so i'm trying to repay him by protecting him now, in whatever little sister way i can.

so, yeah. i don't think i'll update again, but i knew if i'd been a stranger reading this post, i'd want to know the answer to these questions, too. rest assured, my brother and i are receiving help and are on the way to a healthy life. neither of us live for our sister anymore. he lives for his son, and i live for myself. 

(also, fuck you, dad. guess who's studying to become a journalist?)

"i haven't went to any of my college classes or done any of the work for them since the start of the semester but i've been telling my parents i have.. this is my first year at school and i thought that i could do it but i just kept ignoring all my schedules and have stayed home in my apartment almost every day and only go out at night. mostly it is because i am extremely mentally ill now, i think more of psychosis than depression. but i can't tell my parents why i am like that because i would have to do an insane amount of explaining. 


i am wasting my money and everyone else's time but i can't seem to get it together. i had insanely good grades in highschool too and i feel like this would be far to unexpected for my parents to believe without any further explanations. 

i'm thinking about dropping out but i'd have to find another place to live because they only let students live in my place so i would have to sublet to another student. i have like one ""boyfriend"" from high school i could stay with at his other house he has near my school but i don't know if this would make my life better or worse. 

i feel like an absolute let down and like i just wasted one of the biggest priveleges and opportunities in life.

edit: i really appreciate all the response but i feel like i've misconstrued some things. i am not stressed about the actual schoolwork i actually took a summer semester and i did very well and got mostly 90s. i don't want to sound arrogant but my problem is more my mental health, i am dealing with issues of sexual assault and old relationships etc. i really do appreciate all the motivation and advice :)",11
"when i was in highschool i catfished a guy i hated and found out he was into furry/bestiality porn. so i grew up in a small town with a small school system (250 graduates) and there had been one kid that plagued me practically 5th grade to senior year. he was mean, dismissive, and always made a point to put me down or call me stupid. anyways through a friend of a friend of a damn friend i found out this kid had an edgy ass tumblr account. 

mfw: https://goo.gl/images/llwmwt

the night of this discovery, i hatched a plan. i made a fake tumblr account calling myself stacy (it's not my name) and saying i was from california (it feels like everyone's from there) and posting typical girl tumblr stuff, getting followers, etc. 

i basically spent a week concocting and grooming this fake account of mine - there couldn't be any flaws. 

once i felt like my mask had been adequately made i popped him a pm

""hey i like your profile pic, is that you?  ;-)"" 

i waited for what seemed like hours, checking and rechecking my account to make sure there was absolutely no way he can tell it was me. suddenly, my inbox notification lit up:

""yeah, wanna see more ;-)"" 

success. 

for the next few days i had texted this kid, digging into his personal life and his secrets, trying to find anything that would give me a leg up on him. it didn't take long for him to get comfortable with an anonymous girl with the thirst he had, and things started to get....fuzzy. 

i'll never forget it. i was up in bed, getting a little sleepy, when he messages me: 

""hey can i ask you a question?""

hm okay. i respond ""sure, go for it"" 

he takes a while to type but finally it comes out: 

""do u got any fetishes?""

i look at the time - 1 a.m. 
ah yes, the peak thirst hour

though i was feeling a little uncomfortable to be discussing this with a greasy fellow i knew, i decided to trek on.

thinking of the first fetish that comes to mind, i quickly respond ""ya i love tentacle porn""

without hesitation he responds ""oh..here's mine.."" and links me to his alt tumblr account: pages upon pages of drawn furry porn, gifs of people screwing animals (actual animals guys) and even a few pictures of him in cat ears and a tail. to say the least, i was shocked, and it almost hurt to look. 

after that i never responded. he continued to send me a few frantic messages but stopped after a few days. in school i struggled sitting across from him, knowing of the secret alias he lead. 

i had uncovered a goldmine of blackmail, but with such a prize came the curse of having to bear the knowledge that this kid wanted to screw animorphs and horses.

in the end, it was too cringey to even blackmail him with it, let alone tell anyone else about it. i just couldn't go through the awkward exchange that would be telling him it was me the whole time, and then have to go to school with him for another year. and when you think about it, we both kind of lost there.

but i don't care. 

screw you, kyle, you were mean and i've seen those weird ass pics of you and your fetish 

tl;dr: kid was mean, made account to catfish, uncovered dark furry secret, didn't tell anyone in end

"i have, for the past 2.5 years, been hiding printed photographs of academy award winning actor nicholas cage throughout my office.. no regrets

i don't know how many there are, and i don't remember where they are hidden. 

it started so small. it was a simple prank. there is a briefing on the bulletin board that has been hanging there from a thumb tack for as long as i've worked here. it's meant to be very important, but i have never seen anyone so much as glance at it. it's maybe ten pages, so it took it down, removed the staple, placed this photograph(https://goo.gl/images/l7m6qt) between its pages, and put it back together again. to this day, no one has noticed. 

so i decided to keep doing it. every now and then, when it's slow or everyone is away at a conference, i'll hide another one. i know for sure that there is one behind the calendar, and another taped to the back of a bookcase. there's a few in the conference room, i'm sure, and in the copy room and kitchenette. i think there's at least one in the director's office, though, if there isn't, that will soon be remedied. 

i plan to leave this job in a few months. i will tell no one when i leave, and i plan to hide many, many more before i go.

*edit-* thanks you guys! i didn't expect this to blow up. also, for those of you who are claiming this is dumb because i'll never see the pay off: i know. it's not about that. you're missing the point. also also, it doesn't really matter, but i am female. also also also, a sub sprang from this post! check out r/officeterrorism!

"my drug use finally caused me to lose my friends, my family, and, most likely, my job. and i deserve it all..  

throwaway for obvious reasons.

&#x200b;

this is very long, but i need to write it down.

&#x200b;

first  off, i'm a drug addict and i have diagnosed major depression disorder  and general anxiety disorder. i tried to self medicate with my drugs of  choice: otc pills, diphenhydramine (benadryl) and dextromethorphan  (robitussin.) i could never find a consistent person to buy marijuana  from, and when i did, i never really liked the high it gave me. so, i  went with otc drugs. they are everyone and easily accessible. i am  psychologically addicted to them.

&#x200b;

for  about 10 years, my drug issue has been my issue, it didn't really  effect anyone except me. my immediate family knew i was struggling with  it, but they would always support me and try to help with my recovery,  but six months ago that all changed. you should know that i deserve  everything that happened to me.

&#x200b;

it  started with losing my friends, i was tripping on roughly 1500mg of  dextromethorphan. i ruined a friendship with a great group of people in  the blink of an eye. while i was tripping on the 1500mg, i called and  left two very creepy and delusional social media voicemails on one of my  good friend's sister's account. she literally has no idea who i am, and  out of the blue, i leave two delusional sounding voicemails. one was,  ""hello! i know you're an expert in the medical field and i would like to  pick your brain on an idea that could **revolutionize the medical field.** i know this place **down by the river where we can talk.**""  thinking i left a very well thought out message while tripping out of  my mind, i hang up with a beam of self-confidence and pride that i'm  going to put this idea into action. ...but ***what the actual fuck***. i know a place *down by the river?* i have an idea that could *revolutionize the medical field*? who the hell speaks like that to a person that has **zero**  idea who i am. in my head, i'm thinking what a great idea i put forward  and what a great restaurant down on the riverfront we could discuss it  at. it was a quaint little new-age vegan place that prides itself on  making food that tastes delicious. i'm not vegan, but i had a date the  week before with a woman who is vegan, and i figured i'd try this place.  it was actually really good. so, i thought it would be a great place to  hit up again.

&#x200b;

she runs to her brother,  one of my best friends, about what i said and how i sounded. he messages  me to, ""get my shit together."" and like that, boom, friendship lost;  gone, in the blink of an eye. he is one of the most laid back  individuals that rarely gets mad or pissed off. but i went too far, *i always go too far,*  i brought an unknown individual into my fucked up life, and not only  was it an unknown individual, but his sister. what the fuck was i  thinking? i wasn't thinking i'm a drug addict. the news quickly spreads  around the friend group; we are pretty tight. or well, we **were**  pretty tight. well actually, they still are a pretty tight group, i'm  just kicked out. and it's deserved. i deserved to lose my friends. good  people do not hang around drug addicts and people who make awful  decisions. good people don't enable that behavior; they leave. and  that's what they did. they left. i have no one to blame but myself. no  more invites to go bowling. no more invites to go to a bbq. no more  invites to hang out and watch a sports game on a random night. it's  gone. and it's my fault.

&#x200b;

the interesting  thing at this point is that before i messaged his sister on my drug  addled, induced, insane brain, i was actually clean for about six  months. not too bad, right? six months is a long time to be clean for a  struggling addict. but it doesn't matter; the first of three strong  pillars that i use to lean on is reduced to nothing. i was never  ""formally"" kicked out of our friend group; it was just understood. i  know to not come around anymore. i know to seclude myself. i read  between the lines. no more chances; no more forgiveness. i crossed the  line. i went too far for the last time. and it's my fault. there's no  one to blame but me.

&#x200b;

knowing this, i turn  to more drugs, i quit the robitussin and go back to my favored drug of  choice benadryl. i'm downing a 50 to 100 25mg diphenhydramine pills a  day. and this stuff stays in your system for **days.**  my eyes are dilated for at least two days. i'm pale, and my skin is  flushed. i can't put coherent sentences together, and i sweat like a  gross pig. just drenched at any given moment.

&#x200b;

this  is where i lose my family. my family has weekly dinners on sunday just  for us to hang out and catch up from the week. i come over stoned out of  my mind for the first time in months, and the first thing my father  says to me is, ""i'm not going to deal with you when you're like this.""  he knew immediately. everyone knew immediately when i walked in. it was  left at that, but no one would talk to me, or listen to what i said. i  was ignored because they were **not**  going to humor a drug addict. i was ignored. i didn't even realize i  was being ignored. i kept thinking with the shit overconfidence the drug  can give you, that i was great and everything was awesome. narrator: it  wasn't. two weeks later i notice something, my family has a group chat  and all of a sudden they aren't talking in it anymore. i didn't realize  that they made a new one, and they made a new one because they don't  want a drug addled human around two little nieces and one little nephew.   that makes complete sense, right? get the drug addict out. we don't  want him around. who wants a drug addict around? no one. i only put it  together when i showed up randomly on a sunday, and my mother and father  both say, ""what are you doing here?"" but not in the ""oh, it's nice to  see you,"" but in the ""why are you over here stoned? we don't want you  here."" i replied with, ""it's sunday. we get together on sundays."" and  they both just reply, ""oh."" the next week was my brother's birthday, and  i received a call two days before saying i was more than welcome to  come, but that i had to pay my own way at the restaurant. that's a huge  red flag. my parents **never**  make us pay when we go out to eat as a family. the reason they said i  would have to pay is because they were done supporting my addiction. if i  was going to get stoned, and come around the family blitzed out of my  mind, i was not going to get any of the perks of the family. that makes  total sense. for years they've held my hand to try and help me with my  drug issue, and they were finally done holding my hand. something needed  to change that showed me they wouldn't deal with my shit anymore. it's a  wake-up call for me. it is deserved. i'm not blind to the consequences  i'm bearing because of the choices i made. duh, it's obvious. it makes  sense. maybe, to them, and finally me, it will be the only way they get  through to me. nothing else worked, so maybe this might. on the day of  my brother's birthday, i forgot it was his birthday. usually a text  would get sent out to the family group giving everyone a reminder, but  remember, they aren't using the family group message i'm in. they made a  separate one. they didn't even ask why i didn't show up. i brought it  up and said, ""sorry i forgot about your birthday. no one sent me a  reminder message."" they all just kinda looked at my like, ""oh. okay.""  they figured i was high, and you know what, i was high. and why would  they want that around? they don't. they are finished. today is sunday.  they used to put out a reminder text that we will get together today.  and they will put out the text, but i won't receive it. i've lost my  family due to my own choices. i, just like my friends, will seclude  myself from them. it's my punishment; it's my hell. i deserve it.

&#x200b;

now,  i've lost my friends and my family to due my decisions. i am purposely  secluding myself because it's the apt punishment for being the person i  am. as a result, i've been doing more and more drugs. i've been going  into work the past three weeks stoned. it's obvious; and my coworkers  and boss are furious. though they won't say it to my face. it's a great,  hardworking company, but no bullshit as well. it's literally a dream  job and position, and i'm shooting myself in the foot. my outside of  work decisions are influencing my work. businesses don't give a shit the  reason why you're having a bad time or whatever excuse you can come out  with; it's a job and you work. they haven't told me yet, but i can feel  the dominoes falling. people are very short with me. i'm ignored. and  the big one: my boss holds monthly one-on-one meetings with her  subordinates to gauge how they are feeling and how the job is going.  pretty nice, right? however, when i ask, she provides me **zero constructive criticism, and they are taking work away from me.**  those are literally the two biggest red flags that an employee is about  to get fired. she also constantly talks about how, ""this job may not  fit for me,"" and how ""maybe i should look into working a different job.""  **fuck.** however, this company  is literally my dream job. all i can do is to hopefully repair what  little reputation i have left by doing the absolute best i can and  working diligently to change my behavior. i have to get lucky; i have to  hope i'm given the benefit of the doubt. but i'm literally down to the  last straw. it's not outwardly said, but i can read the signs. if it's  one thing i know how to do, is how to read people when they are  disgusted with me and pissed at me. i'm so used to seeing those  micro-expressions on people's faces due to my addiction. disappointment,  anger, disgust. drug addicts know what those faces look like because  they always see those faces. but it's not like i don't deserve it. it's  absolutely unacceptable the way i'm behaving in a company that took a  chance to invest in me. i can only hope it's not too late.

&#x200b;

i  feel myself in my spiral downwards. i'm going to hit soon, and i'm  going to hit hard. and there is no one to blame but me. i've already  lost my friends and family. i'm most likely going to lose my job. my  depression is at an 11/10 right now and thoughts of suicide are roaring  through my brain. i'm of age. i can legally purchase a firearm. the only  thing that's stopping me is a shred of hope that forgiveness is still  possible. i need to get lucky. but there is no reason i deserve that  luck. i am what choices i make. and i've made awful choices. i deserve  the repercussions that have come and will come from the decisions i  made.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: my drug addiction has  finally caught up with me. i've lost my family and friends, and i'll  probably lose my job soon. the consequences i receive are in line with  what i deserve. there is no one to blame but me.",11
"i accidentally had a sexting relationship with my brother on here.... then kept doing it even after i found out.. so. yeah. that happened. i am a 24 year old female and my brother is 27. 

around 2 years ago when i first joined reddit on my old account i posted to nsfw subreddits a lot. i am fairly confident in my body and didn't mind showing it off at the time. now that i have a boyfriend, however, my tune has changed on that subject matter. 

i'd post at least twice a day and get a bunch of messages. one guy kept commenting and messaging me, telling me i was sexy and how much he loved my body. for some reason i kept talking to him and we basically developed a sexual relationship and sexted all the time, but we never showed our faces. he was very nice and sweet to me even when we weren't talking about sex. keep in mind that i was always very private about my identity because i didn't want anyone to blackmail me. 

i even made up a name and location as to where i lived. i thought it was a bit weird that this guy had the same name as my brother (although my brother *is* very good looking and 10/10 would bang if he wasn't my brother) and lived in the same state, but figured it was simply a coincidence. 

for his birthday a few months after we met, he sent me a pic of himself without a shirt on and his magic stick erect and told me he wished i was there to suck him off and asked me if i liked the new tattoo he got for his 25th birthday..... 

but i was. 

in the living room downstairs.

celebrating my brother's birthday.

his 25th one.

it was the same tattoo my brother showed me earlier that day.

it was the same bathroom. same shower curtains. same hair products. same perfume. same toothbrush colors. same everything.

i was mortified, but i didn't stop. my brother really is a hot guy and i liked what he had below the equator. i couldn't help myself, so i continued to sext with him for a few more months until i told him i had gotten a boyfriend and could no longer do that with him. he understood and we went our separate ways.

the worst part? i still touch myself to his pics on occasion.


edit: yes, this is real. as for the people talking about how we didn't recognize each other by the same house and such, i was in college and lived in a dorm room. it was not the room i had at my parents' house. my brother has a fairly plain room and sheets. i thought it was normal to have only white, black, and navy sheets. yes i had seen my brother shirtless before, but i had never seen his dick and he didn't always show his full body in the pics he'd send. 

edit 2: we would post the pics on imgur then send the link in private message. it's quite simple.",11
"when i was a young child i helped my mom hide her cheating from my dad and i've lived with the guilt ever since i realized what i did.. this will be a lengthy wall of text post because i have been keeping this in for so long.

&#x200b;

first she isn't actually my real mom but my much older sister. my birth parents had me late in life but were killed by a drunk driver when i was a toddler and i have no memories of either of them. my sister and her husband adopted me and i have always known them as my parents and their two children as my younger siblings.

&#x200b;

my dad had a job at the time that required him to travel from home frequently.

when i was maybe five or six my mom cheated on my dad.  i don't remember too much of the specifics but i do remember a time there were two strange men i've never seen before in our house when  my dad was out of town.  one of the guys had even played xbox with me while the other guy was alone with my mom in her room. as a kid i didn't know what they were doing.  afterwards mom told me and my younger brother to keep it a secret from dad. i remember other instances of mom having me and my brother in the car when she went to pick up men i didn't know and bringing them home.

&#x200b;

i don't know how much time passed but i remember dad asking me if any strange men came over the house at night saying that my brother told him about them. i immediately lied to my dad and told him that i've never seen any strange men around and that my brother was making things up.  nothing else happened after that and my dad eventually got a new job that didn't require as much travel.

&#x200b;

i feel guilty for what i did but am too afraid to ask my mom about it. its been over fifteen years since then and my mom and dad seem to be happily married. i have a younger brother still in school and i don't want to break up the family over something that might not even be real.  i feel guilty and hurt because my dad has always treated me with love and support and no differently than how he treats his real sons. i'm afraid that if he ever found out he would cut me out of his life, which is stupid i know, i mean i was only a little kid but still.

&#x200b;

i try to rationalize keeping it a secret thinking that maybe he already knew since the suspicion was there and maybe they had worked it out behind the scenes when i was still an ignorant school kid. so talking about it would only bring back painful memories.

&#x200b;

i just really hate my mom sometimes and get these angry suspicions that she is still cheating when there is no evidence of it, but i hide it well. i blame her for my fear of being cheated on, but i still love her. so i just keep it inside.

&#x200b;

edit: thank you so much everyone for your kind words. i was really afraid i would just see a bunch of posts shaming my mom and calling her names, which is not what i wanted to see.  i know what she did was awful but i still love her.",11
"i caused the house fire which killed my brother 5 years ago. throwaway account because of obvious reasons.

&#x200b;

when i was 15 i had some of my friends over while i was watching my 11 year old brother. my parents worked a night shift and i had to babysit him often. which i did not mind because i'd usually bring my friends over, and my brother wouldn't care really. it was around 10:00 pm and it was on a friday and my brother was asleep so we wanted to have some fun. so one of my friends brought over weed. we were in my room and one of my friends knew how to block the smell of the weed with this thing he made that would block the weed smell so we could smoke in the house. after we all ended up getting high we decided we wanted to chill in the basement. we were down there for around 15 minutes. eventually we wanted to go up to my room again. when we opened the basement door the whole house was foggy and smelled like smoke and i could see the fire spreading to our downstairs living room area since our house was two stories. i grabbed my phone and i opened the exit of the basement door and me and my friends ran out as quickly as possible while i called 911. my brother was upstairs sleeping and all i could remember was just crying, coughing and being so dizzy from the shock and the smoke. i called my parents too and they rushed home and they got here after the ambulance and firefighters. when my parents got home the fire in the house was gone and i remember the paramedics rushing my brother on a stretcher  into the ambulance. my mom went in the ambulance with my brother and my dad drove us to the hospital. we found out most of his body had 3rd degree burns, and he was unstable and unconscious due to the smoke. i was not allowed to see my brother while i was there and i had to keep waiting for my mom and dad to tell me everything was ok. my parents and i stayed at the hospital all night and a little into the morning and eventually my mom and dad came out (because they were allowed to see him) to tell me that he was passing away due to the smoke inhalation. after our house was investigated for what could have started the fire we were told that it started in my room and they found a metal lighter. i remember bursting into tears telling my parents why i had a lighter in my room and what happened and i remember saying it was all my fault. to this day i still feel the worst amount of guilt for what happened, and my parents have told me so many times that i didn't know that this would happen. they said they weren't angry with me but i still feel like they had some sort of anger towards me at that moment. the house was completely gone, and we were lucky we had insurance and were even able to afford a new one.

&#x200b;

i'm 20 now, and i go to college and have a part time job, but the guilt still haunts me so much and i think about how my brother would have gone on to do amazing things. i know deep down that it wasn't completely my fault and that i didn't know this would happen, but it still did. my mom and dad tell me all the time that they aren't angry with me and that i was young and didn't know that this would have happened.",11

"i used to bully kids for being gay in high school, while i was secretly having gay sex and was hiv positive. i lied and said i had tried heroin to cover up the fact that i got hiv from gay sex.. this was the early-mid 2000s when i was in high school. i was sort of the cool kid in high school, i played sports, i went to parties etc and all that kind of stuff. i also was a bully, not an extreme bully like you might see on television but i definitely teased kids a lot, especially for being feminine or gay. all of my friends did it, and i definitely took part in that. 

&#x200b;

but the thing is, i was bisexual. i wouldn't call myself gay, because i definitely enjoy sex with girls, but not as much as men. i used to drive to nyc with my friend (who none of my school friends ever met) and go to gay bars and have sex with men. i had a fake id and everything to get into the bars. nobody knew i did this except my small group of friends in nyc, and they weren't even really my 'friends' in that sense, they were just sort of people i went to go find guys to hook up with in the village. 

&#x200b;

senior year, i got diagnosed with hiv. i knew i couldn't keep it a secret from my parents or anyone else. i decided to tell my parents that i had hiv, and i got it because i tried injecting heroin. of course, no track marks, but the excuse was that ""i only did it 4 times and then quit"". of course, i told my doctor that i got it from gay sex, but i told him to please keep this from my parents.

&#x200b;

my friends at school never suspected i was gay, they fully accepted the heroin excuse. it fit, very well, with my story up to that point. i had torn my acl and got painkillers, and they knew i was taking them, so i just lied and said i got addicted to them (i didn't, but i did take them recreationally sometimes and they knew that) and eventually decided to try heroin. i was also doing loads of other drugs, coke, pills, xanax etc so it wasn't totally out of the norm. my friends were obviously saddened, they thought i was going to die, but luckily i am still alive to this day. the weirdest thing is, even after my diagnosis, i continued to bully gay kids at my school. i was such an unbelievably shitty person even after this death defying change in my life. i didn't really fully come to terms with the fact that i was homosexual until my early 20s. i have never came out of the closet fully to my family or friends.

"i nibble on my father's cheeseburgers before serving them.. my father's health hasn't been great and i've been looking after him for the past year. he has grown fond of wendy's dave's single cheeseburgers during this time. i noticed that the square patty leaves four crispy corners of burger outside the bun. i have instituted a policy to eat these four protruding corners before giving the burger to my father and he is now convinced wendy's has switched to circular burger patties.

i'm not proud of this, but i do appreciate the numerous additonal nibbles of cheeseburger.

i have also inverted this tactic with his morning sausage patties, which are round. i will cut off the four edges with a spatula to dine on, so he is now also convinced that sausage patties are sold square instead of round.",11
"i have a great job, my mom adores me for all the help i give her, i crochet scarfs for the homeless. no one knows that i am an over the counter drug addict. not even my therapist.. for back round, i'm 25 years old. female. i work in a really great environment. it pays alright but overtime and bonuses help me get by mostly. i live with my mom and brother, not rent free though. i pay half the rent, buy food etc, pay me and my moms car insurance. i help her out alot. my dad was always in and out the picture. he was recently living with us but he left after a big fight he and my mom had. but even when living with her, he never helped out. my brother is 14 and the bright light in my life, he real life keeps me here, he keeps me sane. i love him with all my heart. he's so smart. gets all good reports from all his teachers. i help out a lot with him as well. my mom appreciates it very much. i don't have much, but i am so grateful for what i do have. my mom and i live in the projects, but its our home. we struggle at times but we make it work. i am currently saving up to get a place of my own though. though it will become harder i'm getting to that age where it's time to be on my own. i love to sew and crochet, in the winter of 2017 i began crocheting scarves and hats, before i was making them for babies, now i make them for adults. i live in ny. the city is a very big area for individuals in need. so every winter i go out there and hand them out. i get some nice reactions, then i get some good ones. overall, even though my life could be better, i am so thankful for everything i have.

when i was 24 i began taking sleeping pills, i noticed that they kinda fade me out especially at night when i cant sleep. before it was just to go to bed. i currently work monday to friday. my previous job i worked 12 hour days so i got 3 days off. after a few months i started buying more bottles of pills. i would take them as soon as i got off of work and in my car, by the time i got home around 8:30pm, i would shower then knock out. the next morning i would wake up around 10am, and i would take more pills. this went on for months. my mom became increasingly worried about me. thinking i was depressed because i would stay in my room all day. telling me i seem so withdrawn. i told her that i'm fine and work was just really busy. i do self harm but i stopped once i started taking the sleeping pills. idk, i just love how they fade me out, one minute im wide awake, the next minute im laying down struggling to keep my eyes open. i cant explain how that drowsy feeling feels so good. i am a hypocrite however.

&#x200b;

i dont smoke or drink. i don't however put on a facade that i'm some anti substance person. we all have our outlets for dealing with our shit. but i tell people that my outlets are crafts. painting, sewing, writing, reading. i mean, they help, but sleeping pills are much better. i pay 4 bucks for a 40 capsule bottle of a quick getaway. over the last year i have become increasingly dependent on them though. on my payday i'll go to 5 different stores just so i dont look suspicious buying a bunch of bottles at once. i can go through 2 bottles in 2 days. but i have also stopped cold turkey a few times. in october i took a whole bottle in the san of 12-14 hours and i wasn't tired, i couldn't see. even with my glasses on i was in bed looking at my phone waiting to get tired and everything became blurry. i ignored it but then i was falling in and out of sleep when i started seeing figures moving. it was really scary but i tried to ignore it. when that wasn't working i got up and my body felt like jello, its like my heart was beating manually, i couldn't talk without breathing in between each word.  noone was home thankfully so i went to the bathroom and tried to throw the pills up, it barley worked. that was the first time i was afraid for my life so i did call 911 and went to the hospital. 

&#x200b;

which turned out to be waste. i've been through this before (with a suicide attempt) taking sleeping pills and gashing my wrist wide open. i bled, so much, but i was still here. i sat in my car for an hour before i tried to clean myself up, it didn't work so i called 911 & told them what happened. the psych ward isn't fun. i knew that if i told the emt i took a bottle of sleeping pills i'd be on suicide watch so i lied and told the doctor that idk why my vision was blurry. this was a wakeup call for me and i stopped. but then i started again in mid november. i never considered myself an addict but now i realize how angry and irritable i am when i don't have any sleeping pills. and when i don't have any money i'll take pain killers in hope that i'll fade out. it doesn't work. i had 4.70 to my name after paying all the bills and i spent it on a store brand bottle of gel caplets. they only have 20 pills. so i've been up since 4am laying down staring at the ceiling and watching my hands tremor (happens after a binge). i can stop but i'll feel sad if i have too. not even have too. just not get that drowsy hard to stay awake feeling. it's my get away & as long as i go to work everyday and pay my bills, i don't feel like i'm hurting anyone. i know i'm hurting myself. but i just don't feel like i have a purpose in being here. 11 years strong going to therapy, 2 years strong being on zoloft for ptsd and anxiety. 

&#x200b;

i dont have a bad life, maybe not knowing what my path (dreamwise) contributes to feeling purposeless these days. i put on the mask of me being a positive happy genuine kind person, and i am! this is just my dirty little secret. i hide it so well. i know i have to stop eventually and i will. i'm just afraid that i wont find another vice to keep me out until then.


edit, sorry i don't mean to put the cliche wow i didn't think this would blow up but jeez, i'm at work right now but i read every. single. response. 

every single one. 

reddit is amazing. you're all amazing people, thank you for all your kind words and advice. it means the world to me. i was thinking about buying some sleeping pills after work but man screw that! i am however gonna stop at the store and get my brother some snacks for his sleepover later today♥️. i keep pictures of my parents and sister/brother on my wall. looking at them everyday keeps me moving. that love and everyday support really goes a long way. all the kind loving words on this post keep me going. i'm going to get my ass to a local and gym and look through some memberships. after reading some of the comments from former addicts/family members of addicts it's opened my eyes to the impact addiction can have on you and your loved ones. i don't wanna put my mom through that, i don't wanna put my brother thought that.


and also, i've smoked weed before, smoking just isn't my thing besides i don't wanna replace one substance with another (to all the comments about trying weed). and i take either advil or tylenol pm. tbh i don't read the mg amount, i just buy them. i have dozens of empty bottles in my bedroom that i'm gonna throw away when i get home later.



once again. thank you so much to everyone who took the time out of their day to spread such positive words of advice and well wishes. i care deeply so much for this kind of good hearted energy.

"i never paid for a parking permit for my university parking garage but i still parked in it every morning.. back when i was in college every morning i would illegally park in my schools most kush parking garage. i learned that when i park in a certain parking spot (the one closest to the stairs) and if i parked my car facing the wall, i would never get a ticket. the parking police for my university do their rounds while riding on mopeds or go carts. so knowing this i would put all these air freshener's on the mirror where students are supposed to hang their parking permit and from the vantage point of the parking police they wouldn't know if i had a permit or not unless they got up out of their cart and walked to the front of my car. the parking spot by the stairs is always the last car in the row. (and the parking police don't fuck with stairs because  mopeds+stairs = no bueno) chances are by the time they get to the end of the row they aren't likely to get off their ride just for the chance that my car would have a permit or not. in 3 semesters of parking in the garage i got 2 tickets which came out to 50 dollars each. a $100 ticket for 3 semesters vs an $800 parking permit per semester.  i think i'm alright with that.

"only my doctor knows i was a heroin addict for 3 years.. it all started with a major drinking problem. then the depression kicked in. i lost a mother to cancer. my closes friend he ended up being a con artist. then there was the stress of a very intense job. i couldn't sleep at night. work was really hard. i had no friends. i felt ugly, i was almost 250lb at 5'6. 
with nothing left in my heart and soul. i started doing heroin to try to kill my self. i was really hoping the first time would kill me. instead it just help me sleep. then it helped me with my drinking problem. 
back story on the drinking: i had be drinking between for about 20 years. i would drink from 6-10 beer almost every night of the week. 
then i was a junkie. 
after about 1 months of doing heroin every few nights to help me sleep. i started doing it every night. then after another month of that, i started doing it on my lunch breaks. i wanted to numb out everything that was going on with work and the lost of two very close people. i never hurt or stole or did anything harmful to anyone during my drug use. i went to work everyday in the pit of sadness and  a very harmful addiction. that was my life for two and a half years. 
then i lost my job: 
then i lost everything. 
my life was heroin. 
once everything was gone i went to the doctor. 
still at this point i never stole or hurt anyone. 
getting sober was the hardest thing i have ever done in my life. 
now i'm exactly one year sober. 
i still have nothing but a dream. 
i'm still not sleeping well. i still don't drink. i'm about 160lb. i will never do herion again. even if you put it in front of me. no matter what happens. i go to a shity job everyday that pays me nothing. all in hopes that one day i'll be able to buy a van and live on the road. this is my last four years confession.",11
"i pee'd all over my crush's bathroom floor. back when i was a young, smitten 13 year old girl, i was hanging out with a boy at his house, who i had a major crush on.

i was playing it cool, hanging out and having a laugh together, no kissing or anything happened at this point, it was still very early flirty stages.

anyway, at one point i had to use the bathroom so i went up the stairs and into the bathroom, you know, normal stuff.

well i have this fear of people hearing me pee, especially if it's someone i have a massive crush on. so i use this technique, where i kinda turn my body, and aim my pee directly onto the porcelain part of the toilet, so it doesn't make any splashing noises.

this was all going fine and dandy and there was no peeing noise to my relief. 

i stood up, ready to pull up my pants, and immediately my heart dropped. 

instead of aiming onto the porcelain, i had managed to somehow completely aim my pee directly onto the floor and all over the carpet under the toilet. 

i absolutely freaked out and tried to use as much toilet paper as i could to clean up the mess on the floor, but the carpet was still soaked, so i rinsed it under the tap as much as possible and squeezed all the liquid out. i didn't know what to do with the rug, so i just left it in the bath tub, hoping to get away with it. 

i went back downstairs to my crush and didn't say a word about what happened, but i was absolutely terrified his mum would come and ask wtf was going on with the carpet in the bathroom.

she never did and i felt the biggest sense of relief when i got home that night. 

moral of the story: who cares if people hear you pee.

"i got a classmate kicked out of an elementary school concert. sooo in elementary school we had these things called ""shares"" which were basically just concerts for our parents where we would stand on risers and sing songs.  for the veteran's day share, i was put on the back riser, second from the end.  the boy at the end of the riser was really annoying me.  i don't even really remember what he did, but he said something that made me snap.  this was during my braids phase, and my hair was long enough that i had a decent tool to work with.  i turned my head away from him and waited.  when the chorus teacher wasn't looking, i whipped him in the face with my braid as hard as i could.  it hit him so hard that he lost his balance and fell off the back riser.  now, he wasn't the best-behaved kid in the class, so he was already on thin ice with the teacher, but this was his final straw. she only saw him fall off the riser, so she assumed it was his fault and kicked him out of the share.  whoops.

"i lied about not being able to see, and completely ruined my vision.. when i was in the 3rd grade, i thought that people wearing glasses were super cool. they always seemed to be smarter and what i perceived to be more popular. i wanted to wear glasses, but i could see perfectly fine. so i lied.

when the annual in-school eye exam came around, i lied to the student nurse and my parents. i pretended that i was unable to read the test on the cards, even though i could see it perfectly fine. this earned me an appointment with the optometrist, where i lied, again, to her as well.

this landed me in my nice and shiny prescription glasses. i got what i wanted. i was a 3rd grader with glasses. cool like everyone else... and... uh... i played myself. turns out, wearing prescription glasses when you do not need them will totally ruin your vision - actually.

here i am, age 23. blind as a bat. still wear contacts or glasses to this day, eyesight progressively worsening, with astigmatism in both eyes.

i've never told anyone this, from 7 years old to 23.

edit: to all the reddit optometrists: you're absolutely right! and honestly, it made me feel better lol. i did real research (as opposed to casual, nonchalant) after i started seeing some of these comments. and you're right! more than likely, my lie had no real impact on what my vision ended up becoming. but that's fine! that doesn't make my confession any less real. me lying about something that ended up becoming true, doesn't make my lie any less real.

to all the people who claim this is a repost:  you're wrong! it's not a repost. look at the sheer number of comments of people saying they did the same thing or something similar. this is my honest post, and as you can tell by my profile, i don't use this app much. so i had no idea other people had shared their story too.

this was an honest confession. no matter how many ways you can twist it.

"i am 24 hours clean off heroin, but a couple weeks ago i picked up a 2 year chip in aa. only 1 person (besides my multitude dealers and some of the randos who go by their houses) even know that i was using. everyone in my normal life thinks i have been 100 percent clean and sober.  my main drugs of choice before i got clean were alcohol and heroin, although i would do anything you put in front of me. 

i got prescribed pills after a dental procedure, and, more than that, they actually gave me one while i was still in the office. i took it without really registering what it was in my weird/foggy headspace. later, i realized. i figured i had already broken my sobriety so fuck it. might as well get the prescription filled so i didn't have to be in pain. in less than a week i was scoring dope again. in less than a month i was up to a gram a day, then eventually 3. it was consuming my life, my money. it was getting hard to keep covered up, and i think some friends worried about me, but i also had several unrelated semi-tragedies occur during this span of using (about 6 months) and i blamed the weight loss and acne and general lack of well being on stress. 

strangely, i never used anything else during this relapse. i didn't even have a beer.... and i love me some ipas. 

the fact that no one knew made it hard to stop. i had to keep using to stay well to keep up appearances. if i got dope sick the truth would come tumbling out. i would lose my job. my family. my friends. my house (my roommate is sober, and would definitely not allow me to live with her if she found out i was using again). i didn't want to have to start over. so... i kept using and everything got worse and worse. 

until today. 

today... i'm clean. 

today... i have 24 hours. 

today... i fucking did it.  

and no one knows. 

and i can't celebrate it.

also, i don't know what i'll do about my sponsor, telling the truth about what happened that is, or anyone else in my life. maybe one day, but for now, i'm just gonna try to stay clean.

edit: first off, thank you all so much for the overwhelming support. it is helping me more than you know in a time when i feel so alone and so physically and mentally horrible. 

also, i couple people asked so i figured i'd just put it here. i lied (again) to my friends and family and said i was gonna go camping now that the weather is nice. i packed up all my camping gear and then parked my car at the airport parking garage (where i figured it was least likely to be seen by someone i know) and took the bus to a shitty hotel. 

i am taking baclofen, clonodine, and gabapentin. i also have phenobarbital for sleep and for day three (the worst day in my opinon) or whenever it gets too bad to stand. 

as a last ditch failsafe, i do have suboxen as well in case i get to the point where i'm about to go pick up.  buuuut i really don't want to take the subs if i can at all avoid it.  that's just taking off the gorilla off my back and replacing it with an angry chimp. but it would be better than using so... again, it's the final line of defense.

edit 2:

holy crap, i never expected this to get so much attention or such a huge outpouring of support. i want to (and eventually hopefully will) reply to all of your comments and messages, but right no my brain isn't working so great. in the meantime i just want to say a couple things to all of you. 

first, all of your support has been so moving and so helpful. yeah, i may be a little extra emotionally fragile right now because of the boat i'm in, but i have regardless spent a fair amount of time crying tears of joy. i never imagined that so many people would even acknowledge this, let alone be so genuinely and emphatically caring and invested in my struggle. it means more than any of you can imagine, truly...it does. i felt so alone and lost and scared, and you have given me exactly what i needed. from the bottom of my heart, thank you. you all have my unending humble gratitude. 

second, so many of you have asked, so i absolutely will provide updates as this goes along. i suppose just by editing this post?  unless there's a better way. i dunno. feel free to give me pointers in that department. i'm not thinking outside of the box well right now. 

third, rest assured i will come clean to my friends , family and everyone in the program. i'm gonna concentrate on detoxing first, and then i'll put on my big boy panties and start with my sponsor. for those of you who were wondering, i'm not keeping it secret in order to keep up my sobriety year number, it was more out of a necessity to keep my job, my house, etc. as far as coming clean goes, the real reason i want to do it is less out of a fear of easier relapse, and more out of a desire to show others in the rooms and seeking sobriety that one can come back from a relapse and get clean again... that it doesn't have to be the end of the line, or a reason to give up on getting clean. i want to be a means to help others achieve sobriety. 

fourth, as of right now it has been 45 hours since my last use, and dear god do i feel like shit. just typing out this edit has taken a few hours because i have been getting uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting, shaking all over, sweating like a pig, horrific stomach cramps, my legs feel like they're being constantly stabbed all over, and my joints feel like someone has a lighter to the inside of them, and that's not even mentioning the mental stuff, the anxiety and confusion. 

and lastly, i know it's spelled fiend. 😂 
i dunno, like i said my brain ain't braining so good right now. 

again, thank you thank you thank you for everything. i am just blown away and so touched. the only way i can repay y'all is by keeping at it and staying clean.


edit 3:

withdrawals are getting really bad now. i'm sorry but i'm just gonna knock myself out and try to update later, if anyone is still watching this that is. i'm gonna call my ""nurse"" from my dealers text and have her come watch/help me for a bit. in all honesty she's my ex. she also won't let me use. that's why i trust her to watch me. 

i'm craving pickles and honey.  i feel like i should be pregnant or so nothing. separately a mean. i don't want them both now at once. anyway i haven't ate since i stopped using and i hope this helps. just been drinking as much gatorade as i can, brought two big bags full of bottles.


edit yet again:  i am still sober. i made it through the worst parts without using the suboxen, and today is day 11.  i go back to work tomorrow. i'm feeling as close to normal as i think i'm gonna get for awhile. i'm still dealing with some post-acute withdrawal stuff, anxiety and depression, but i am doing much much better physically. i called my sponsor and told him i fucked up and i needed to talk big time. he'll be back in town this week and we'll meet up to talk at that point. 

i can't explain to you how hard this kick was. it gets worse and worse every time and i about lost my mind. until i have in and had someone come help me a bit the only thing getting me through was reading the kind and encouraging words from the people who commented on this thread and sent me messages and told me i was loved and cared for. i know that the rest of the fight still lies before me, but getting through this detox would have been impossible without y'all. i mean that. thank you for everything, reddit.",11

"i am an a-list celebrity who hates it. the only reason i haven't killed myself is my kids.. i wish i never had kids. i love them, they are the best things that ever happened to me, but i wish i never had them. they'll have to grow up in ""the life"" and i fear they'll never lead normal lives. you know how there are celebrities everyone loves? well i am a celebrity people generally hate.

i've never done anything bad or illegal, i work hard for my kids and lead a clean life. my husband is also an a-lister and we never get to see one another. everything i say is quoted in the media. i can't eat in public without a million paparazzi in my face. i cant sleep at night.

i have an anonymous facebook account and i follow posts on entertainment websites about myself, reading the hate comments and going into a depression. i don't know why i do it, i wish i didn't, it just feels like the world is against me. i've been called fat, i've been called dumb, i've seen comments with people saying they wish i killed myself. i have never done anything to harm anyone. i just want to fucking die, i fantasise about killing myself every day, and would have if it weren't for my kids.

everyone thinks i am bubbly and free, i just wish i could stay in a dark room all day and sleep. i feel constantly strained and close to tears. my family and friends are all either famous or living in inaccessible locations. everywhere i go i am followed by people screaming at me, paparazzi are scum suckers, they are the worst people in the world. it might seem like i am being harsh, but when you are tired or scared and you have a thousand cameras in your face and people demanding that you look at them and answer their questions, it hurts.

i went through a really hard time a while back and was fucking scared for my life, people said i was attention seeking. other celebrities i have met are the same, nobody in this industry is truly happy. i just want to fucking die i am going to breakdown any day now. i follow stories. people laughed at britney spears, but that shit happens for real in real life. robin williams killed himself, he must have been tortured. it's a shitty life, guys.

"i had sex with a famous musician when i was 16 and i hate myself for it. this has been on my mind for a while now. it's something that happened 10 years ago and i've kept it a secret along with my friend who also never told anyone about it but it's been making me feel depressed because i feel cheap and used the more i think on it. so yeah 10 years ago when i was 16 i went to a concert with a friend that was by a pretty big band, they were big in the 80's and still popular then so we were pretty excited to go. i'm not going to say who it was and i'm not really thinking of trying a lawsuit or anything i just want to talk about it and stop bottling it up inside. 

so we went to this show and it was awesome, the band were fucking amazing and we were in tears through most of the thing it was that good. this was the first proper concert i'd ever been too and the crowd and everything else was electric.  before the show we were at the front and got talking to one of the security guys and joking around so after we saw him again and we asked him if we can go backstage and get an autograph and maybe a picture. i'd bought something in the hopes of getting it signed so we took our chances asking, can't hurt right? so he kinda smiles and says he'll go ask somebody if it's okay, he talks to this guy who it turns out is their tour manager and he looks at us for a minute and then asks us what our names are and we tell him and i say i won't bother them for long i just want my record signed etc. he thinks for a second then asks if he can take a picture of us for the tour photos and we agree posing for it. he then says he'll be  right back and will go ask the band if they are okay with visitors backstage. 

we were really excited at this point because it looked good, we spent the time talking with the security guys about all the bands they've seen play the venue and the tour manager comes back a little time later and says he'll take us backstage giving us a pass. some others had shown up by then asking but he turned them away saying they can only accommodate us and that since we asked first he'll let us in. when we got backstage there were already women hanging around, they didn't really look like fans so we assumed maybe they are girlfriends or wives etc. the tour manager introduced us by name but nobody seemed too interested at first. after a little while they call us over and we talk to them. i'm super nervous and ask them to sign my record, they sign it and we talk about it and they tell us some stories about when they recorded it, we take some pictures and all seems great. 

the conversation slowly gets more personal, the bass player asks if i have a boyfriend and some questions about my sexual experience. i answer that i've not done much more than kiss a guy since i didn't really know what to do. i was scared that if i didn't answer they'd think i'm weird and kick me out or something. they seemed more talkative after that and invited us to sit next to them and made conversation. they asked if we'd come to their after party and we excitedly agreed thinking we were really cool because we were getting into a real after party with all these famous people. 

they left and we were taken in another car to their hotel and ushered into a back door and  into an elevator. the crew members took us to a room and let us in where the band guys and some others were hanging out. we hung out at first, they gave us alcohol and got us drunk, we just thought it was fun at first. they offered us pills and weed and we agreed to it all because we didn't want to say no. i started feeling lightheaded and like something bad was going to happen, i said i wanted to leave and tried to get my friend but a couple of the guys told me it'd be fine that they'd take me home when i sober up. they told me to lay down and ushered me to one of the beds. i remember really feeling out of it but i recall seeing my friend on a chair and one of the band kissing her and his hand was in her skirt. 

at that point i felt somebody touching me and he said it'd be okay because he'll be gentle. i tried to push him off but he kept pushing me down until i gave up fighting and just let him have sex with me. everything just went silent in my mind at this point, i knew what was happening to me and i knew somewhere they were doing the same to my friend but i just went to another place. after he was done they pretty much just took it in turns to have sex with me and my friend. after a couple of times i was sitting up and felt sick, somebody gave me some medicine and said it'd make me feel better and i just took it and tried to find my clothes stumbling around. they were laughing at me and somebody asked if i need a shower which i did. there was like a door between two rooms and one guy who i guess was one of their crew or something pulled me in the other room and said to use the shower there. he was commenting on how i have a nice body and as i got in the shower i got really dizzy and blanked out, i felt somebody get in there with me and i assume it was the same guy, he did stuff to me and i lose time there, i woke up in a bed naked and the crew guy was standing around on the phone, he hangs up then he told me to shower and get dressed which i felt like i was doing before i blanked. 

after i did he was waiting for me and grabbed my arm pulling me into the corridor. he asked somebody about another girl who turned out to be my friend and they said she's in another room. he knocks on this door and an older guy in his underwear answers and inside i see she's on the bed naked. he says to get her in the shower and dressed because he's getting rid of us. we wait for a while and i can barely stand because i still feel drunk and sick, she comes out looking confused and she's crying we hug and then the crew guy still has an attitude and tells us to move pushing us to get in the same elevator we came up in. we go out a door and into a car where he asks where we live. my friend said her address because she knew her parents weren't home and her older brother was at his girlfriend's place so we wouldn't get in trouble for staying out late. 

the guy dumps us a couple of blocks away and tells us to walk which we did. it was like 3\-4am when we got back i just showered again and went to sleep. i was really angry the next day and cried but just said it was nothing when my parents asked what's wrong. i just tried to bury it and forget for years after that and so did my friend. we never even spoke about it after that day we just agreed to forget it. some stuff triggered my memories recently and i keep having flashbacks to these guys all standing over me laughing while they hurt me. 

i guess they knew i was just another stupid teenage girl impressed with a little star power that they could manipulate and they took full advantage. i'm not even sure if everything that happened to me because i blanked for a long time. i don't know of anything that happened to my friend but she probably had a similar experience to me. i remember seeing older women at the hotel partying but nobody else our age. i wonder how many teenage girls this happened to, if they regularly invited some to take advantage of them and dump them after like garbage. i feel used and cheap for letting that happen to me.

"i reached out to the girl i bullied in school and apologized, and she forgave me.. this was one of the most gut wrenching things ive done in a while, i was so scared to even say anything to her because i was scared of having to face the consequences of what i did when i was younger.

but she forgave me, and told me she wanted to start crying when she saw my message because she didn't thing anyone would say sorry for how they treated her. i told her i didn't deserve her compassion or kindness and started crying as well.

we talked for a little bit, asking eachother what were doing now and what we plan on doing. i feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. i'm so grateful.

"i making my daughter move out of the house because she's acting like a prostitute.. i know that some people will think it's wrong but i don't know how else to handle this situation. ever since my first child was born i've done my best to create an open environment where my children able to talk to me about anything, free of judgement (for the most part). sex, drugs, alcohol, whatever. i wanted them to be able to come to me if they ever had a problem.

now to the point of the post: ever since my daughter started at university she has been sleeping around a lot. in the last year she has had sex with at least 13 different guys and that's just the one's that i know about. on top of that she often goes out to parties and doesn't come home until the next day so it's likely much more than that. i've tried to talk to her about it but she just tells me to stay out of her life and stop judging her. it came to a head yesterday morning when i went into her room to find her asleep in her bed, naked, with *two* guys. i've tried so hard to be tolerant of whatever she wants to do but i will not have my daughter acting this way; certainly not in my house. i told her to pack her bags and move out - i don't care where. maybe it makes me a bad dad but she is an adult now. if she wants to act this way then she can pay her own way.

"i laughed when a salesperson told me his son is severely disabled.. this one makes me cringe a lot. 

probably 4 years ago when i was 16, i was at a car dealership with my parents. they were in the process of purchasing a new car, and of course the car dealer was doing all the sweet talking to keep us lured in and to make a purchase that day.

just in a friendly way to be more personable, my parents and the salesman had switched to talking about travel and kids and more personal stuff. in response to something my parents had said, the salesman replied with ""i would love to do something like that with my son. it's tough though, he is 22 but has the brain capacity of a 3 year old"". i immediately thought he was joking, and just roasting his kid. like haha i have a stupid son. so of course i burst out laughing... it took about 2 seconds to realize i was the only one laughing and everyone was staring directly at me.

i still remember the look the salesman had on is face. the look of i want to strangle you right now... but making the sale is more important. my stomach flipped realizing i laughed at his child's severe developmental issues. woops. i just kept silent the rest of that conversation. 

but hey, we drove off the lot in a new car that day.",11
"i pretended to be sick for 2 months. i was like 10 when i pretended to be sick for about 2 months, i acted like i was throwing up and my parents spent hundreds of dollars on doctors visits and treatments not knowing it was fake and 5 years later they still don't know, but the kinda sad part is that the reason i faked sick for that long was to get out of school because i was being bullied constantly and would barely make it through the day, i have never told anyone this but i want to put it in here because i want to tell someone at least. i still feel bad about the money my parents wasted on my fake illness

"i irritated a furry porn site off the internet.. years ago, i had silly dreams about making a youtube career of showcasing abysmal porn stories and fan fiction, reading them with stupid voices, and providing commentary. it never happened, most of my videos topped out at 50 views, and it just wasn't very fun.

but, while that dream was at the forefront of thoughts, i discovered a website. it was a site designed for my little pony porno fan-fics. this was right around the time that show was popular with grown-ass adults. as an addendum, i will go to my grave insisting that bronies are just furries in denial.

anyway, the site was relatively small. no forums or actual accounts. you could comment under whatever name you wanted, and leave another comment three seconds later with a different name, and nobody would know. and, the most questionable site decision was that *anyone* could upload stories, and *anyone* could delete the stories that were already present. 

i decided to fuck with a couple entries. one i deleted outright, two had their original stories replaced with some single-line nonsense i thought was funny at the time. and i added two new stories myself, both of which were short, non-sexual, and totally irrelevant to cartoon horses. and that was where i intended to leave off...

until i saw their reaction the next day. people were *freaking the fuck out* over this incredibly small, easily-undone bit of vandalism. i saw comments about ""troll hackers"", massive comments deriding the site mods (as far as i knew, the site never had any mods) for ""policing our work"", and at least one guy going on tirades about how he couldn't believe that the site was ""being targeted"".

and i was weak. i couldn't resist. i deleted the story again, added more of own trash, and i added a comment claiming that ""this entry has been flagged for deletion as it goes against our policy. please do not re-upload it.""

the freakout escalated. people were rioting in the comments section. i jumped in, claiming that i was just a user this time, and that i stood firmly behind the mods. if they say a story should be taken down, by god, they had that right. and every time it was uploaded again, i deleted it and added more shitposts.

then, something wonderful happened. a miracle. other, totally genuine users on the site started assisting me. ""will you people follow the rules and stop uploading this fucking story?!"" they would post, as they went out of *their* way to delete it. people started impersonating each other in the comments, stories were being deleted left and right, actual trolls jumped in to fuck with the site their own way... it was a shitshow, and i was laughing my ass off at what i had done. 

and then one day, the site was gone. there was no warning, no explanation, it was just a dead link one day. i googled it, and there was almost no trace of it. except for a brand-new entry on some other pony-porn forum. ""does anybody know what happened to that site?"" and the answer nearly brought a tear of joy to my eye. ""i know it was having serious issues with coordinated trolling and harassment, so i'm pretty sure they shut it down.""

never in my wildest dreams did i imagine that the site would get nuked off the internet, all because of some minor vandalism on my end. first i laughed my ass off, then i felt kinda bad, then i laughed my ass off again. 

it was just an archive for terrible fan-fiction about cartoon horses fucking each other. there was no community aspect, not until i accidentally created a civil war in the comments. i'm sure i'll catch some flak from the ""furries are sacrosanct"" crowd, but that's why i posted this with an anonymous throwaway account. 

i accidentally murdered a terrible pony porn site nearly a decade ago. this is my confession.

i have no regrets.

edit: wow, my first silver, for a confession about furry porn on a throwaway account. my mother would be so proud.

"i poop with my blinds wide open so the douchebag lawyer next door can see in. i attempt to make direct eye contact while doing so as it is my way of establishing dominance.. his law firm and my house are about 5 feet apart from each other, and he has a habit of cussing out people on sight and calling the police on us for being on our porch (not at night, not being loud, just being out there with a beer in the middle of the day). 

so i do this, in full view of his clients and workers. sometimes i dramatically look over my shoulder in an attempt to make direct, stern eye contact as is a sort of symbolic ""i'm de captain now"" statement. 

edit: i severely underestimated how badly this would offend some people.

edit 2: okay, so just to address a few common criticisms here on a general level: 

1. ""queef"" is the pseudonym i've been using for the lawyer. he has violated numerous parking/easement agreements in the past under the guise that he is more knowledgeable of the law and can get away with it, he's had college kids cars towed within their legal times and used to park his car by literally ramming it into our house. our little feud began when he threatened to call the police on me for using his driveway for my bike twice a day, to which i said he should stop parking on our wall. he cussed me out and it's all spiraled downhill from there. 

2. we don't live in a party house, we really don't party much at all. we mostly just pull stupid legally-blurry hi-jinks to irritate him, as he has been an asshole to everyone that's lived in our house and on our block long before any of us lived there. our landlord has records of the police showing up to our house for old tenants who were literally doing nothing but being on their porch because he called, and the same has happened to me. he reported a false housing violation because the cops wouldn't come to arrest me for having a beer at the end of the day on my own balcony. an inspector came later that week and said all was fine. 

3. this confession (while very true, don't get me wrong) is clearly not something i take seriously. i am a full-time student with two jobs, no money and no time—i sincerely wish i had more time to dedicate to *pooping in front of my neighbor in a strange attempt to establish animalistic dominance*. if this goofy post on a lighthearted page by a dumb college kid about poop really offends you or gets under your skin, i really think you should try and laugh a little. 

4. i've definitely been more of an asshole in the comments on this post, so sorry about that. this goofy occurrence in my life is being taken way more seriously than even i have ever taken it which is why i am responding to various people with immature quips and really poorly written jokes. 

tl;dr: i'm kind of a dick, he's kind of a dick, relax and laugh at someone being dumb! ",11
"i've been tricking my friends into thinking they're getting high, but i actually give them cannabis with very little thc.. the placebo effect is incredible. 

i have epilepsy and a year ago i started using an alternative medication called ""charlotte's web"". it is a type of marijuana that has very little thc (the stuff that gets you high) and a lot of cbd (the medical stuff). they give it to children in an oil form. 

i consume it via a vape and do not get high. i purchase the charlotte's web and put a bit of it in a bag labeled ""king's kush"". sometimes when i'm with friends i offer them some king's kush (which is actually charlotte's web) **for free** and i pretend to be getting really relaxed within five minutes with just a couple of puffs.

the majority of my friends, even the ones who smoke recreational marijuana quite frequently, tend to start acting really relaxed when i give them the charlotte's web.

i told my girlfriend that we were trying one called the ""lover's leaf"" and that it was a well-known aphrodisiac. my girlfriend couldn't stop telling me how horny she was. **we did not have sex**. she told her best friend, and i gave her some (which was just charlotte's web). her best friend's boyfriend thanked me for that stuff.

a friend of mine recently got real king's kush and he told me that the high he was getting was different from my stuff, and he preferred mine. maybe the dispensary i went to had higher quality marijuana. i confessed to him that i'd always given him charlotte's web, which doesn't have enough get anyone high, but he couldn't accept that and insisted that my stuff definitely got him high. 

i'm probably going to keep telling my friends that it's king's kush. it makes them really happy.

clarification: i am not selling my friends marijuana. it's usually just me and some friends talking while i vape, then they ask if they can try it, then they act high. 

edit: from what i'm learning, i guess it's not entirely a placebo effect and it is a real relaxing high from the charlotte's web. however, i've tried other strains and those are definitely different highs. ",11
"i was a racist for a large portion of my teen life. i want to get this all out. thinking about how i acted, what i said privately and online then makes me want to vomit on the inside. i am not white. i am asian. even typing words about race makes me almost light headed. i was an introvert. i was a depressed asshole of a person and it made me feel better trashing other people for something they can't change. i apologize i do not wish to share the things i said, i can't even bring myself to typing without feeling weak. but then late high school years, i started to meet new  diverse people. i actually went out and made friends. i realized not everyone acted the same way and there are always going to be good and bad people. i know there might be more posts like mine but i just need to get mine out because i'm losing sleep over it. imagining if i said any of those things to my friends just fills me with dread. i'll never forgive myself for being like that but i'm going to move on. i'm going to change myself. thank you for whoever took the time to read this. god have mercy on me.",11
"i was so desperate to get high that i actually did jenkem. this drug is disgusting, truly and utterly vile. it is a mixture of fecal matter and urine, with a balloon on top to collect the fumes. the contents of the bottle are placed in the sun with the balloon on top until it fills up with excrement fumes. and then you inhale the contents of the balloon, which causes the effects. yes, it is real, and yes i did it. i was flat broke and utterly desperate to get high (admittedly i think i might have a problem). anyways, i began brewing the drug from my own excrement, and within several hours the balloon filled right up. i inhaled it...... and i honestly don't know how i didn't vomit. it instantly just made everything numb, and then i passed out.

woke up like 5 minutes later, and i was seriously fucked up. more like being extremely drunk, i was stumbling around, couldn't keep my balance, and felt dizzy as fuck. but also felt like my brain was basically ""glitching out"", no idea how else to explain it. it was kind of trippy honestly but not in a good way. more like a mild delirium, not like datura delirious but more like a sort of groggy, dreamlike out of it feeling, like being really, really tired. overall, i guess what could i expect, a shitty high from a literally shitty drug. not too surprising. i only used it once, about a week ago. and honestly, i still cannot get the smell out of my apartment. and my roommate recently moved in and is complaining about it. he thinks that the ""place might have a septic problem"", which it doesn't. but i just can't bring myself to admit to him what i did",11

anyways, there was this girl who used to bully all the time for no reason for like 3 years and i was obviously sick of it. so one time, i was bored at home when i thought of hacking (well, idk i should call it hacking) my bully's typing.com account, so i went in her account, went to a new lesson in the website and started typing all the words wrong while watching netflix. i did a 7 lessons and thought that it was enough... 2 weeks later, we were getting our typing grades and then i heard my bully complaining to the teacher that she did not deserve a d- in her grade. i watched satisfied when the teacher just ignored her.

i paint graffiti- not slurs, gang stuff and the mindless penises you see scrawled on things- more like the insanely colorful, cryptic you see adorning the sides of freight train cars. my ex knew about it and knew what my tag name was.

i mostly stuck to painting freight trains and occasionally walls and freeways but this time, i was so angry that i just took to the streets painting everything. i stayed mindful not to paint small family owned businesses and the like but literally everything else became fair game. i literally had a map of the city in my room, drew out quadrants and would take my bike or skateboard and blow through the area until the wee hours of the morning painting my tag on everything until i had space in just about every area of the city and my tag was ubiquitous throughout. roof tops, garage doors on side streets, bus stops- everything.

a few months later, i moved out of the city and to the other side of the country. my friends would send me pictures of my stuff when they came across it talking about how they couldn't go anywhere without seeing it.

then one day, i got a message from my ex that read: ""i literally see your tag everywhere i go. every time i try to stop thinking about what i did- i just get slapped in the face with another one that reminds me of you.""

eventually it led to her apologizing for what she did, confessing that the new guy she had been with ended up cheating on her and a myriad of other things that went wrong in her life. 

in all honesty, i have to admit, when that message appeared on my phone, it was one of the most satisfying feelings i've ever had. ",11
"i took a picture of my dead dad. so this is something i feel immensely horrible about and i don't know how to express this to people i know. it gives me a lot of guilt. using a throwaway because my main account has some personally identifying info.

my dad committed suicide early this year and i found his body when i went to visit him. it was a gunshot wound to the head. after i called 911, i stayed inside with his body and in the heat of the moment i snapped a picture of him laying there. the only person who has seen it is my sister. i look at it from time to time and take some odd comfort in seeing it i'm not sure how to explain...

i know i need to get rid of it, but i don't know how , and the guilt i feel from taking a picture of a dead fucking body haunts me , like it's so fucked up who does this. why would you do that.  i feel like he would be so upset with me for making this image of him permanent because when he would never want to be remembered this way. it feels almost disrespectful?

idk that's my confession.

edit : i haven't had the chance to respond to every comment but i have been reading them all. thank you guys so much , i needed to get this off my chest and i feel a little better about myself now. thanks for not berating me and putting me down honestly",11
"i tried to prove a point and killed a bird. a little back story. back in middle school my sister and i would walk home because it was a lot faster than the bus, we only lived about a mile away. and we both often wouldn't buy lunch so we would have a little extra cash. 

so one spring afternoon we were walking home and decided to grab a snack, cheddar fries were my choice. we opened our snacks and started to feed the seagulls as we walked by a pond. my sister said something along the lines that seagulls are dumb and i insisted to tell her they are relatively smart. to prove my point i told her if they were dumb they would swoop in to grab a fri if i threw it into a busy road. but seagulls being smart would just let it be until there was no traffic.  
so i throw the fri into the street and of corse a seagull comes diving in after it to retrieve the snack. bam. charles, the dead seagull we later named was hit by a car. the woman looked absolutely mortified and then the seagull cocked its head up for a moment then died. this has been a secret that has been kept between the three of us (me, my sister, and the driver) and we have never shared. 
moral of the story, seagulls are dumb and just want food. and don't throw food into traffic for birds. rip charles hope you live on in the subreddits. ",11

"i faked an allergy on my face to get my money back off an $80 skincare product due to no refund policy. so i bought an $80 skincare product. when i used it, it was pretty disappointing and didn't live up to its hype, nor did it do much to my skin. unlike the us, the country i live in do not provide refunds for beauty products which have been opened or used, you can only get your money back if you had an allergic reaction. my proof was my red rash and bumpy face after a laser hair removal. i took a photo of that and emailed customer service as 'proof'. i get to keep the product and i got my $80 back in a shady way and do not regret it, nor do i feel bad about it.

"remorse i called campus police on a party i wasn't invited to. my friends were having a party on campus but they didn't invite me. when i asked them about going they said i wouldn't talk to anyone and will be that one weird kid at the party. all that was true but it hurt hearing it from them. since they had the party on university property i called campus police and told them about the party. apparently, they had to been bored that night and went to the party to break it up. my friends were under 21 so they got in alot of trouble. i still feel bad to this day:(",11
"when i was a kid, i ""waved"" a car to go, and caused an accident. when i was a kid, i had to walk to and from school. one day, when i was leaving, traffic was backed up really bad (like usual) with all the people leaving school. this was a long residential street, with the school on one end, and a busy intersection on the other end. one of the residents of the street was trying to back out of his driveway, but was blocked in by all the traffic. i was walking by about this time, and one of the cars left him a gap to back out. i also stopped so he could go. he looked at me, as if he was seeking my blessing. i waved for him to go.

&#x200b;

now, what i meant was ""i'll wait, you can go"". but what he thought i meant was, ""back all the way out across both lanes without looking"". 

&#x200b;

so, he went charging out of his driveway in reverse. another car happened to be coming the other way, at a pretty good speed. that car swerved to miss the guy backing up, and consequently went down in the ditch, jumped a driveway and landed in a flower bed.

&#x200b;

the guy backing out gives me the ""wtf kid?!"" look, as if it was my fault.

&#x200b;

i must confess, i ran home and never walked on that street again. i'm sure, by running away it made it appear that i maliciously waved this person out into peril, but i didn't. hell, i couldn't even see the other lane. but whatever.",11
"i didn't pay federal income tax from 2003 to 2012. some of my family and close friends know that i have struggled financially. no one has any clue just how bad it was, how reckless and foolish i was, or how lucky i am to be where i am today. and nobody knows about the taxes at all.  here's my confession...

i started a small business in 1998, a single member llc, which meant the company's tax return was schedule c of my personal tax return. i never made quarterly tax payments but always had the money for taxes until april 15, 2003. i was about 30k short so i filed the return and paid what i could, planning to pay the balance over the next few months. but business was weak, and i drew too much for myself, and a year later i had not made any payments. plus i owed taxes again that i couldn't pay. i just submitted the return and no money at all.  i did the same in 2005.

in 2005 irs filed for a judgement against me and was awarded a tax lien for what i owed from fy 2002-2003, $116,000. irs took no action to seize my assets then or in subsequent years.

late in 2005 i got a golden opportunity. i took on a bunch of staff, and equipment that i signed notes on personally. money was flowing again. at tax time 2006 i had most of what i owed but i had invested heavily in the new line of business and decided to double-down, seeing millions in profits on the horizon to wipe out my debt. so i filed but didn't pay. 

by 2007 things were humming. i had leased bigger space, and increased staff again. at tax time however i was stunned by what i owed, more than $250k.  i filed and sent no money, rationalizing again that i'd be sitting on millions by 2008. irs had been sending me automatic semiannual tax statements since the judgement two years earlier but otherwise hadn't reached out to me at all, and though the amount owed was staggering i didn't feel huge pressure to pay.

then the recession hit, and more than 60% of my business disappeared overnight on september 29, 2008.

from 2008 to 2012 i tried to downsize and stay afloat but the company died a slow death. i filed tax returns but paid nothing. when i finally closed the doors i was sitting on $1.2m of tax debt, and hundreds of thousands in company debt i had personally guaranteed. i was also broke. at the end of 2012, i sold my only significant asset, a home, for a net gain of $150,000. the irs lien for $116,000 came off at the settlement table, but since there were no other judgments filed against me i walked away with $34,000.

in 2013 i started working for another company, earning a paycheck with normal tax deductions. i worried irs might come after my wages but they never did. in 2014 i filed a return and was actually due a small refund, but got a letter saying it had been applied to my tax debt. it was the same in 2015 and 2016.

while the irs wasn't coming after me, other creditors were, resulting in some judgments against me. but with no assets and living paycheck to paycheck, there was nothing to take and so no real repercussions.

in 2017 i filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. you can have tax debt more than 3 years old discharged, provided that returns were filed. by the end of the year all of my debt had been discharged, and the liens and judgments nullified. the total amount was nearly $2 million, including 1.2 to irs.

today i am living better than i have for a decade. i am renting a nice place and my only debt is a car loan for a new vehicle i just got. i actually have the best credit since 2009. you'd be surprised by how easy it is to get credit post-bankruptcy. i have money in the bank for emergencies for the first time in a few years, and i was recently promotes to gm where i work. 

a few more details you may be wondering about...  
-- i always paid state taxes. otherwise i would have lost licenses essential to operate the business.
-- i had accountants prepare the returns. i never e-filed. they would send them to me in hard copy with instructions and payment info. i signed and mailed the returns myself. i kept them mostly clueless about not paying.
-- this forum's rules prohibit posts about relationships. all of this had a big impact on those around me, obviously. it's been hard. can't say more.
-- i do feel remorse, but not really about the taxes.  i am embarrassed by my poor decisions and foolhardy optimism, and i am ashamed of all the small businesses who i owed money to but paid nothing. i am also extremely regrettful about how my actions impacted those closest me. i am very lucky to have made it to better times.
-- always file tax returns even if you don't include money due. if i hadn't i would probably be in jail.  owing taxes is a civil matter. not filing returns is a criminal offense.",11
"i stopped dating a guy because of his muslim faith.. both of us had some mutual friends due to an other friend of us being muslim, we met and he took an interest in me and we dated. 

i knew from the start he was muslim, i didn't cared much because im agnostic but i knew he had a really strict muslim family.

after two weeks his mom wanted me to meet them, at first i didn't really want to but i got along with it.

worst.decision.ever

while his siblings were really cool and nice, his mom and dad were living hells, i gotten dirty looks and they openly said that they were disappointed that their son didn't dated at least a muslim girl, my date said absolutely nothing because as he told me he can't argue with his parents, so i sat there and having them offending me in every slight way, my clothes,my hair,my make up.

it got even worse when they learned im agnostic which apparently meant atheist.

i avoided going to their home after that. i was also pretty pissed with my date who kinda agreed to some stuff, he is a big mama's boys.

it came to times that he commented about how my clothes were too revealing or how i should reconsider being agnostic.

he let his religion and his family get a lot into our almost relationship! 


so i broke up with him in a time of anger and told him about how he lets his faith and family ruin what we have and i couldn't put up with it, i even said that i wasn't going to be treated like an object like they do in saudi arabia. 

he pleaded to stay together and that he would change but i refused because inside me i knew it would be a hole in the water.

i regret for talking him harsh and after that avoiding him but i can't play along to please him. ",11
"i emulate social situations in my head instead of talking to people. i think i spend a good two to three hours everyday daydreaming about talking to people, imagining myself in situations where im happy, doing cool ass guitar riffs, etc. etc.

it kind of took a toll on my memory, often i cant remember if something actually happened or if i just tought about it

"bank accidentally gave me $500 extra at christmas. i'm from a tiny town in a southeastern us state. when i was in my late 20's, i had two very young children. me and my husband were broke, but managed to scrape together a little over $500 to spend at christmas. on everyone. that included each other, our little boys, parents, siblings, friends, etc. it was going to be a very slim holiday, but i was determined to make that relatively small amount of money work by doing a lot of homemade gifts and bargain shopping. 

i went to the bank to make a withdrawal, and right away noticed the teller was acting strangely and slurring her words. the whole ordeal distracted me so much that i pulled away from the drive-thru window and drove for several minutes before i realized i'd forgotten to count the money. i was nervous because i just knew that weird acting bank teller had messed up the transaction. 

i pulled over into a random parking lot to count it. imagine my surprise when i realized there was $1000 in my envelope instead of $500! i stared at the money for a while and really considered going back and making it right. i even started driving in that direction. i was raised to do the right thing. 

now this was a small-town, family-owned bank. the bank president was a woman who was just 4-5 years older than me and had inherited the position because her father spoiled her rotten. at the time i worked for a small business whose family kept huge deposits there. but somehow they overdrew their regular checking accounts regularly, and the business manager (who was a high school classmate with the bank president) would successfully get the fees waived all the time. huge ""good ol' boy"" and ""i'll scratch your back, you scratch mine"" network in that little town. i was definitely not in that ""network"".

a few months before me and the hubs had fallen on a rough patch and had overdrawn our accounts several times as well. to the tune of upwards of $200-300 in fees over a couple months!! during that time, i called the bank and   and pleaded with them to waive these overdraft fees. i knew it could be done because i'd seen it done for my employers many times. my begging escalated all the way up to the grown-up brat in the president's seat. she stood steadfast and refused to refund me those fees. i always knew the ""haves"" got treated better than the ""have-nots"", and this was now painfully evident. 

thinking of all this, and getting really pissed at the bank all over again, i turned around and drove home instead. i decided to hang onto the money for awhile to see if they'd notice it missing and call me. three days passed and they never called or questioned the transaction. i found out the next week from the local paper that the teller got busted for drug trafficking a ton of meth, cocaine, and just about every other illegal drug there was. she was likely high on the job. 

i kept the money. i think i spent every bit of the extra money on my kids. they got cool gifts like handheld gaming consoles and a powerwheels motorbike thingy. some nice sneakers and warm coats. and i don't feel a bit guilty to this day. 

tl;dr: a bank (with a high, drug-trafficking teller) who had treated me shitty in the past because i was a nobody, gave me $500 too much when i was broke at christmastime. i kept the money out of spite ,and my boys had a kick ass, magical christmas. the end.",11

"my son was in a car accident and it was my fault. remorse. little back story: i had kidney stones while pregnant and all that could be done for me was narcotic pain management. after he was born, the doctor didn't wean me off the meds i'd been on for months so i developed a habit. at the time i had a ""best friend"" who was a druggie, so she'd get me pills whenever i needed them. after a while, we both decided to get clean and get better. i was clean and knew she was trying to get clean too.

when my son was 5 months old, this ""best friend"" was babysitting him and borrowed one of our cars to run some errands. we got a call that she'd been in an accident on i65 and totaled the car - with our infant in the back seat.

come to find out, her ""errands"" were driving to a shady part of town to buy pills and snort whateverthefuck off a coffee table while my son was in his car seat beside her. when we got to the scene of the accident we had multiple witnesses tell us she was doing speeds of over 100, and appeared to be nodding off at the wheel. she rear-ended a family down from indiana on vacation. when we showed up, she was holding my son and the first thing she said was, ""they're already telling the police this was my fault, they're all liars, you know i'd never put him in danger."" i said, ""just give me my baby,"" then the police pulled her aside to talk. while getting our belongings out of the car, my husband found a needle in the front sear.

my son was fine; his car seat had been wiggled slightly sideways, but in an abundance of caution he was still taken by ambulance to vanderbilt children's. i cried the entire way.

my son could have died because i decided to keep a woman around that i thought was a friend. this was years ago and i haven't spoken to her since that day. i am 100% clean and sober now because of this, but i still feel such a tremendous guilt that i have nightmares, and i'm crying now as i type.",11
"i've anonymously reported my best friends girlfriend to social services. my best friend of 17 years is in a relationship with a toxic girl. i've been in a toxic relationship myself, and all the signs point toward her being exactly the same. she questions him, keeps tabs on him, is completely unreasonable, and more concerning, has struck him once, and cut her wrists in response to a fight. what's worse, is that she does this in the presence of her 3 year old daughter.
 
i'm going to list my reasons for concern here: 


• she smokes copious amounts of marijuana daily

• her daughter is fed a diet of takeaway food 

• her daughter is rarely put to bed before midnight 

• her daughter is always treated unfairly 


one day they broke up, she threatened to kill herself in her car, with her 3 year old daughter sat beside her. my friend rushed to the house to find her daughter in tears, scratch marks down her face. his girlfriend was sat on her bed with open cuts down her arms. for me, this was the final straw. i emailed social services and told them everything - as i was genuinely concerned for the safety of her child. 

yesterday my friend told me social services had been in contact, and that someone has reported his girlfriend. i'm terrified he's going to find out it was me that reported her...but at the same time, i have no regrets. this innocent 3 years old, is exposed to things she is far to young to see/hear, and she deserves a better upbringing.",11

**update**:

wow, i never expected this post to get this much attention. for those wanting an update, the talk went a bit better than i expected. i showed my parents pictures of my girlfriend and they were slightly disappointed. no yelling, no angry lectures like i expected. i can finally get good nights of sleep after months of insomnia stressing out over this. i'm so glad this is over.

the good parts:

1. they said they're willing to accept my girlfriend because although her skin is dark, her facial features look more like a white girl than black. i know it's really racist, but at this point, i'm just so glad they're willing to accept her, i'm not gonna argue or make any comment to them about this.

2. they're happy that she's a pharmacist. so career wise, it's another +1. 

3. they think she's actually pretty good looking, minus the dark skin obviously. again, if any of this was said by anyone besides my parents, whom i'm desperately trying to convince to accept my girlfriend, i would not be so accepting.

4. i will be bringing her to meet my parents the day after tomorrow, this sunday. i can't wait for this to happen. i've been dreaming about this day for a long time.

the bad:

this one was kinda my fault, they're not happy with the fact that i kept her a secret from them for 2 years. i did not tell them we're getting married in 3 months, i figured it's a little too much to take all at once, so i'll let them know in a month or so.",11
"conflicted i am sex worker and i have alot to confess. i am sex worker and i have alot to confess

long post


i am an escort who lives in a legal location for prostitution. i have been thinking about how people view my profession and how it makes me feel among other things.




 i was reading a comment on a post the other day and i felt awful about it.
the comment was along the lines of how most girls wouldn't date a guy who has been with an escort. it made me feel that people view escorts as non human/objects.






 which honestly i'm used to. i've actually wanted to post to roast me stating i am an escort just to see if i am truly desensitized to all of the derogatory names.






the profession i am in is so much more than what it appears to be. i've substantially helped many clients with anxiety, lonliness, depression, emptiness etc. its been statistically proven that areas with access to sex workers have lower rates of suicide/homicide. at times i feel like i am a sexual therapist. i listen to these men, actually listen. it feels like a slap in the face when most people talk about "" hookers"" as objects/ gross/addicts/have daddy issues etc.  (the one thing i will admit that is stereotypical is i'm a self identified sex addict.)





 yes, some clients are only seeking something they can't fulfill outside of their relationships, but even then, i can't tell you how many times i have sat down with a client and gave them advice on how to better connect and restore their relationship. 




i've also been feeling lately that i view men and relationships so much differently now. i used be a jealous and controlling person in relationships. i am introverted by nature so when i would find someone i connected with i would put all of my energy into them and get possessive out of fear that my relationship could be jeopardized by another person. i eventually decided being alone and fixing myself was for the best.





 and now being a single provider i look at the whole idea of relationships differently. i just see people as timebombs. waiting to get bored, stagnant, resentful of one another, growing apart. it looks like a heartache.




 i also have become jaded and find men untrustworthy. (yea i know, it's fucked up to generalize a whole gender) i've met so many men who sneak around instead of being honest with their partner. and even though this is my profession i still root for them to no longer need me and fix their relationship. i fear because of being a sex worker i have been tainted to the idea of love and honesty. 





and there's times when i have no one to talk to about how i feel. how encounters with certain clients leave me emotionally bankrupt because their energy was so dark. which i guess led me to posting a confession. i don't know, i'm kind of rambling now. but there's still so much more i could vent about! i've realized in this profession there's never one way to look at everything and i'm always contradicting myself with how i feel.





all in all though i do enjoy my work. i like making people happy and helping their mental health even if it's frowned upon.


sorry if this is jumbled and hard to understand, i wrote it quickly just to vent.",11
"i sleep on a stolen mattress every night. (apparently i need at least fifty characters in the title so i just put this here). i go to college in california, and it's pretty expensive here, like most of the u.s. my tuition is $20,000 a year, and that's without housing and food. so, when you go to school here, you expect to get your money's worth considering the cost. i came in as a transfer last year, and signed up to live in the transfer housing community, which was a set of nice apartments on campus dedicated to transfers. well, what happened last year was the school accepted too many students, mainly freshmen, so they placed as many freshmen as they could in dorms, and then put the rest of them in the transfer community housing. that created an issue for some of the transfer students, such as myself, as the school had nowhere to put them. we got placed in ""temporary housing,"" which was condemned housing in an unsafe area across the freeway from the school. it was due to be torn down in march, so the school was trying to place people in housing asap. these apartments were only 625 square feet with four people in each one, and were super run down. the school didn't give us a discount or anything while i was living there, and charged us the same amount that they would have if we had been living in the nice apartments they promised us. it was ridiculous, and 1300 a month for this place, per person. so 5600 a month total, which is insane even for california. basically, the school started putting the left-over transfers wherever they could. some got placed in freshmen dorms, and i was not about to live in a dorm again, especially after being promised something better. the school still didn't have enough space, and they offered students a bribe to cancel their housing contracts and find somewhere else to live. i found a girl who was in the same situation and we found a place together and took the school's money, which was a pretty good amount, although not as much as they should have offered to be honest. so, her apartment was fully furnished, because the people who lived there before left all their furniture and everything. most apartments were barely furnished at all and filled with furniture that the school rented. so my friend's apartment had all this nice furniture from ikea, including a table, couch, five paintings, a really nice small cabinet, a coffee table, and a side table. also, the people in the apartment across from her moved out and didn't lock the door, so there was that place too. we took almost everything from her apartment, including four chairs from the apartment across from hers. we were able to furnish our entire new apartment that we got together and used the paintings to decorate. we also took two desk chairs from my apartment and two mattresses. the school never said anything. my dad even helped us. he brought down the suv and we went back and forth from the old apartments to our new one. so yeah basically my first bonding experience with my roommate was looting an apartment. we found some housemates and stuff too, and they got lucky because they didn't have to provide any furniture. we probably got over $1200 worth of furniture from those apartments. we didn't take the couch though, as there was no space, but we now live in a very nice apartment right across the street from where our old apartments used to be. they've been demolished now. before they did that we saw moving trucks going over there and people loading all the furniture the school rented onto them, but no one ever contacted us about what we took. the desk chairs and mattresses belonged to the school, but we took them anyways. so yeah, that's why i sleep on a stolen mattress every night. considering how much we get ripped off as students, it really was worth it, no regrets.",11

"charged nearly $1,000 on my parents credit as a kid on a game.. i was around 11 years old. the game was arcane legends. it was honestly a pay to win game. you could grind for hours every day and play for months and still not even have a character that was as close to as good as a character you could have if you spent real money on the game. me being a kid and being absolutely addicted to this game, i decided it would be a great idea to take my parents credit card one day and sneakily put all of the information into my ipad so i could make the purchases. i came home from school and sat in the car thinking about whether or not i was really going to do this. i really wanted a special set of armor inside of the game so i could be as good as others. i said fuck it. i went into my house and without looking back i charged $950 to my moms credit card. i knew what i was doing was bad but i had convinced myself i had to do it no matter the consequences. i bought the $100 pack of diamonds 9 times, and 1 $50 pack once. the game had a cool down mechanism set up for in game purchases. so after i bought one pack for $100 i had to wait about a minute before i could do it again. so basically i sat on my couch for about 10 minutes charging hundreds of dollars to my moms card. i knew i had fucked up but i didn't even care because 11 year old me got the mythical armor set i had wanted for so long. 

obviously my parents found out within that same day as i had just charged their card $1,000. they saw that the purchases were made on a game and they knew it was me. so i tried to lie myself out of it and tell them how i must have accidentally hit the purchase button without noticing it. i was too ashamed to fully admit what i had done. my parents charged all the money back, and they got it. my account on arcane legends got banned because i still had the armor in game but the money got charged back so it was like i got it for free. i cried because i had put months into this game and it was all gone. i regretted doing this directly after. i eventually started a new account on the game and started to get a good character again, but ultimately i got bored and stopped playing.

tl;dr 

used my parents credit card without them knowing to spend $950 on a game called arcane legends to get some armor. parents found out and charged the money back, then my account got banned on the game anyway.",11

"i forged my way through grade 11 physics.. so i've always been a good student, like high 90s. i was doing well in 11th grade physics, but got an 80 on a test which severely impacted my average. we weren't allowed to take tests home, so i snuck into the teacher's desk at lunch and grabbed mine, i scanned it and created a blank test using photoshop. then, i filled it out more or less properly and then matched the teacher's handwriting as best as i could and marked everything correct, but then wrote a wrong total on the front. i then asked to see the test the next day. i pointed out that there was an adding error. she apologized and corrected it, i then had a 98 ( can't be too good). this worked so well i did it on another 2 tests and even on the final before she entered the marks. probably wouldn't do it again, but it did work.

edit:

wow, this blew up!
so story is a bit embellished. it was only a drastic change on the first one, the later tests was a difference of 2 or 3 percent (95 to 97/98). the teacher kept tests in a filing cabinet where each student had a folder with their tests. i asked to see my tests and just put the folder back hoping she wouldn't notice a test was missing. i then asked to see it again when we had class after lunch and just put the test back into the folder and pointed out the mistake. in all seriousness, i probably deserved a mark like 2 percent lower, but oh well. i also don't condone this, some teachers might be more attentive in terms of their handwriting. i mostly was just curious if it would work, didn't really need the extra percentage. i also don't know how to use photoshop, i used paint.net.",11

"i spent several years hiding sugar packets in my colleagues pockets.. at my last job i spent several years hiding sugar packets in my colleagues coat pockets. it started with just one colleague that i enjoyed winding up in good humour, but i didn't want it to be obvious that it was me. so i scaled up.

our coffee making facilities and coat stand were isolated from the main office, there were no cameras and some double doors that always provided warning of interruptions (some sort of air pressure movement would make the other jolt when one was opened). so i was never caught or worried someone might walk in and think i was stealing.

i must of done it twice a week for maybe three years and i'd pick random or decorative coat pockets. the type that people never really use. this was in order to maximise the confusion and unusual times the sugar packets would be discovered. i had maybe 40 colleagues and would make every effort to alternate targets. 

in this way i hoped none would ever tell another colleague that once every few months they randomly fact found sugar packets. who would??? your colleagues would think you were weird right!?

anyway, i particularly enjoyed putting them in the ceo's coat. he was a nice guy, but a bit disorganised and scatty. 

no one ever mentioned it to me, so i guess it worked, but i guess it also stopped when i left. so maybe they figured it out.

"i threw up in the public bathroom and didn't clean it up.. i got home from a party cross faded to shit and knew at some point i was going to puke. i preemptively went to the dorm bathrooms, which in my building is a public space for everyone on the floor. i guess my aim was off on account of my vision looking like i had just spun around in an office chair for 20 minutes straight because i got maybe 20% of it in the bowl and the rest went onto the back of the toilet, the wall, and the floor in the next stall over. 

i figured i was too fucked up to clean it at that point, but the next day when i went back i decided i wasn't drunk enough to deal with the mess and left it. the custodians don't work over the weekend so it sat there for a day and a half before it got cleaned up. when the custodian who cleaned it was finished she told me i had to wrangle in the freshman (because she had known me from last year) so that it wouldn't happen again. i didn't tell her it was me.",11

 it was really easy using a usb keylogger, i only hacked the professors that were really bad at explaining stuff and did not deserve to even teach. from time to time i would help fellow students, but they never knew how i got the tests, they just thought that i got them from other students that have already taken the tests.

got into their email because they would send their tests to be printed by a printing department and i would intercept them.

"i convinced my parents to get a divorce. so my parents had been ""married"" for 18 years before they got divorced back in 2012. i was 15 or 16 at the time.

i put ""married"" in quotes because even though the purpose of getting married is to basically solidify your love with someone, they were definitely not in love. at least, not anymore.

i remember my parents getting along well when i was young (around 3) but a few years  after my brother was born, things took a turn for the worst.

they were constantly at each other's throats. they would argue with each other every. single. night. my brother and i were terrified that something bad would happen during these arguments.

then, when they weren't arguing with each other, they were taking their anger out on us. my dad was just abusive and would go out of his way to find reasons to beat my brother and i with coat hangers until they broke.

and my mom was just reacting to the frustration. she would sometimes smack us, but that was the extent of it.

eventually, at the age of 15,  i decided that i had had enough. i was sick of all of this physical and emotional abuse. everyone in the household was hurting.

so i suggested divorce to my parents and talked about it constantly when the other parent wasn't around.

so eventually my ""manipulation"" worked and they got divorced. and honestly? it was the most liberating feeling ever. 

i don't know if i was in the right for doing this; i sometimes feel like a manipulative bitch when i think back to it. but overall my mom, my brother, and myself all seem like we've thrived without the constant presence of my dad.

here is where i get pissed off: literally everyone in the community rushed to form a search party and is obsessively ""sending prayers for her"" and giving donations to her family. why? she did literally the same thing that that ""affluenza teen"" ethan couch did and we all hate him for it! she sounds like a really shitty person to do what she did. she abandoned her critically injured friends and seriously injured family in the other car, and took off running from an accident she caused while drunk just to avoid being in trouble. fuck this girl. i don't feel like she deserves all our donations and ""love and support"" it just seems ridiculous to me. 

when we see a black teenager on the news that gets shot while stealing candy or something, and people say ""well they shouldn't have been breaking the law and they wouldn't have been killed"" but suddenly this girl gets trashed drunk and drives into a car with a family inside, peaces out from the accident scene and we should all be sending her money and ""praying for her safe return?"" absolutely not.

i decided to head over to the washroom and one thing led to another so i decided to start masturbating. 

i was wearing a short dress so all i did was take my underwear off, seat myself and go at it. i thought i had locked the door but turns out i hadn't. thought the knob thing turned all the way but i guess it didn't lock it. 

worst part? the toilet itself faces the door, so her little brother opened it up and saw everything because i had my legs spread on either side of the toilet. the door doesn't creak at all so i pretty much hadn't noticed until the door hit the door stopper and made a noise. so the little dude probably saw a good (almost) 10 seconds of me just going at it. 

obviously at that point i had stopped and talked with him for a minute and not to say anything. we had dinner afterwards. he stared at me. i stared at him. and every time someone asked him something or asked him what's new with him, i was shaking.  

i don't think i can go over to her house without having the awkwardness from knowing that her brother isn't forgetting this anytime soon. i've gone there some times after and once, the dude even reminded me to lock the door ffs. 

1) always lock the door and if you're going to masturbate, do it at your own house.

"my wife's face has kept me from killing myself and she has no idea. since i was 16 years old i have wanted to end my life and have gotten very close on a few occasions. i got married at 21 to a woman i dated for about 7 months. i knew she was the one after the first date.

fast forward to now, 4 years later and i constantly think about ending my life. i will be driving and really consider driving off a cliff or into oncoming traffic or i get home from work and want to hang myself in the garage. i told her i sold my gun because i didn't have a practical use for it even though i did it so i wouldn't use it on myself.

i keep a picture of my wife in my wallet. it isn't a wedding picture or anything special it is just a normal picture of her outside of a movie theater i took when she wasn't paying attention. she is so beautiful and i love her 100 times more then i love myself and the thought of her having to go through me ending my life is enough to keep me from actually doing it. looking at her face makes me immediately reconsider it and always stops me from doing it.

i don't think i can ever tell her this and nobody knows i struggle with this so it feels really good to tell someone. even if they are strangers. thanks for reading and taylor if you read this somehow just know you are an incredible human being and i am in love with you

update 1: wow i am really amazed by all the responses i got. i just needed to put this somewhere and am overwhelmed with the amount of love and support i got. i have officially decided i am going to tell her tonight after work. i haven't really thought about what i am going to say but i will figure it out as i go. i don't think i have ever had this much support in my entire life, even if they are strangers and it helps a lot more then any of you probably think. i will post another update on what she says after i tell her this

update 2: i told her over the weekend although it took me until sunday to do it. she took it much better then expected although said it definitely blind sided her. she wants me to go to counseling with her and talk it out with someone. we are still discussing that, but when i thought this woman couldn't get any more amazing she comes out completely understanding and is staying by my side. i feel like the biggest weight has been lifted from my shoulders and i just want to thank all of you for giving me the courage to do what i should of done a long time ago.

"i anonymously called my boss in the middle of the night for almost a year.. i guess with age i feel a little bit bad about this now. 

where i used to work i was on 3rd shift as a salaried supervisor. when i was off work and trying to sleep or relax i was constantly getting work related calls and texts from the other shifts including my boss. i was carrying the whole department basically. 

i loved what i did but i didn't feel i was getting paid nearly enough so after a year or so i started getting sick of never really being off work. 

my boss had a company paid cell phone and as a manager he was required to keep it on at all times in case there was en emergency at work.

during this time i had an old prepaid phone that was still active with carryover minutes. one night when we were slow at work i used *67, which blocks your number from being displayed, to call his phone and wake him up at 3:00 am. when he sleepily said hello i hung up. i planned on it being a one time thing but when he came in the next morning he was red eyed and exhausted like i was all the time from being called when off work. 

from that point on i would call him in the middle of the night two or three times per week. most of the time i would let it ring three or four times and hang up. sometimes i would call him from my real phone and pretend i ""butt dialed"" him. on the days i would call him when he was sleeping he would drag in looking rough and i would take secret pleasure in seeing him feel like i did since i was still constantly being called when i was off. 

occasionally he would comment that some ""damn asshole"" called his phone and woke him up. after about a year they hired another supervisor so my work was cut in half. i finally got some time to relax and get some rest. i stopped calling him at that point after almost a year. 

sometimes i'm torn between feeling bad about doing it and also that maybe i should have done it more.

"as a caddie, i once stole money from an older gentleman. i worked as a caddie and fore caddie for about 1 month of a summer when i was \~15.  i got booked as a fore caddie for a group of 4 older gentleman (probably late 60s).  after the round, the one who was the member of the club said to me ""good job today.  i'll go get my wallet from the locker room to pay you"".  

in the meantime, his buddies came up and said ""thanks for your help today"" and handed me $60.  i said thank you and went to leave.  on my way out, i ran into the member who yelled out to me and handed me $40.  i didn't tell him  that his buddies already took care of it, so i walked off with $100.  i never went back there again.

i know he is rich and $40 is nothing, but i still feel bad about it.  they were a nice group of guys to work for.  this was 15 years ago and i still think about him.",11
"my first daughter isn't mine biologically and nobody in my family knows. i'm sorry but this is a long read. while i was in college i was paired with a very peculiar roomate. she didn't talk to me much and would always be away, she was very clean and organized and i thanked the heavens for it because all my friends complained about their roomates and i had gotten lucky.

jump to two years later, she comes up to me to say that she's pregnant and may need some help from me. i asked who was the father but she said it was a random guy she hooked up with and she couldn't even find him anymore. when i asked about her family she said that she didn't have one, her entire family was dead and she had been on foster homes most of her life and only got out because she wasn't underage anymore.

after that talk she didn't say anything else. i noticed that she had strange patterns, she would wake up and leave super early and get back super late. the only times she asked me for my help while pregnant was when she went to discover the sex of the baby and to accompany her to one appointment who was a bit away from campus.

even then we didn't talk much. she kept her routine and i kept mine. sure she was pregnant but she acted like she wasn't and to be honest there wasn't much i could do anyway. she didn't slow down even when she got near her the end of the pregnancy and i'm sure this played a huge part on how things ended.

she was 7 months pregnant and asked me to take her to the doctor because she was feeling a lot of pain. she was weird during the entire ride, talking nonsense. she said she wanted me to care for the baby and to never tell the baby about her. at this point i was freaking out, this wasn't supposed to happen, so i was just agreeing to whatever she was saying.

when we got to the hospital they took her straight to be examined and later to have a c-section. apparently she had preeclampsia and her placenta was detached. at this point i called a few friends of mine because i was freaking out. the doctors gave me some medicine because my blood pressure was very high and i was having a panic attack. i don't remember that part but that's what they told my friends when they got there. 

later i learned that my roomate had died because of the birth but the kid was alive. they said that they had found a note on her belongings saying that i was the one who was supposed to care for the kid because she had no one else and didn't want her daughter to be raised by strangers like she was. 

i was so confused at the time, they said they would have to contact child services and i would have to file for adoption. this was at a weird time or maybe the city was just messed up, because they only checked my background and if i had a job and a place to fall back on and that was that. they just gave me a baby and didn't think twice about it because apparently the note that the roomate had left was a big thing and should be taken into account.

they gave me the note to read and i wasn't supposed to ever tell the kid about her real mom. after a lot of time thinking i came up with the idea to investigate her alongside my friends, which wasn't much since we were a bunch of idiots in college with not a lot of money. we could only find out that she was a sex worker and that nobody knew her much around college aside from a girl who was also a sex worker and gave us the info.

my friends told me to make up a pregnancy and have my parents care for the kid while i was in college. i'm not sure my parents ever bought the whole story but they did love the kid and accepted to care for her. the story was basically me getting pregnant on accident and not telling them because i was ashamed but coming back around because i realized that i needed help.

19 years later i'm married with two kids who are mine and my daughter who is mine but not by blood. i love all of them equally, i learned a lot after i graduated and had to care for her with the help of my parents. she is a bright kid and looks a lot like her mother, which makes me sad sometimes. she even says that we don't look alike and i tell her she took after her ""father"". i really wish i could tell her the truth. i feel so bad not doing it. i don't want her mother to be forgotten, especially by her own daughter.

"i sometimes id women to give them a boost.. i'm working part-time in a shop, and it's okay. a job i suppose. i get on with people easy and i do my job well enough. the only thing that seems to really make someone's day is when i ask women (30s to 40s) for id. if they say ""i'm (insert age over 30)"" i just tell them i have to if i think they are 25 or under. seems to really make them smile.

"i drugged a co-worker and he can't tell anyone. i (legally) take a stimulant for a medical issue. i'm very open about my mental health and medication with co-workers and friends because i believe it's the only way to help others seek help for themselves sometimes. now with saying that, there are always people who are nefariously trying to convince me to give them a pill or two because ""what if it helps them"". i always tell them to talk to their doctor if they truly believe they have a disorder.

so there is one co-worker of mine who (not so subtly) jokes about me handing him some of my medication at work every now and then. i've always shut him down in a joking way, but we both know neither of us are actually joking. it's never really been a huge problem, just slightly annoying, and i didn't think much of it until last week. from here on i'll refer to this co-worker as w.

now, i usually keep my things out in my car since i don't have an office or locker to safely store them. this one particular day though, it was getting pretty hot outside (yay for summer) and i had complained to a few co-workers at lunch about my laptop possibly overheating in my car. everyone else agreed it was shitty of management to not provide lockers and we all laughed it off. everyone except w.

w kinda piped up amidst the discussion and said ""you know, you can totally put your stuff in my office if you'd like, you know, so your computer is safe."" i thanked him and continued on my way. it didn't really occur to me at that time that he had any other motive other than being nice.

about an hour later, w saw me in passing and said, ""hey! i thought you were going to store your things in my office?"" it was at that moment i started seeing the big picture. so i smiled and agreed, ""yup! sorry, i just got busy! i'll go grab my bag and bring it up in a minute!""

so i went to my car, gathered my things and kinda sat there for a second in the sweltering heat of my car thinking. i would never accuse someone of stealing and generally expect the best out of people at my workplace, but it didn't sit right with me that w brought the whole situation up again and hour later when i had just made a quick comment that one time. i decided to take my meds out of my bag and store them in the center console. well, i took the stimulants out. what most people don't know is that i'm also prescribed an anti-anxiety medication, but i don't usually talk about it because i rarely take it. it mostly makes me sleepy and doesn't help throughout the day, only at night on rare occasions. the pills also look very similar to my stimulants. i kept that bottle in the bag.

for clarification, i did not switch pills or bottles, the anti-anxiety meds clearly state what it is. i did, however, have a sneaking suspicion that w had something in mind other than allowing me to safely store my belongings in his office, and was curious if he'd actually try to take one.

i ended up putting my stuff down in his office (he looked almost too happy to help), thanked him again and went about my business. maybe another hour later i returned to grab something from my bag and w had a look on his face that screamed i fucked up. he mentioned that he was not feeling well and his eyes were kinda droopy. he went home early that day.

now i know it was kinda fucked up of me to bait him like i did, but if he was a smart thief, he'd have read the bottle. and if he was a good person, he wouldn't have touched my shit in the first place. i counted the pills when i got home and sure enough 2 were missing. two pills. just one of those bad boys puts me on my ass. i have no idea if he took one and saved one or if he took both, but i know the look of sedation when i see it.

in the end, w was fine. he came to work the next day looking guilty af and mostly avoided me. we both know what he did, but he can't say anything without confessing to stealing my medication. all in all, i feel like he might have learned his lesson, though i do feel bad for setting it up. he hasn't said a word about my meds this week and i still don't have somewhere safe to put my things this summer, but i'm sure w got a fan-fucking-tastic nights sleep that day.",11
"i stole $45,000 from my former employer and think i am morally justified. i read the other posts about people taking money out of the tills and thought i could do better than that. so no one knows this but i used to work for a bank (i assume no one is going to have sympathy for these guys) for several years. i won't say where or which one. towards the end i was essentially redundant but they refused to pay me out and instead insisted on keeping me and proceeded to try to bully me into quitting. i have mental health problems and this began a mental breakdown for myself. i used all my sick leave and they refused further leave, i got the union involved but they are piss weak. eventually got some leave entitlements plus a little extra with an agreement not to sue, \~$30,000. this was about $45,000 less than what my redundancy should've been at the time. being mentally fragile i accepted as i didn't have the capacity or support to fight for my rights (i would have had a very strong legal case).

so as you do when you're a bit down you have some erratic and destructive thinking. in the bank i worked in credit, fraud and collections among other things so i knew all the holes in the systems... a few phoney applications later i managed to get i estimate maybe $45,000 not including costs out of them. i won't say how because it was very specific to the organisation but had to get the money in actual products not cash so i then formed a business to turn the products into cash.

i made a few mistakes along the way but i know financial crime is never investigated and i made sure that there was nothing linking the applications together so they wouldn't even know it was one person.

another plus was it made me very very happy doing this. win win. i don't feel guilty in the slightest. i think i actually went pretty easy on them.

tl:dr scammed my ex employer out of my rightful entitlements.",11
"i told my school my mom died in afghanistan. she then did a surprise visit on leave to the school.. back story to this, my parents split up weeks before she was deployed back in 2004. i at the time blamed her based on her actions following the family break up. she even remarried before she left the states. i refused to talk to her, i was 11 at the time. i was so angry i eventually started telling people in my school my mom died. it was mainly in response to people asking me of my personal life and what my mother does. it was a very social part of growing up, when people start inquiring about you. anyways, fast forward to her coming home for 2 weeks, she showed up to my school. keep in mind i was attending therapy during this time provided by the school and the counselor is who arranged the visit. she did a small speech to my class answering vague questions about the military and her involvement. it was my schools way of dealing with 9/11. boosting the approval of military personnel, making it more of the norm. mid speech a fellow student raises her hand and straight up says ""your son told me you died"". the room was so silent. i never felt so small. she hesitated and followed with a nervous laugh saying ""obviously that's not true"" transitioning into more answers not involving my terrible decision. to this day we never spoke about it.",11

"when i was 11, my dad's girlfriend's 22 year old son used to regularly beat my dad up to a bloody pulp in-front of me. i'm 30 now, and i'm still haunted by it... i turned 30 recently, and since then, a lot of things have been bringing up some of the skeletons from my past... i'm realising that i'm still deeply affected by them, and still haunted by them to this day. and honestly, i just wanted to share it with someone..

when i was 11, i remember being one of the happiest, goofiest, rambunctious, cockiest, *naughtiest* kids there was. i had so many friends, played sports, had all these play ""girlfriends"" with all the girls in my class, and had so many healthy experiences living in the suburbs of melbourne, australia. i was just happy and bubbling with life and confidence living with my single dad.

just before the 6th grade, my dad met a woman. her name was dianne. she was also a single parent, except her kids were much older than me. she had three boys between the ages of 22 and 35 at the time, and an 18 year old daughter. 

after a few short months of knowing this woman, my dad broke the news to me that we were leaving melbourne, and moving in with diane to a small rural town in the country. at such a young age, i didn't understand exactly what this meant. but i went along with it, without so much as a peep or murmur.

soon, we moved to the small country town called pylong, in victoria. this town had maybe 1,000 people living in it. and my new school, in total, had maybe 50 kids. my first day of school there was a real indicator of my temperament, as i'd cause the first fist fight in all of the school's history literally in my first day. the reason? simply because another student suggested that i pick a fight with someone. there was no reason. i was wild!

very soon after my dad moved us in, diane allowed her youngest son, peter, to move in with us. peter was 22, lifted weights, and was an absolute monster. my dad was 55. soon after peter moved in, even though my dad bought this house from sale of his previous home, peter began to claim it as his own. he began bullying and intimidating my dad. peter would change the locks and bolts on my dads tool shed so that only he would have access to it. peter used to play with my basketball in the back yard, then kick it as hard as he could across the 1 acre paddock behind us into the overgrown grass so that i couldn't find it after he'd finish. peter would push me over and trip me when i'd try stand up to him.

peter began to regularly beat up my dad. to a bloody pulp. in front of me. 

peter's temper was like a hair-trigger, and anything would prompt him to hurt my dad. sometimes my dad would react a little to peters bullying, and then it would be on. at any time of day or night, peter would just lay into my dad until he'd have broken noses and chunks of hair missing from hair scalp..

one night, my dad was sleeping in my room with me to get away from peter. it was like he was hiding in my room. at about midnight, peter came in to my room with his older brother while we were both sleeping and started both beating my dad up together. 

sometimes when this would happen, i'd run to the next door neighbor's house and beg them to let me inside to call the police. but other times, i'd just stand there in fear watching it... frozen. 

though i only lived there for about 1-2 years, it felt like forever. i'd pass the time after school and on weekends, by literally breaking into whole streets of houses not far from my own. i wouldn't steal anything. i'd just break and enter, walking around in the houses of strangers. i had no friends, i had no outlets, i had nowhere to go, and no one to see... i missed melbourne so so much, and felt like i'd been ripped out of my happy, bright environment in the suburbs, and placed in this town that felt like a prison made of dirt roads and nothingness. i felt isolated, alone, and like i was taken away from everything that made me happy...  i yearned to go back to melbourne where i had friends who loved me, and where ever hung could be normal again. where i could be normal. 

this all happened for about two years. but for my entire teenage life, i was withdrawn into myself. i was shy, embarrassed, scared, quiet, frozen, all through my highschool years... it took me until i was about 20 to come back out again, resembling what i was like in my previous childhood years.

and this might be a story for another time. but all throughout this time, for my whole life, i was also dealing with an alcoholic mother who i'd see on weekends. my experiences with her equally devastated me. she committed suicide (i believe) when i turned 17.

i never forgiven diane or peter. im haunted by them. i sometimes imagine what i would do if i could pay them both a visit, and let them know exactly what they put me through. i'd tell diane that she is a horrible human being, and i'd tell peter (and his brother) that i'm not 11-12 years old anymore, and that iv been lifting some weights of my own.

sometimes i still feel trapped in that house. iv never felt closure or resolution. iv never felt justice or peace... it's hung over me for all these years, and i don't know how to answer to it. i don't know how to forget it all..

i don't remember diane or peter's last name. sometimes i think that that's god's way of not allowing me to do something that i could regret..

thank you for reading my story. 

edit: thank you so much to everyone for your support and encouragement. iv very rarely spoken to anyone about the things such as this that iv experienced in my life, and i'm so grateful for all your thoughts and replies:

1. yes, i absolutely do want to resolve this against peter legally. my dad had called the police, so there would have to be a record of it somewhere. does anyone know how i could follow this up? or if it's too late? how can i make him answer to what he did? if you have any suggestions please feel free to pm me.

2. i see a lot of people are asking about my dad and how he is now. after i left his house when i was 16 (new house we moved into after it all happened), i dropped out of highschool, and moved to sydney with the little amount of money i had. i built a life for myself there, independently.
meanwhile, my dad went into business with his daughters husband, sold it after about 10 years, and used the money to retire on his eldest daughters property in his travel caravan. he loves it, and occasionally takes long solo trips around the outback of australia with his dog. he's at rest, and i am incredibly relieved for him.

"in year 12 i lied to my science teacher, saying i handed in an assignment that i never even started. i ended up getting a b+ on it.. ok so i was taking year 12 multi-science, which was basically the deadshit version of the real science classes available at my school (biology, chemistry  and physics). it wasn't too bad, it just wasn't as practicable as the other science classes.

so 8 weeks out from the end of the term (meaning end of class, start of holidays), we got this assignment. i honestly don't know what it was about, because i didn't do it, but it was this stack of pages that we needed to fill out.

long story short, i didn't do any of it. not a word.

the day finally came when we had to hand the assignment back in. it was a normal lesson, but at the end of the lesson the teacher said ""ok assignments are due today, everyone hand them up"" and everyone shuffled up to the front of the room and put their assignments on his desk in a pile. i didn't get up and he didn't notice.

the next day the teacher came up to me and at morning tea:

 teacher: mattio, your assignment wasn't in the pile with the others, where is it?


me: what, no, i handed it up yesterday?? i specifically remember it because (student) handed his up before mine.


teacher: yeah..ok. i'll have another look.


i ended up getting a b+ on that assignment. at the time i thought i'd pulled a quick one on a stupid adult authority figure and gotten away with it, which felt really cool, but i learned a couple of years later that i was on suicide watch at the time, so that probably had something to do with the leniency.",11
"i was relieved when my ex cheated on me so i didn't have to stay in contact with their kid.. i was in a fairly serious relationship with a single parent for a year and a half. i actually loved them alot and went out of my way to be really accommodating about the fact they had a kid. as a bonus the kid was really cute. having had a step parent as a kid and mercilessly torturing them for ten years i understood that i was very lucky to get a step kid that wasn't a high functioning psychopath so i made extra effort. this quickly became a step-parent scenario and i ended up with alot of 'family time'. the kid absolutely loved me, especially because i got to be the 'fun parent'. i just figured it was part and parcel of loving someone who had a kid so i just got on with it. every morning getting woken up by a  three year old mounting my face with a soggy nappy, getting kicked,punched, ridden, all the snot that was wiped on me, the screaming, the crying, the tantrums. the embarrassment in restaurants when the kid has a tantrum. school runs. lunch boxes. all of the mess,the stains, the laundry. just jumped right in and reached for the baby wipes.

fast forward 18 months and my not-yet-ex has a massive blow out whilst on a weekend away with their best friend. they take tons of drugs, max out their credit cards, lose all their possessions, have unprotected sex with each other, and then comes home with hepatitis. 

i walked out about three minutes after all of this was revealed but the truth is,i was relieved they did something so unforgivable because i didn't have to talk to them again. i hated being a parent and my grief at losing such a significant relationship in such a surprise way was completely overwhelmed at my relief of not having to be a step parent anymore. as soon as i got back to my place i felt the weight lift off my shoulders and i admitted to myself that i do not like children. 

my spouse really loves kids but i've made it abundantly clear that we won't be having any.

"light i crashed a brand new ford mustang at a test drive event hosted by ford. this was many years ago (10+)  when i just first started college. buddy and i were going to cabela's looking at archery gear and lo and behold the large parking lot that cabela's had was converted into a ford demo ride/test drive event. they had a dirt course setup for pick up trucks and a very small coned road course setup for cars and they had the mustang. 

i drove a truck on the off-road course and then hopped into the mustang. before getting in i asked one of the workers, anything i should know? he literally said: just don't crash. we both had a light chuckle. a few minutes later i entered a corner way too hot, brakes locked up and i went right over the curb onto the grass, and i could hear the large round of applause from a nearby hotel that had balconies over looking this area. thankfully no injuries but the car was pretty screwed up, wheels bent, body work mangled, and fluids leaking from underneath. 

thankfully they had insurance for that kind of thing and i wasn't served with any lawsuit as i had feared. 

i wonder if i'm blacklisted by ford. and since then i've never seen another ford test drive event at that location anymore...

"i walked 2 miles with half ounce of weed up my butt cheeks.. back, many moons ago i was a a college party with a few of my mates. few drinks in, the house owner asks us if we want to smoke. me being new to the scene i thought he was talking about cigarette or cigar. we get up to his room and he pulled out a bong and we all started smoking.

so we finish a few rotations of the bong and i decided  this would be a good time to buy some weed for the first time. i smoked a little bit of what i bought and about 30 minutes later i hear a loud bang coming from downstairs.

apparently cops raided the house because you know, college party, small town, people get fairly annoyed when you have a loud music booming at 4 a.m. in the morning. so i panicked because i've never been this high in my entire life(im new to spicy cabbage ok can't blame me) and here i am with a half ounce of weed on me. i don't want to throw the weed away because i paid a decent amount of money for it so i did what any logical human being would do i spread my butt cheeks in a room of about 15 people and stuffed it between my butt cheeks. 

i make my way past the cops as they are escorting us all outside and out the door. then we get to the porch area and somebody says they're going to start chasing us like he's whispering it to me and i'm high and drunk all at the same time and i have this guy behind me aggressively whispering ""run. they gone chase us....."" thinking back to it now he was probably trying to get me to run so the copa would chase me instead of him. maybe he had something worse on him than i did.

i wait till i get about like a half a block away from the house and i just take off running.. the entire time i got my butt cheeks clinched hoping i don't drop his half ounce of weed out my crack. at some point i heard a dog barking and thought it was a police dog. i did the one thing you never so in scary movies.. looked back. i tripped, fell, rolled and popped up to kept running only to realize it was a neighbors dog. i make it about two miles or so to my friend's house. did a reach around only to realize somewhere between the party house and my friend's place the weed fell out. 

so now drunk, high and somewhat bloody me thinks, hey this is the perfect time to go back in the middle of the night with a flashlight looking for the weed i dropped that smells like ass crack and party juices.

i never found that weed :-(.

tldr: bought weed for the fist time at a college party that got busted by the cops. stuffed the sack of weed between my butt cheeks to conceal it as we're being escorted out. ran from cops thinking they were going to chase me only to lose my weed from my butt cheeks.

**edit1**: i also have another confession. i posted this to r/tifu this morning and made an edit becasue someone said the story was unfinished. it wasn't very eventful after that but here is what happened. 

i ended my night going back to my friends house after failing to find my weed and passing out on his livingroom floor. 

prior to passing out, i vaguely recall playing his flute for a girl that was at the party who also ended up at his house. i was trying to marinade(yes marinade so don't bone apple teeth me) her but failed horribly. i don't know how to play the flute. never have a day in my life before then. 

i also don't remember much more than that about the night. just that my friends gf had a cute yorkie(?) that i was obsessed with all night.

i hit a kid on the top of his head as hard as i could. this happened about 9-10 years ago. our family would go to our friends house every thursday for bible study and the parents would be in the living room for a few hours and all the adults had a kid or two. there was about 15 kids at this house every time. there was one bastard that was so crazy and destructive and he never changed. he would just break random shit and do reckless kid stuff i think he was about 4-5 years younger than me. one day i was playing xbox 360 and for some reason you got in front of me and slapped me hard as fuck. this was the first time i'd ever experience anger. i been wanting to hit this kid for the longest and this was the only justifiable time to do so i took advantage of it. i got up and took the sharp end of the xbox 360 controller and   whacked him on the top of his head. he fell crying like a little bitch and surprisingly none of the parents got mad at me and let it be. me and my brothers still laugh about that die and i still don't feel bad.,11
"stopped caring at my fast food job, and if you're nice to me i'll hook you up with a lot of free food snuck into your order. the past few months i've absolutely hated my job. i've asked multiple times to be moved to the back area (kitchen) but management have put everyone else in there but me. so tonight i changed my tune, and i gave almost every customer that was nice to me tonight at work free food or made their ice-cream/sundae/milkshake really freaking good, and i don't regret it. cameras picked up everything but i doubt they'd even watch it. i'm pretty high up there but i'm so sick of them not listening. we were understaffed as hell for a tuesday night and i was doing four things at once but like a little manners goes a long way at maccas. pretty sure the most a customer walked away with was 2 six pack nuggets, 2 apple pies, 2 ten packs of bites, 2 cbd burgers, upsize on their fries and some sweet and sour sauce added onto their original order. it was the best shift i've had at that shit hole in a long, long time doing stuff completely against the rules. it makes me hope there's a special place in hell reserved for abusive, asshole customers.

"i auctioned off my virginity. i was 18 and really tired of being a virgin, i was super super embarrassed. i didn't really have any close guy friends and had no idea how to flirt or even communicate with a guy, i was in a really depressive state. i felt like i missed out on the fundamentals of highschool love, especially since i'd been looking forward to it. 

i also however needed some money for school, and really was just craving any sense of excitement in my life. i went to this random as website that's similar to craigslist and made a post about my virginity with pictures , and instructions on how my fantasy went. and then  set the bids at 1,500 and the bids reached 10,200, it was so weird the amount of guys who just have money like that. 

anyways the guy who had the highest bid was 50 and owned some sort of business im the trades not sure what. he wasn't ugly, he was actually decently attractive but then again i was into older guys so i'm biased. we set up a date and he took me to a nice hotel, bought me a dress, we went to dinner, and when we came back there was flowers, chocolates, and a present for me in the room. and rose petals on the bed and candles lit, all like i imagined since the 8th grade. 

we had sex it was okay i mean i had nothing to compare it too at the time it felt amazing. but the best part was after since he made me feel comfortable, and we just talked all night and cuddled and made out.i left the next morning and that was that. i finally could move on,with my life and not focus on my virginity. 4 years later and im actually a sex addict so it's weird how i was such a late bloomer, yet so into sex.

"i had my phone sing me happy birthday and cried. shit man, i thought i'd only use this account once but here i am again lol. today is my 25th birthday and i live alone in texas. the rest of my family is in california and only my brother and sister wished me a happy birthday.  i had to call my mom and dad for them to tell me but it's  not because they're shitty parents but because my cousin died in a car accident so they spend a lot of time with my aunt and uncle so it probably slipped their mind.  

for the past 3 years i haven't gotten a present or a cake (not that i really care) for various reasons. 3 years ago i was in rehab in mexico heating clean from opiates and meth. 2 years ago i relapsed and went back to mexico to enter myself into rehab again.  last year i was working and again lived alone. this year is the same except i got fired and am currently looking for work. 

so today i open google assist and say 'it's my birthday"" and google proceeds to sing my happy birthday.  i got goosebumps and started crying,  i just didn't expect it. i never really cared for my birthday but when i heard that something clicked and i broke down crying and i don't know why. i know i'm depressed and have been for awhile but this hit me hard for some reason. 

sorry to ramble but i just had to get this off my chest. btw i've been clean from opiates and meth 2 years and counting. r.i.p cousin,  i love you<3

edit: thank you reddit!! you've made my birthday so much more wholesome and memorable!! internet is an awesome place but reddit is the best!!

if any of you want to do me a small favor then i would really love for y'all to take pictures of your neighborhood, parks, buildings, etc. i love admiring everyday lives of other places, architecture, parks, etc. especially places outside of the united states.

""i think i just shit myself"" i told him but he heard it with the biggest grin on his face. i'm a 19 year old girl that just shat herself in front of her boyfriend, and to make it worse i had the guts to tell him. he wasn't phased at all, in fact when i came back with no shorts on he called me his hot mess. i don't know where this is going except for my boyfriend to make a confession on this reddit saying that he has a shit fetish.",11
"i'm a peeping tom but instead of watching i listen and do the deed during.   

i live in a basement of someone's house cause they're family owns apartments and so this guy made his basement into a nice studio loft. my landlord is same age and gender as me (late 20's male). i like to use porn to masturbate but there is something about hearing/seeing people have sex in real life that really gets me off. my landlords girlfriend is a definite moaner and i've always loved women who moan during sex. i realized i could hear them if i didn't make any noise and i thought it was pretty hot; it would get me in the mood and i would use porn to finish myself off. 

anyways, to why i made this post. i discovered that the closer i was to the vents, the better i could hear them. i have a vent in the closet that is the biggest one down here, maybe it's the main outflow for when the heater/ac goes on? whatever, point is, i can stand on a stool and put by ear up to the vent (it's about 7ish ft high) and listen to every moan, breath, and ball slap that goes on and i think it's so fucking hot. my landlord and his girlfriend are pretty attractive people it's not like i have to pretend they are someone else while listening either.

i feel like a trained dog because whenever i think i hear a moan, i rush over to the closet, get on the stool, dick-in-hand and put my ear up to the vent, hoping to get some audio porn. half the time it's a false alarm, but when it isn't, it's so hot and i proceed to have a great orgasm. 

so another lesser confession would be that one time i heard what sounded like moans and so habit kicked in. stand on stool, dick out, ear to vent, proceed to masturbate. half-way through i realize it's the girlfriend crying and making moaning sounds, not sex-moaning sounds. i almost shot my load off to a woman crying by herself at midnight. fuck that was weird. fuck i'm a weirdo for even getting half-way there.",11
"took a shit outside of girls house i was banging, and her landlord stepped in it.. so i was about 19 years old, and i had just got out of my first long term relationship with my ex girlfriend of 2 years, and it was a hard break up, so i just wanted to screw everything in sight, well to make a long story short, i ended hooking up with my high school crush who was a few years older than me (21) she was a total babe, could buy me beer, but fucking crazy. well we started hooking up pretty regularly, and i started staying at her ""house"" for like a week (drinking, banging) i lived with my parents at the time and it was super cool to do. well i remember it was a sunday, because the cowboys were playing, well we had been drinking keystone light all day, and i ordered some dominos that night, so basically a recipe for disaster for any normal human stomach. so naturally i had to take a nasty shit like an hour later, and i was so sick, sweating, clinching my toes, everything to hide it. well her ""house"" wasn't much of one, just had one room with a bed, and a tiny kitchen, and a bathroom, and the bathroom was literally right next to the bed where we were sitting, so she definitely would've heard it, and smelt it, so i didn't want to do that because i didn't want to embarrass myself, or be gross. so i got to the point where i was so sick to my stomach i was about to shit myself, i told her i had to run to my car and smoke a cigarette, so i went outside pondering what i should do, and it dawned on me that i had paper towels in the glove box, so i grabbed them and went to the side of her house and did my business by the side of her house, and it was dark out so i wasn't worried about anyone seeing me. well i came back in feeling like a million bucks, we banged some more and i stayed the night again. well the next morning about 7am we hear loud banging on the door, and she went to the door to check it out, and i heard some angry talking for about 5 mins, and she came back all confused looking and i asked ""what's wrong"" and she said ""my fucking land lord is all pissed because he stepped in dog shit, and is blaming me for having a dog"", and obviously i don't have one! i almost shit myself again from laughing because i know he stepped in my poop, and neither of them knew it was me. funniest thing i've ever done, and i'm so excited to let people know finally.

"my boss never approves my work if she thinks its a first draft...so now i lie. i do all the marketing for the company \(making literature, website design, adverts\).

i found that no matter how hard i try, if i hand my boss my work, she will make changes to it...always. the changes would be so useless as well ""move that image 1cm down, use different bullet points"".

then one day i went into her office with my brochure and i used the word second draft...my work was approved straight away.

suddenly a pattern emerged, if my boss thought that my work was a first draft, she would make changes to it, if she thought it had already been revised she would actually look at the design of the brochure and make constructive changes if needed.

so now i will always walk into her office saying ""would you mind reviewing this brochure, originally i had designed it like \*blah blah blah\* but now ive put it like this"", even if it is a first draft.

just saves me so much time and she actually looks at my work this way.",11

"i blackmailed a 26 year old man when i was 16. when i was a 16 year old girl i was a frequent user of tinychat. i was a regular in this one for amwf relationships and was quite popular and loving the attention. i became friends with a 26 year old man, truly believing he was my friend and totally not just a creep. we would skype sometimes and he would tell me some really weird things about himself, but i would laugh it off because i have a gross sense of humor. 


one time he told me that he met a struggling single mother and he felt bad for her, so he paid her a few hundred dollars to do an enema on camera for him. she took the money and blocked him. he said he was so upset because he was just trying to be a good guy and help her out because she seemed desperate for money.


fast forward a month or so and i'm underage drinking and skyping with him. i had been passively complaining about being poor, as a 16 year old without a job does. he figures this is his big chance and gives me a proposition. i assure you that this next part is 100% true. he offered to pay me $120 to stick baby carrots in my butt for him. i'm like ""ummm, no thank you"" and he raises it to $160 if i do it twice a month for him. i tell him ""i respect your kink but please keep it away from me"". he keeps trying to convince me and offering better prices. meanwhile, i have another chat open with a bunch of friends from 4chan. i tell them whats up and ask if one of the boys wants to do me a favor when the time comes.


i sheepishly agree with carrot guy that i'll stick baby carrots in my butt for him and ask him when he wants me to do the deed. he says right now. that catches me off guard because he was at work in his cubicle at the time. im like ""wont people see"" and he tells me he'll go into the parking garage. so i go to my kitchen and realize that we only have regular carrots so i grab a few of those and a knife and tell him that i'll just cut them to baby carrot size. 


picture a dweeby 16 year old girl whittling away at some carrots with a knife while a 26 year old asian man watches from his office cubicle, dictating how big she should cut them. every time i would hold one of my creations up to the camera, he would tell me to go bigger. let me tell you, the end results were at least 3 times bigger than a regular baby carrot.


when i was nearly finished with the preparations, he made true on his promise and relocated to his car in the parking garage. that's when my head jerked in the direction of my bedroom door and i scrambled to hang up the skype call, clearly in a panic. i enter the 4chan chat and tell them project buttcarrot is a go. one of then calls carrot guy, pretending to be my furious and overprotective father. he asks carrot guy if he knew that what he was doing was illegal and could put him in prison. carrot guy sounds fucking terrified and is apologizing profusely(i'm listening in on the call). my 'father' tell carrot guy to send $500 to my paypal and he wont call the cops.


i bought christmas presents for all of my friends that year, never spoke to carrot guy again, and i didn't eat carrots for a long time.


epilogue: i'm 22 now and i moved across the country about a year ago, to the city that carrot guy lived in. no big deal, it's a really big city. imagine the adrenaline rush when i'm walking down the street and pass a familiar face on the sidewalk. i had to do a double take. never in a million years did i think i would come face to face with the one and only carrot guy. but there he was. luckily he didn't recognize me as my appearance has radically changed since i was 16, but that didn't stop me from looking over my shoulder for the rest of my day out.


i want to say that i have no regrets but honestly i have a few. one of them is that i didn't ask for more money, as he had a nice enough job anyways. another is that i didn't just go to the authorities. sometimes i wonder if he really learned a lesson from this, or if he went on to prey on other teenagers and if i could have saved them. 


edit: didn't realize how angry this would make people so i'm gonna clear a few things up for yall. first, this story is kind of funny so i tried to work that into my narration and wrote my two regrets in a way that i thought would be funny. yes, i do wish i got more out of the deal. because now that i'm an adult i realize that $500 aint shit.


more importantly, i really do regret not calling the cops. however, as dumb as they are i had my reasons not to. the biggest reason at the time was that i didn't want to ruin his life. i had gotten to know this guy over a period of almost a year, he painted a sad picture of himself to me so that i would pity him. and even though he was preying on me, up until that point i viewed him as just my friend. when you are a young girl in a predatory relationship like this, you don't notice the red flags like an adult would and you don't know the proper response. extorting him for money was not the proper response. if i could go back to that moment with an adult view of the situation i would have called the cops. but i didn't. whoops.


time and time again, i think about reporting him still. however, i no longer have access to the skype account i used to talk to him. and on top of that, unless they changed it recently, when you log onto a skype account with a new computer it doesn't carry over old conversations. i have no idea if there is a way to recover them. if there is, hit me up and i can provide sweet sweet proof of this whole thing(provided i can remember the email and password to the account itself).


but yeah, i probably shouldn't have blackmailed him. however, he probably shouldn't have tried to buy literal cp soooooo",11

"i failed to stop a stranger from being raped.... remorse

never told anyone this, it happened about a year ago.

so i live in a flat that's in a part of town that has a lot of bars and breweries. in the summer i like keeping my sliding door open and i often stay up quite late at night. as a result i hear rowdy, drunk people shouting and carousing from time to time. 

so i was curled up playing video games really late one night and i hear a loud yelp. sounds like a girl. but i thought ""eh, bars are closing right about now."" then a few moments later it was a shout. but again i ignored it, loud noises, even shouts, were common late at night. besides, i was comfy and engrossed in my game.

..then it was a scream. and, regretfully, i *still stayed put.* i lied to myself thinking ""*i'm tired, and its probably nothing.*"" 20 tense seconds later and i finally hear her voice again, **""raaaaaaapppeeee!!!""** holy shit. this is happening. she's been getting **raped** this entire time. my stomach flipped and dropped. i jumped up from my couch, grabbed my baseball bat, and sprinted out into the parking lot. but it was too late, all i could see was a car screeching out of the far end of the lot. i couldn't even make out the licence plate number.

i could've saved her.

"my daughter died years ago and it's still almost impossible for me to make it through father's day every year.. remorse

every year on father's day i put on a brave face and go to work. i talk on the radio all day to people i don't know and who will never see me and often they will wish me a happy father's day as a pleasantry when i ship them to the next frequency. i know they mean well and i'm gracious to them and thank them, but it cuts me to the core. 

most of my coworkers are male and many of them have young kids of their own. they show up to work with the silly crowns, stickers, cards, and mugs that their kids made for them at school on friday. i'm not mad about that and i don't fault them for wearing them...that's what dads are supposed to do when they have kids they love and who love them back. i loved my daughter and i still love her but she's gone and she can't love me back and it hurts. 

i don't want to hear commercials about father's day on the radio when i'm driving to work or home from work tomorrow. i don't want to have an internal argument with myself about how i ""should"" feel on father's day and whether not i'm ""really"" a father. i don't want my coworkers who know my story to awkwardly avoid talking to me all day and elbow someone who doesn't know my story when he brings out a picture of his kids to share with us. i don't want people to tread lightly around me...my pain should not affect their happiness. i don't want that--but i also don't want it to still hurt like it does. most of all, i don't want to come home to this empty house after work like i've done every day since my wife left 3 years ago. what i do want is my family back.

"lied to my parents(divorced) about why i didn't want to walk at my college graduation. they died 6 months later.. i don't even know if this is the correct sub. whatever, this has been weighing on my soul for the last year. long story.

growing up, i knew my parents were never going to last. four separations throughout my adolescence told me that. my parents were polar opposites. my father was attempting to build a business from scratch. he worked his body to the bone. his poured everything into it. i see now that this was his way of giving everything he had to my mother and myself. but he had a hardened exterior. his expectations for me and my mother were exhaustively high. this didn't bode well with the type of person my mother was. she was sensitive. my father's world was his business. hers was me. the only child. i see now she gave everything she had to me. every life lesson she held. every bit of wit and intelligence she attempted to show me. she needed support and love. things my father wasn't able to give.

&#x200b;

fast forward to the day after my high school graduation. my mom bailed. i didn't blame her. i see why. but it was utter chaos at home. my dad's tough exterior was broke in ways i didn't think was possible. she never spoke to him again after that day. i know she wanted to move on and start new.

&#x200b;

college came and went with usual successes and mistakes that often posses the average 18-22 year old. my father was so in love with my mother yet. it was so genuine. it's so sad what it took for him to show it. my mother was mentally checked out though. never brought up my father and i sure wasn't going to discuss it. with that being said, she made some poor life choices after the divorce. career-wise and relationship-wise. mistakes that carry consequences that can't be undone.

&#x200b;

my graduation day was looming. i couldn't put it on my mother to have my dad there. i thought it was so unfair to either one to have to miss it. i decided not to walk . my friends, girlfriend, everyone else did. i remember watching the ceremony and feeling so alone.

&#x200b;

the mistakes finally caught up with my mother after graduation. her life was in full-blown tailspin mode. i should haven saw it coming. but i didn't. it happened. suicide. the whole nine yards. 22. mother dead. that shit sticks with you, let me tell you.

&#x200b;

my father was the best father he had every been in his life after that. we had such a good relationship. something i didn't even think was possible growing up. we cried, hugged, shared fears. everything i wanted growing up. it was as blissful as could be, given the circumstances. but fate had one more cruel card to deal. my dad a very routine surgery lined up a few months after my mother passed. you know what's next. he was the 1 in 2 million surgeries that resulted in death. now here i was at 22, without either parent.

&#x200b;

after 5 years, i'm strong. my parent's gave me everything they could, in their own respective ways. i have my mother's compassion and love, but my father's strength and determination. i've never been depressed. people have it far worse than myself. the 22 years i received will be forever cherished with them.

&#x200b;

but of all the things feel horrible about...beyond all others is the moment that i stripped away from all of 3 of us. it would have been the first time in 4 years we all would have been together. it gained nothing. all because my 22 year old self was worried how my parent's would respond to seeing each other. i never apologized for this action. it was so selfish. above all other actions, this weighs the most. it was so self-inflicted. actions are permanent. this one is my largest mistake.

"i'm transgender.... but i despise the general fakeness and selfishness of almost every transgender person i've ever met. i don't really want to go too far in detail, but suffice to say, the mocking of women, the grandstanding and tears over simple pronoun mishaps, the lack of basic understanding into gender theory, the hijacking of each others posts with their own (1-up-like) successes with their transition, the fake voice, the ridiculous garish wardrobes that don't match for shit, the victim mentality, all of it. i fucking hate all of it.

if you feel like a woman, why the fuck do you not feel like a woman insofar as much to want to ya know... actively reduce the stereotypes and archaic definitions about what being a woman _even fucking is_. because apparently for most of us, it is turning into a whining peacock with no hobbies or interests outside of being fucking trans. 

i have a great job, a great career, my co-workers respect me, because... idk... maybe i wasn't awkward as fuck in my interviews and so actively focused on the fact that i'm trans (like every other moment in their lives) that i couldn't even answer a technical question without whipping my estrogen dose into the equation.

i'm just fucking sick of it. you all are making us look bad so get off your fucking ass, quit whining, get a real fucking job, learn to match your wardrobe, stop dressing like you're 14, and gain some fucking weight so we don't all look like we have multiple disorders stacked on top of each other.

well i guess i went into detail. oh well, if you are trans and you see this. get your fucking shit together, no body cares about how hard life is. i'm half-black, trans, and kicked out at 17 but i don't use that as an excuse to survive off of the kindness of others and falter on my responsibilities -- not only as an adult -- but as a fucking _productive member of society--. and if you do want to focus solely on being trans. great.

read some fucking gender theory and philosophy and make it mean something. no one wants to hear you whining and complaining going in circles because you haven't read a book in so long (other than affirmation after affirmation) that your vocabulary has dropped to the level of a 3rd grader.

fuck.

"i was a substitute teacher and called an 8th grader a 'social media slut' and it still haunts me today. a few years ago i used to work as a substitute teacher. i was in my early twenties when this happened and have felt guilty and ashamed ever since. i can't justify my actions and i accept it was an absolutely idiotic thing for me to do. and in no way is this post an attempt to justify my actions.

i think about this atleast a few times a week and feel so ashamed of myself everytime it pops into my head. the memory is normally triggered by songs, associations or thinking of my future. and i guess i still to this day, fear very much it will haunt me in my future adult life.

i had been working as a substitute teacher for a few months before this happened. i was met everyday with atleast some form of insults from kids from all different ages. it wasn't anything new for the substitutes to be insulted, mocked or tested by these kids. i shrug off whatever they tried to insult me with (being single and alone, being ugly, you name it). but of course this wasn't every single student, class etc. everyone were so very different from each other and of course it also depended on their maturity

i heard stories of students refusing to do stuff for a teacher because she was of polish descent or students mocking a teacher constantly for being overweight. and because of this i think i always mentally prepared myself for the worst and i had build up this mindset to snap back if it was really needed (scolding them, sending them off, etc.)

one day i was having class with some 8th graders. i won't lie, i liked their class. they were mature, nice and knew how to treat each other respectively for the most. i don't know if i ever let my guard down at this point. but there was this girl, she was a good student and was also so very polite. she was on her phone just browsing instagram non-stop. i told her to put the phone down, but she kept at it. i shrugged it off because i knew me keeping telling her to put it away would be a waste of time and energy. at some point i'm sitting at a table with only 2 guys and said girl in the classroom, alone. the others had scattered to do their assignment somewhere else.

we start talking about social media and who is really is the most active of all the classmates. the boys quickly point out the girl and start talking about how she is always posting stuff, normal everyday stuff, fashion and sometimes content that would lean a bit more to the mature side. before i really give what i'm about to say a thought, i blur out ""are you a bit of a social media slut? as in do you post every single moment you can of your life online?"" the guys laugh and i guess at this point i had never idea what i really just called her.

a few days later a teacher approaches me and asks me if i called one of her students a slut. at this point i realize what i've done. i tell the teacher i of course didn't mean to offend or hurt the girl. i ran out from the teachers lounge as it was still recess and i found the girl. i tell i feel very bad for what i called her and that it was incredibly wrong of me to say such a thing. and try my hardest that i was in no way trying to hurt her. she smiles and nods and tells me it's okay, but i'm still just shaking inside my body. i tell her to have a good next class. the recess ends and i move on to my next class. the entire car ride home i feel so ashamed of myself as a person and how i could say such a thing to a person at her age.

and that's my confession. i'm not trying yo justify any of this. it's simply some guilt i don't think i can ever shake off myself and i hope other people will do better than what i did that day. i was of course fired and sent my employer a final message telling them how i understod why they termitnated me and that i'm deeply sorry for the inconvenience i caused.

i'm sorry for my english as i'm from europe. i hope you could make some sense from it.

i'm sorry.",11
"when i was a kid (11 and younger), i vandalized my primary (elementary) school numerous times.. just for info, i'm female. i absolutely hated my school. i was diagnosed with adhd only a couple of years ago, at age 32. i daydreamed a lot, talked non stop, and my imagination was out of this world. that didn't work with institutions lol. i hated both schools, but primary school..ughhh. my attendance was poor, i'd fake being sick a lot. 

the school was located in my neighborhood. we used to play on the fields and courts during closed hours. we were allowed to do that, just couldn't go around the back of the school. i had friends, but there were these times i'd like to hang out with myself. that's usualy when i did bad shit. that's how you don't get caught! i wouldn't purposely hang solo to do bad stuff though.

three incidents stick out in my mind:

this one wasn't solo, but my act was. we wanted to play football/soccer in the dome, a little building in the back of the school property. i have no clue why? just to see if we could? we got screwdrivers and took the doors apart. so while everyone was playing in the dome and running behind it, i had a better idea. i grabbed some rocks, and wanted to see if i could deflect them off the dome into the school's windows. i could. smashed about 3 or 4 windows. each sound of the glass breaking was sooo satisfying. 

one day i decided to go to the football pitch with my golf driver club. we were poor kids, we'd find random things, so it's not like i had a set. just one driver. i wanted to see how far i could hit the golf ball. the school was kinda far away and i wasn't aiming for it. i swung and hit the ball. then i hear a smash in the distance. any normal kid would've stopped and ran. me? i wanted to see if i could recreate what i did. 2 more times.

this was probably the most idgaf moment. i was walking around with my football/soccer ball. i decided to go over to the school. i went into ther back area around the trees. genius me decides to kick the ball into the air for fun... around trees. the ball gets stuck. i attempted to climb the tree, but was unsuccessful. so, i see some big ass rocks. figured i could knock it out if the tree. i stand looking at the school, with the tree in between us. i start throwing rocks, and they're flying over the ball and into the windows. i smashed 7. this one was extremely satisfying, because the following day at school we had assembly. my headmaster was furious, asking if anyone knew about. i was gleeming on the inside.


young me had so much anger inside because of my home life. so i took it out on the place i hated. my emotions were internalized, i was quiet. so the anger festered. adults didn't know i was bad, because i wasn't disrespectful, and i never got caught. what i did was messed up, don't get me wrong. just giving some context.",11
"i only married my wife so she wouldn't commit suicide. i really needed to get this off my chest. we were high school sweethearts that aren't very compatible. i've been married to her for 3 years. i had found a woman i think i loved right before we got back together the last time but i ghosted her because i could bear there thought of someone's death being on my hands. it wasn't an idle threat either. i had to pick her up from the hospital after an attempt, she almost didn't make it. i think i can love her but things are so muddy i can't really tell. i would never be unfaithful this just is eating my up inside.

edit: i really didn't think this would take off like this. not all of the days are bad days. i've been trying to help her make friends and things have been getting better. i've just felt like although i'm complacent it was not my choice. i wouldn't say i'm miserable or anything and she has been working on herself.

edit 2: guys i've said my piece, this was mainly to vent and i appreciate all of the concern. this is exhausting so i'm going to stop following this post. i do value myself but i will make sure that me and her both come out of this okay. i won't abandon her but this will be better. thank you.",11

"there was a girl with cancer in my high school. when i was in 9th and 10th grade there was a girl at our school with cancer, she was totally bald and never wore a wig, everyone was always extra nice to her as you could imagine.

 i only had one class with her where we set in desk clumps of two, so i can't say how she acted with other people but she was a total bitch to me. every time i tried to talk to her and be friendly she would find a way to laugh at me and be rude, and whenever i answered a question in class she would be quick to tell me how stupid i sounded. 

i could go on about her but in short this girl made me dread my 6th period everyday and i knew i could never say anything back to her or complain because she would play her cancer card and make me the bad guy despite whatever she did, she even smirked sometimes when she said particularly mean things like she knew i couldn't do shit.

toward the end of 10th grade i found the seat next to me empty and our teacher announced she needed to stay at the hospital full time because of her deteriorating health, i could barely contain my joy.

"i wish we had never adopted this kid.. my wife and i had been trying for a couple of years to have our own kids, but found out we could not.  so, we went the way we had talked about many times before, and went through adoption.  because, hey, every kid needs a home, right?

that's when we came across our now adopted son, nate (names changed, of course).  nate was the bastard son of a whore of a mom who fucked who she could for drugs, money, etc.  his bio father had some sense and convinced mom to put all three of her kids (nate was the only one of his, the other two -- a brother and sister -- were from unknown / different fathers).  she agreed.  and that was when nate was about 6.  he was technically removed due to deplorable living conditions and abuse, but she didn't fight to keep him.

we met him for the first time last year.  i was sketchy on him.  he appeared to have adhd.  not a deal breaker, but wouldn't have been my first choice.  he never looked at us, jumped up and ran around the restaurant we met at, and had a hard time focusing.  hell, he's a 9 year old kid.  kids have a hard time sitting still, and get nervous.  ((i figured)).

my wife fell in love with him (i was still sketchy, but we *had* met other kids, so he wasn't our first choice at the time).  we started getting more info on him, planned on meeting him more, etc.  it was a learning curve.

we took him to chuck e cheese, just to hang with him for a day.  he was all over the place.  eh, kids.  no biggie.

we started finding out more from the foster parents (who we didn't care for -- they seemed to be brainwashing their kids, and seemed to be in it for the money).  nothing major, but i was still being cautious.  we figured maybe he had either adhd or some high functioning autism.  again, not a deal breaker, but it was something i'm not used to.  my wife had experience (volunteer and career) with special needs children.  he seemed to be growing on us.  called us mom and dad once, we started having fun together, it seemed to be a good fit.

we noticed (closer to the day we took him home for 6 months before finalizing the adoption) he had ""addictions"".  mostly videogames.  not too unusual, again, he's a kid.  kids are supposed to love videogames.  fuck, we both like them.  why not?  but he became aggressive.  like, wouldn't listen to you and if you turn them off or threaten to take them away, he'd become violent to throwing the controller, kicking a chair, etc.  we nipped that in the ass as soon as possible, limiting him and explaining why.  (we eventually took it away altogether -- may be explained later.)

he saw a therapist / psychologist / optometrist / general physician / and several other professionals.  one diagnosed him with adhd.  another thought autism.  another thought reactive attachment disorder.  all seemed... less than great.  but we're attached.  we'd get through this.

that was about a year ago now.  

ever since then, at least every other day (if not every day), we have had to put him in restraints (all okay per dhs, his therapist, and others).  we've had to get onto him.  we've tried different reward systems.  we've tried starting nice / second chances.  we've tried everything we can think of.  fuck, even trying to show unconditional love (when we feel nearly defeated).

he's constantly lying about everything and anything, he plays dumb, he threatens to be ""bad"" (which we aren't afraid of -- we've shown him many times we're not afraid of him), he breaks things, he has no emotions, anything.  never shows remorse (unless he's told to; ""tell them you're sorry!"").  does what he wants, even when he knows it's going to get things taken away.  he's tried (and somewhat succeeded) to hurt his dog, several times, because he ""wants to see how it feels pain"".  he's been pure hell.  he ""understands"", but doesn't care (from what we can tell).

just tonight, we had a date night, and dropped him off to a ""parent's night out"" group at the local y.  we had a great time, just being able to be ourselves.

we get back, i go in to pick him up.  the assistants there pull me aside and tell me he was caught trying to (well, not so much trying -- he did) grab several girls' privates.  twice.  that was all the info i needed.  i grabbed him, a bit embarrassed, brought him to the car and had him explain to my wife what happened.  of course, we've been talking to him for several hours now, explaining why that was bad, etc.  but, again, he shows no remorse and just makes up excuse after excuse.  long story short, he wanted to, and so he did.

after everything we've been through...  i honestly regret adopting him.

i don't know if i'd adopt again if given the chance.  even if given the chance to go back in time and change my mind on him and switch to another kid, i don't think i would.  ~~i'd~~  we'd be much happier without him, or any other child in our home.

i wish nate had never come into our lives.  and i'm pretty much sure my wife wishes the same thing.

**tl;dr** this motherfucker we adopted has got to be fucking crazy.  no other explanation.  ",11

"i gave up my baby for adoption and it hurts a lot.. throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

i'm 18 years old and i gave my daughter up for adoption ~12 hours ago. she was 2 days old. i left the hospital and crawled into bed and haven't gotten up since. after 9 months of being pregnant and going through the journey of carrying a baby and to come home without a baby is heart wrenching, i knew it would feel weird but i never knew it would hurt this bad. to know that i had a couple who were a few months ago total strangers, who have stepped into my life to take care of my baby and love her as their own and give her something that i can't is overwhelming. i don't regret it, i want that to be clear. i know in my heart it was the right choice. i'm smart enough to know that she doesn't deserve to be brought into an already complicated situation. she deserves 2 parents that can provide her with the stability and the love she deserves. and i can't give her that. to give her up wasn't sad, it was overwhelming. but now it's hitting me how empty i really feel. i wish i could crawl into a hole and die. i feel like a failure, i feel like this is my lowest point. her parents offered an open adoption and i said no. simply because right now, i don't think i can handle it. i don't want to sound awful, but my biggest hope is that i can forget about this. i feel awful, and i don't want to remember this feeling, i would like for my baby to grow up knowing she's adopted and that this was an act of love, but out of shame and guilt, i don't want her to know who i am. if you took the time to read this, thank you. this is the only place i could think of to dump my thoughts and clear my mind, it means a lot to me to know that someone out there, on some little speck of the internet, is listening to me.

in my shop, bananas are weighed to determine the price, using a scale at the till. when a customer is rude, and is also buying bananas, i place the bananas on the scales and then push down slightly with my hand. i realise this doesn't impact them much, the difference would only be a few pennies, however it gives me some satisfaction, even if it is slightly petty. 

edit: a small minority of people in this comment section are acting like i overcharge every rude customer i come into contact with, by large amounts. i do not do this. i may overcharge the odd customer by pushing down on the scales a bit harder, but i don't do this to everybody. for the most part, i just grin and bear it, however everybody has to 'vent' occasionally, and so slightly overcharging those people is how i get some satisfaction from a rather mundane shift. those saying i need to be fired are seriously overreacting. some people here just need to get a grip.

jay ended up moving to a new school and about 2 years later i found out he died by getting crushed by a trailer attacked to a 4 wheeler.

"i have horrible social anxiety and i have never posted anything online before. i have been on reddit for over a year and i follow hundreds of subs. i always check to see what's new regularly, however i have never had the courage to say anything. 

i have always had really bad social anxiety and i don't talk to people irl, but i am much less intimidated by face to face interaction. online is different because not only do you have to think and spell out every word your saying, you also have to consider the tone and context of your passage. also people online are a lot more forward in attacking you for your choice of words or any mistakes you make in spelling/grammer. 

 just writing these words and knowing that someone might read it is a huge step for me. i feel so much stress just trying to find the words to say.  the last time i post words online it was on myspace and i was 15. that was in 2008. 

in 2018 i want to find my voice and improve my anxiety. i want to be able to leave random funny comments or share with the world things i have created. i want to contribute to the community even in the smallest of ways. this is my beginning.

edit: thank you to everyone who took the time to read this and respond. i really didn't think this post would get so much attention since the topic is something lame. i'm very happy my post was relatable to so many people. i thought out a clever/cute response to say to each and every one of your comments and i would have responded back to you all but the idea of doing such a thing is terrifying to me. 

your encouraging words really boosted my mood to be a bit more confident new year's eve. i even went to a restaurant for lunch and when the waitress asked what i wanted i looked her right in the eyes and told her in a clear and calm voice. she even understood what i said the first time without looking at me like a weirdo. i know this might not sound very impressive, but that's not what usually happens when i go to a restaurant. 

then moments later awkwardness struck when she asked for me to give me back the menu and i fumbled it and knocked over some stuff on the table. no mess to clean up but still on some days this would be more than enough to make me feel anxious and i wouldn't even be able to eat anymore. i just brushed it off and put it right out of my mind. 

i know there's gonna be trolls out there if i say something online, but for me, the anxiety comes from the fact that i have to live with the words i say. i don't really mind if anyone wants to say something mean to me because i know that if someone gets mad about something i say or do it is usually more of a problem they have with themselves then with me.

i know nobody cares who i am and everyone will forget what i say in a couple minutes, but i don't ever forget. i still ruminate over awkward moments i had as far back as elementary school that i'm sure absolutely nobody remembers but me. i find myself lying awake sometimes thinking about stuff that happened that doesn't matter to anybody at all, but it still matters to me because i have to live with myself. i guess that's kind of what anxiety means. 

that is why online is scarier for me. i notice irl most people really aren't very good at talking. most people like to stick to the same generic lines and when i respond hesitantly they just move on from me. also, i can see in their eyes and hear in their voice if someone is genuinely interested in what i'm saying. people that are good at talking usually do most of the talking for you so they try to make it easier for you. 

it is because you have so much time to think of what to say that i find online intimidating. i feel as though i'm not good/smart/funny/worthy enough to anonymously give my words. i feel as though everyone will reject me or ignore me and i will feel bad not about what they said but what i said. 

like yesterday i spent a long time making and proofreading my first post about how i've never said anything because i'm scared to make spelling and grammar mistakes, and i still managed to make a couple spelling and grammar mistakes. i would have changed and edited what i said many times yesterday but i think that's kinda funny.

it really shouldn't be like this for me or anyone. there are plenty of nice people online who are not out to harass you or put you down. i know this and i need to practice being able to write down and send out my thoughts. thank you again, everyone, for showing so much support to me. i appreciate every one and i hope i keep the courage to stick around this year!",11
"i lost my virginity in my backyard, in broad daylight, outside of the car. i haven't told anyone this story before, but here it goes. changing a few small details so the guy i lost my virginity to doesn't ever find this story. lol

i was a virgin well into my 20s. i was raised religious and had it in my mind that i was waiting until marriage and it somehow made me a better person. ""virgin"" became like an identity to me. as i got older, i kept rejecting sex at every turn. i started to get really curious, and felt ashamed of my being so much older than everyone i know and being a virgin. some of my friends were even getting married. it was like a biological clock started ticking in my mind or something, i don't know how else to describe that. around that time i find out a long time guy friend was attracted to me, and my birthday is coming up. i think ""do i really want this year to end with me still being a virgin? this is getting ridiculous"".

i talked to my friend about everything and flat out asked if he would take my virginity so i wouldn't have to feel like an outcast anymore. he agreed to help me out. 

this is where it gets nasty, so to prevent this from becoming nsfw/pornographic, i'll make it brief.

we ended up having sex before we got into the house. i pretty much jumped him. we were supposed to hang out for a couple hours before anything happened between us, but as soon as we were going around the back of the house i started kissing him and one thing led to another.
we were out in the open (around noon!!!) and our neighbors easily could have seen us. at the moment, i didn't even think about how reckless it was. we didn't use condoms either.

..i never thought i would lose it that way. i kind of regretted it for a while, but i've come to terms with it. 

the bright side? i didn't get caught or become pregnant so that's a plus.

so i'm at a club i won't name that isn't a thing anymore for unrelated reasons. at the time i worked there as a barback. i made shit. one perk though, was i could easily get sauced for free nearly every night from unfinished drinks. one night, things got extra interesting.

i noticed and older well dressed sorta dude break up and mix what looked like a pill into this mojito. at the time, i actually thought he was trying to liven up his own night, and quickly downed it in one go as he was bullshitting with some freind of his. doesn't seem to notice i sniped his 10 dollar spiced beverage, hes already drunk, mission accomplished. or so i thought. 

i knew i was in for a good time and that i was also off in 10 minutes. as i was getting my share of the tips i notice this pretty decent looking girl come to the guy's table looking suprised. apparently it was her mojito. he looks flustered and gets her another. 

so i get home and start rolling balllllz. i know this isn't the sort of dosage one uses to enjoy themselves. i wake up the next day on the living room floor. i don't remember much, but my roomees said i was acting really strange and just concked out.

pretty sure i prevented something nasty by being a sneaky bastard.",11
"i played a very long lasting prank on my roommate in grad school, forgot about it, was reminded of it 1.5 years later, and still haven't told him it was me.. i just now remembered this after graduating from grad school 2 years ago because i was looking through my old flash drive and found the mp3 file i used to do the prank.

so our first year in graduate school, when we first moved in to our apartment, my roommate bought a new gaming computer. he left for a week to visit his family, so i snuck in his room and set an alarm on his computer to play every first friday of the month at 8pm. the mp3 i chose for the alarm was the spongebob squarepants theme song 800% slower (https://youtu.be/4oyo4bcy1sc). i saved the alarm and went about my business. i told my good friend about it after i did it, and then completely forgot about it.

well, as you can tell from the link, the spongebob squarepants theme song sounds scary as shit if you slow it down by 800%. it sounds all eery in the beginning, then the pirate comes in with the super low raspy voice and sounds like a ghost. then the children chime in with ""ayyy ayyy captain!!!"" but slowed down by 800% it sounds like they are wailing in hell.

after a year of living in the apartment together, we rented a house together with my other friend that knew about the prank when i first did it. after about 6 months of living together in that house, we were all in the living room playing dark souls on our computers, and it happened. the alarm came on. i completely lost my shit. my friend almost died, he couldn't breathe. we cried laughing for 15 straight minutes until we hurt and almost threw up. i had totally forgotten about the prank, then here it is, 1.5 years later, totally unexpected and that god damn alarm comes on when we are all together. it was glorious. we had never laughed so hard in our life. my poor roommate just immediately alt tabbed out of the game and closed the alarm like he was a pro at doing this shit, which i guess he would be after doing it for 1.5 years, and then he said ""yeah, my computer does that sometimes, it's like it's haunted or something."" at that point i couldn't tell him it was me. i mean it had been playing on his computer every first friday at 8pm for 1.5 years, how much of an asshole would i look like if i told him ""oh yeah, it was me. i did that then totally forgot about it."" i even discussed it with my friend the next day asking if i should confess. i never did, and he eventually found the mp3 file in the alarm folder on his computer and deleted it, which fixed the problem. here i am, almost 4 years later and i still never told him it was me. so tim buddy, sorry about that.",11
"my boyfriend hates this raccoon that always comes around but the reason it sticks around is because i feed him, & i don't have any pets so i like having him around. makes me feel like i have a pet.. he digs through our trash, sometimes he comes on our front porch, & my boyfriend wants to call animal control because he thinks he has rabies but ive just been feeding him all our food scraps & the raccoon adores me. he doesn't ever get to close but he eats the food & i don't try to pet him at all but i'm just glad i can keep him healthy for 2 years.

"stole property and put the blame on someone else to keep apartment and split them up.. it was a really bad time in my life, before i managed to get on disability. i had no income and no one who believed i was really ill and needed help. or if they did believe me, they didn't want to help and labeled it a ""me"" problem. expected me to fix it and get on with living, like all i needed was a fucking antibiotic.

mental illness sucks. there is nothing glamorous or good about being stigmatized and marginalized into a byline.

was living in a 1 bedroom apartment with my ex and his current (both of our names were on the lease and he moved her in without asking; he wouldn't let me off the lease even after i moved i am still on it) when i had to take him to the hospital for feeling sick.  found out during that time that him and his girlfriend were doing heroin and she'd hit him with a dirty needle. i already knew she was struggling with addiction, but didn't know that he was using actively with her.

at the time he'd broken up with me because he couldn't cope with my mental illness issues; as soon as i was involuntarily hospitalized the 2nd time he moved on. i came out of the hospital to having lost my job. losing him on top of that was soul crushing. everything became about money.  he made twice as much as i did, we split the bills 50/50.  having no income stream meant i couldn't contribute anymore. instead of working through it with me he decided to tell me i had to leave (he would be patient while i tried to find a place but i had to leave was the bottom line).

two months after he was hospitalized with endocarditis and i dealt with her prostituting herself out of our house that climaxed (terrible pun intended) in her being beaten by a ""client"" who then stole money from her and destroyed the house and her getting more and more aggravated with me being in the apartment we shared, i broke down. through a family friend i managed to get a restraining order against her to keep her out of the house.  i put the house back together as best as i could, then realized that she hadn't payed the rent or any of the bills.  instead she had drained his bank account in addition to the prostitution to support her habit and lifestyle.

realizing he wouldn't have a place to come home to and also realizing (she had stolen my foodstamps, the only bit of contribution i could make while trying to find gainful employment etc) i had nothing to eat, i took some of his things and pawned them or sold them outright.  when he came home and noticed it was gone, i told him that she had been the one who stole his stuff. i went so far as to have the family friend mentioned above remove his television, gaming systems, and computer in case she came back-- figuring everything else that had disappeared was pretty replaceable in time.  i told him in the hopes that it would convince him to leave her.

&#x200b;

despite saving the fucking apartment and getting the lights turned back on, i wish i'd never done that. he deserved better.

&#x200b;

edit: upon rereading, i feel like it came out that the family friend helped me steal the things, i want to clarify.   feeling remorse over what i'd already done, i asked them to take the things so they would be safe until he got out of hospice care and i wouldn't be further tempted to act out that way.",11

"my brother and i stole a puppy.  this happened in 2003. my brother and i have never told a single soul. there was an article in the local newspaper about a ~~guy~~ asshole who had killed his dog with a spading fork and this asshole happened to live one house over from where my brother stayed at the time. we knew this because the night of the incident the cops was called on this guy by a neighbor who went to investigate the noise and caught him red handed, this neighbor in turn told my brother. he still had a puppy that the spca for some reason never removed from his care. 

bro and i love dogs and are both pretty pissed and want to kick his ass. so about three days after the article we are having drinks one friday night getting ready to go out and the issue comes up. my brother gets this sly look on his face and tells me we need to ~~steal~~ save the dog as we could hear it whimpering and yelping from time to time and we didn't want it going the same way as it's mom. 

we ditched going out and decided to stay in and wait. at around 2 the next morning we put our plan into action. we jumped the wall of the property next door with some meat and made our way to the dog killers house were i jumped the next wall again to get into his property and lured the puppy to me with the meat. it was obviously scared and barked at me but i eventually managed to grab it and get out. 

the poor animal was terribly neglected and infested with parasites. the next morning when my brothers gf walked into his place the pup was clean, fed and sleeping on the sofa. we told her we found him in the road the night before coming home from the club. she of course helped to find it a good home. no regrets",11

"i stole my first stepmom's wedding ring. bit of backstory, my first stepmom was a lunatic. she treated her son (my stepbrother) like he was her husband, rather than my father. she would take him, my sister, and i to the store, buy him a super cool, expensive toy, then berate my sister and i for asking for something too (and it would usually be nothing even close to being as expensive or big as what he got). she would let him bully me, including knocking out my four front teeth (which i had to go without for almost a year cause the teeth weren't ready to come out) and every time i tried to fight back he would immediately cry and run to her and i would get in trouble from her and my father, who only went along with her shenanigans cause he wanted someone to take care of him (aka a wife). 

the final straw was when my half brother was born. i was only 7, but i was expected to raise him. i had to feed him at ungodly times in the night while my dad and step mom slept, i had to change his diapers, bathe him, all of the things you had to do for a baby and all the while i was expected to still do well in school and choir (which i ended up having to quit because of all this). 

one day, they left me home alone (another thing they did frequently) and i decided enough was enough. my stepmom had taken her wedding ring off for who knows why and i saw my opportunity to mess with her. i went into their bathroom and just snatched it up, along with a couple other pretty rings i saw. i hid it in a hole in the couch that only i knew about and waited. 

well she gets home and has a fit cause she can't find her ring and of course accused me, but for once my dad stood up for me and said i would never. i left the ring there for a couple days until she gave up and had to believe she had just lost it. i then moved it to a toy box in my room where i forgot about it for many years. me stealing the ring was the first in several things that caused their marriage to fall apart (not that they needed any help, they constantly fought from day 1 of their relationship). i found it again when i was moving out of my dad's house at 18, and by then my crazy stepmom divorced my dad and he remarried to another lunatic lady (hence why i moved out before i even graduated high school). i still have the ring, as it's very pretty and it constantly reminds me how i basically ended my dad and first stepmom's marriage. i still think it's hilarious to this day.

"light i've faked my accent for 11 years. when i was 10 years old, i moved from scotland to new zealand and have been here for almost 11 years now. in these 11 years, i've somehow managed to fake an nz accent to most of my friends and work colleagues. 

the only time i speak in a scottish accent, is when i'm around family. it can get pretty confusing if a mate is round, or lets say i meet a girl etc. i think the reason why i put on the accent was to fit in at school, because kids are cruel and would make fun of the native tongue, so i just kept it going all through high school up until now.

i've realised now at 21, how stupid it is that i had to fake an accent to fit into society. i think back now and wonder, what if i never faked my accent? would life be different? probably not.... but i just thought i'd share this with you all. 

i've also been told scottish accents pull the ladies, so i better start now before it's to late.

"i confiscated my son's weed and then smoked it. let me start by saying my son is a very good kid.  he's a high school senior who gets mostly a's, he works a part-time job, and he doesn't get into trouble. so when i found a bag of weed in his pants pocket one morning while preparing the laundry, it came as quite a surprise.  i had no clue he was getting high.

flash forward an hour.  i'm in my backyard, chatting to arlene my neighbor, about what i found.  arlene has four kids, all grown and out of the house, and she's my go-to for parenting advice.  i ask her what i should do. she says, ""let's smoke it!""

i couldn't believe i was doing it, but 20 minutes later we were in arlene's kitchen smoking weed out of a tobacco pipe.  i hadn't smoked pot since college. we got really, really high and we giggled for hours in her kitchen, making and eating all kinds of food and dancing to the radio.  it was so much fun!

when my son came home from work that evening i saw him go into the laundry room, where his pants were folded along with the rest of his clothes, and take the basket upstairs.  he never does that, so obviously he was looking for his weed.  a bit later i called him down for dinner and we had a normal meal and conversation.  i sensed some relief when the meal was done and he went back to his room.

i still haven't decided what to say to my son.  meantime, arlene has the rest of the weed and i will have no regrets...unless she smokes it without me!

"nsfw i have a daughter. when i was fifteen i had a friend that i was kinda close to and i had a crush on her for so long. she was a lesbian though so that was out of the question. one day she started talking about how much she wanted a kid (she was 19 at the time) and of course being close to her she talked to me about it a lot.  

now i was still a virgin and very much attracted to her so i start hinting that i could impregnate her. we very slowly came about this conclusion together and agreed it would be a good way to go about it. she wanted someone she trusted to do it and i was almost like a brother to her.  

my best friend at the time let us use his house to do the deed and it was really awkward. she played music on her phone so any noises we made wouldn't be heard. at first we tried standing up with me behind her but she was too short so we wound up with missionary. she was just as awkward and nervous as i was so she didn't want to take her pants off all the way but i quickly realized this would be impossible in this position so i quickly took them off of her and went at it. it got really heated and it seemed like she was into it which really surprised me and turned me on more which fixed the nervousness and i finished after a few minutes. after that point it was somehow much less awkward and we left, chatting a bit throughout the day.  

a few days went by and she told me she wanted to do it a few more times to be sure it worked. she didn't exactly have to twist my arm to agree but my friend's parents were home at weird hours that week and we couldn't use his house again. there were some pretty expansive woods near our high school that we would skip class in all the time so we found a secluded spot in there. the next few times we wound up having sex were blissful.  

after a while she found out she was pregnant. she had told me beforehand that she didn't want me to be an actual father figure for the child and her family was gonna take care of everything for her. it's been six years and that still holds true, she doesn't want me to be in her life (not in a malicious way) and is taking care of the child herself. she wound up blocking me on social media because my friend wound up telling people about it and she thought it was me but we cleared that up and there's nothing negative between us. although i think i wound up blocking her at one point after because i got a facebook message request years ago from a different profile saying it was her and she just wanted to talk about the situation. i haven't talked to her for about five years now.  

you'd think this would be a great situation, right? i got to have sex with a girl i was crushing hard on and even though it resulted in her having a kid, i don't have to put any time or finances into it. most guys would kill for the opportunity i'd imagine. but i have a lot of problems that i want to discuss a little bit. first of all, there's this strange, deep twinge in me that jerks when i think about the fact that *i have a daughter* and *i'm a father*. i've procreated and technically fulfilled my biological purpose in life. i don't necessarily want to be in her life or want to meet her, but it's weird thinking about all that and it fucks with my head sometimes.  

my current so is an absolutely amazing woman that i love dearly and i know i'm going to marry. she's my best friend and my soulmate. we've both vehemently agreed that we aren't having kids; we aren't financially stable and even if we get to that point, neither of us could deal with that kind of stress. she doesn't know. i haven't told her and i don't know if i ever will. i feel like despite our deep connection and love and understanding for each other, she would look at me in a way that would make me feel as if i'm some sort of monster. i don't want to disappoint her like that. i just can't. i don't want to let this past decision affect something so pure and wonderful in my life. it's like i'm dealing with a heavy guilt that's never going to go away.",11

remorse: not all days, but most my teeth hurt and i have no way to stop the pain. i live in the usa and cannot afford insurance to get it fixed. if i had the money to get them all pulled and replaced i would, but the dental place told me it would cost over $7,000.

my life has been going well for the most part lately and i feel horrible for even thinking of wanting to die to escape the pain. i have 2 kids that need me and a family that loves me, but love doesn't buy new teeth.

i did it to myself back in highschool by throwing up after each meal. i don't smile often and when i actually do i have to cover my mouth because i don't want others to be grossed out by my teeth. most of the time i just grin to the right side. my kids don't like me going to their school, meeting their friends and teachers because they are embarrassed of my mouth. i try not to show it, but that hurts more than the physical pain i endure from the infection that is spreading.

anyways, thanks for taking time to read this and i hope that you (the reader) live in a country that would help with dental problems.

i feel like i'm violating her trust on the one hand, on the other hand, she is posting these letters to a public forum where anybody can see them. 

she forgot to log out of her account one day so i noticed the username and didn't think much of it at the time. thought maybe it was one of my kids friends who had used our computer then got distracted back with whatever i was doing. 

then one night i'm scrolling through unsent letters and i see this username, so i read the letter, and it's very clearly describing a situation between my wife and i. 

so i go into the post history and i learn a lot of things. feelings she has for an old boyfriend (who she's found reasons to meet up with twice and nothing's happened, though part of her would like something to) chief among them. 

i want to broach this subject with her, get all these problems out in the open, work through them. i don't want her to feel as though i violated her trust though. i'm caught.

"my smug friend is getting a karma smack down and i struggle to care.. let's call her sharon. 

sharon talks all the time about her perfect marriage and how her husband knows he's not good enough for her, so he would never do anything to screw it up. 

meanwhile, she treats him like crap. when they're together, she mostly just orders him around. but the vast majority of the time, she's out having cocktails with friends while he's at home with their kids. 

he's a musician, which she thinks is ""daaaarling"" but she's not interested in it. still, she likes for him to be in a band because then he wants to hang out with her less. 

last year, sharon met this woman... we'll call her chloe. sharon likes chloe alright, but sharon's husband thinks chloe is awesome. 

anyway, about 6 months ago, sharon was giggling with me and a few other ladies at brunch about how now she barely ever has to do anything with her husband... instead, she just asks chloe to hang out with him and everything is fine. 

we pointed out the obvious issues with that. especially since chloe is beautiful, single and an easy ten years younger than us. she's a singer/songwriter and they share a ton of other interests. and look, i'm not suggesting men and women can't be friends... but sharon openly admits that she almost never sleeps with her husband and now she thinks it's a good idea to encourage him to have a close friendship with a woman he's almost certainly attracted to?  just because she wants to keep him occupied?

ok then. good luck with that. 

yesterday, i had to stop at sharon's to pick up some things my daughter left over there.  she told me to just walk in because she wasn't home. i did as she said and there was chloe with sharon's husband... fucking in the living room, full view of the front door.

"my father told me to kill myself.. my dad and i️ haven't had the best relationship in the past few years. i️ caught him cheating on my mother and now he blames me for everything wrong in his life. i️ started college this fall and we hardly talk. anyways, one night, my family went out to dinner and of course, my father and i️ started arguing. probably about something really dumb and not worth the effort in the first place. however, my dad started to get very angry and started to say some things that no father should ever say to their child. i️ am adopted (from russia) and he would say (more often than i'd like to admit) that he should ""send me back"" because he ""didn't love me"" and thought i️ was a ""waste of money and space."" then it came out. he said ""you know, if you killed yourself, life would be a lot better... you should do it."" that night was my first attempt at suicide. thank the lord i️ didn't die because now my life is relatively better. i️ have only told a handful of people in my life about this and it feels good to get it off my chest.

"my friend gave me a pet who died in the next day. i never told him and i pretend to have the same pet.. disclaimer: english is not my first language, so...

during my early teens i was best friends with a guy who had a couple of cockatiel's (domestic birds). i, an obssessed animal person, used to say that i would die for one of these birds  since i found them so pretty. lo and behold: in my 15th birthday my friend gave me one sweet baby cocktiel.

i was so happy with my baby bird, however i didn't had the tools to properly take care of it since my family and i didn't know we were getting one. also, i didn't know how i felt about domestic birds since they don't get to be free in nature (even though they don't know how to survive in the wild).

the first hour of my cocktiel at home was stressful  since my oldest dog didn't love the idea of a new family member and was trying to kill it in every opportunity. after some time, things got calmer and my mom had the idea of leaving the baby bird locked in the bathroom, so my dog couldn't find it. we were planning to get a birdcage and a bunch of cocktiel's toys in the next day so our baby would be comfortable.

next day in school, i was telling my friend how much i loved his gift and he told me about his own birds. he really loved them, and for him to give me one was a big demonstration of affection. i felt pretty great about my relationship with him and the cocktiel was a symbol to our love. he wasn't a guy who expressed feelings with words and at that point (us being friends for 10 years) he giving me the cocktiel was the first time he expressed that he trusted me.

so, it is the second day of my baby bird home and i notice that she was (yea, i decided that she was a girl) getting pretty smart around the bathroom, jumping next to the toilet and bathroom box. i didn't thought about that much since i was getting her birdcage soon, but warned my brother to always leave the toilet seat down, afraid that she was going to slip and fall in the water. then, i went to my afternoon class.

when i returned home, first thing i went to do was check my little cocktiel. yeah, you guessed it. she was dead. drowned in my brother's piss. he forgot to leave the seat down. i had a full breakdown, tried to ressuscitate her but no success. and then i thought about my friend and freaked out even more. i begged while crying to my mother to fix things.

the day after her death i wasn't in school, i went to my local pet shop and bought a baby cocktiel, now with a birdcage and all. i couldn't brought myself to tell my friend that my cocktiel had died in my brother's urine. my friend visited my house regularly so a new baby cocktiel was the only option for me. this happened years ago, i never told my friend the truth. only me, my mom and my brother knows that our cocktiel is a fraud.

"my husband is a narcissist who blames me for everything. i've just put a deposit down on an apartment and will be moving out this week!. it has been a little over a week since i left. although i know i will end up giving up the house and everything i left, i'm okay with the bare minimum for a while. 

he is obviously very upset. he even punched my ass as i ran up the stairs to get the last of my forgotten items after leaving. unfortunately i was too occupied with getting out with my things that i never documented this event. it was the first time he has hit me, but he dragged me out of bed on our honeymoon after i fell asleep before having sex with him.

all of these signs point to me doing the right thing and getting out. at times i feel like a failure and the holiday this week has sucked being alone. these next few months are going to suck, but i keep reminding myself it is worth it!!

thank you to everybody for all of the support! i know this was a quick marriage, but i honestly tried my best before leaving. if i would have seen this coming, i wouldn't have let it go so far. however, he didn't inform me of his ill intentions early on, so here we are now.",11

"i've been lying about my age on this site, creating a whole fake persona.. on the internet, it can be very hard to be taken seriously. this is especially true if you're a teenager. 

for over two years now i've been insinuating and telling people that i'm a 25yr old engineer, when in reality i'm still a high-school teenager. 

it all started when in the comment section of a since-deleted r/politicalhumor post. i was debating some random guy when i accidentally revealed my age. after that, the whole argument went straight to insults and name-calling. ever since then i've been faking it for the sake of online credibility. i even went so far as to make fake stories about high-school a decade ago. 

recently, however, my urge to get internet validation has stagnated, and i just want to be myself again. i still think that there are many misconceptions about modern teen life, and that most people are too quick to assume we are superficial, braindead morons, but in my opinion it's better to be laughed at by others then to be artificial to yourself.

edit: thanks for all the support. i would just like to clarify a few things. first off, i don't advocate for revealing personal information online, notice i still haven't given you an actual number for my age just a range. i also think lying for safety is completely acceptable. i, personally, will just not reveal any personal information real or fake in the future. i also mentioned politicalhumor. i was not trying to defame any political group, just showing a subreddit where both sides can get tangled in over-passionate hostile arguments. 

edit 2: thanks for all the support again. i think though, it's time to take a break from the internet. i got way too caught up in act that i let too much time pass. thanks for the support.",11
"lied about pregnancy being ectopic to avoid judgment from religious friend. a while back i worked as a tutor for a well to do family and really got along with their live in nanny. she became something of a confidant/auntie figure for me and i would sit and chat with her for hours post tutoring sessions. during this time i became pregnant with my asshole ex boyfriend's baby and confided in her about it. she was so happy for me and kept talking about how things like this were meant to be and all part of god's plan (not religious myself, but she was super catholic and i appreciated her conviction). 

long story short, i had an abortion, and when she asked me about how my pregnancy was going i lied and said that i'd found out that it was ectopic and had terminated for that reason. not true at all. i had an abortion for a whole bunch of reasons that i'm perfectly capable of articulating most of the time, but to her, i lied. 

this happened years ago and is a small white lie in the scheme of things, but it still bothers me to this day. i hate that i felt the need to excuse myself, that i couldn't own my actions. i don't feel that i have anything to be ashamed of in terms of the abortion, but my lie to her suggests otherwise.

"light i love my dead end job, small car and tiny house.. growing up i always felt i needed to do something big, become a doctor or the next big game designer, get a big house and nice car. i always had the general mentality that i would need to go to university to be successful etc. 

i dropped out of uni a couple of years ago and decided to work my ass off in a factory and get some savings under my belt (with the help of living with parents). 

i bought myself a small car which i love. it's a corsa, the most generic first time buyer car there is. i decked it out with a nice sound system which makes driving so fun. 

i quit the job at the factory which was making me miserable (long physically intensive, 6 day weeks) and decided to become a pizza delivery guy. i love every second of it. being in the uk i get minimum wage, petrol money (which works out it covers my personal use too) and tips on top. 

i basically drive round, listen to music and podcasts and eat pizza. i am very introverted as well, i love the independence and solitude. my boss is chill too so that makes everything easier. i don't work until later on in the day, so i have my daytimes free and i'm a bit of a night owl anyway. 

i have a small house that i've filled with my hobbies and things i like. i have some savings, and even with the job i have i still manage to add a little to it at the end of each month.

"been lying to my wife.... i met her in college. it was pretty much love at first sight. we've been together 22 years and married nineteen. we have two kids and she is honestly the light and love of my life. but the woman can not cook worth shit.

she knows she's not great, and she's been trying for years to get better. but she starts out following a recipe, gets confused or lazy, and starts making crazy substitutions and changes. goddammit woman, broiling and boiling are not synonymous and you can't just replace allspice with all the spices! 

but when she's slaved over something for hours, and she's looking at me like she does, i don't have the heart to say that her cooking is shit on a plate. so i tell her she's getting better, swallow a few mouthfuls, then pretend to run a few errands so i can grab some fast food.

luckily she works later then me so i usually have dinner going before she can gets home. if she offers to help i tell her that she needs to put her feet up. i'm a pretty good cook, so most nights are fine. it's just anniversaries, holidays, or other big days that bring out her sudden desires to cook.

my wife is pretty much perfect in every other way, so i don't want to hurt her. but i've got to get this off my chest here:

honey, you're quite possibly the worst cook in the world and it should be illegal for you to even try. i love you, but for god's sake woman, put away the oregano and step away from the kitchen before anyone gets hurt.",11
"just sent an anonymous box of cow poop to my abusive stepdad for father's day. i have no regrets. i know this isn't a mature thing to do, but this man made my life a living hell for most of my childhood. i've been going to therapy for years to recover, i've been diagnosed with ptsd due to the abuse, and i have nightmares about him on a weekly basis. my life has gotten enormously better since i left home but i had a breaking point today when i saw a dad and his little girl out on a daddy-daughter date and i just thought ""why couldn't he be nice to me like that?"" growing up, even though he abused me daily, i still wished he would accept me as his daughter and love me, i learned later that this is called a trauma bond.  but he never did. i wasn't even a bad kid, i never misbehaved, i made straight a's in school, i was very shy so i didn't party or do drugs. he loved my older sister and hated me for me. so i was reminded of all of this seeing that cute dad and daughter pair, hid in the bathroom to silently cry for a bit, then i ordered cow poop to be shipped to that abusive a**holes home

edit: for those of you wondering, he got the package and was piiiiissed lol. i have him blocked on all social media but my mom called me to tell me to stop, i just told her the same crap she and him told me when i was growing up being abused: ""its not that bad, you're overreacting quit being so sensitive""",11
"my wife has cancer and i miss sex with her so much. i feel bad that i miss physical intimacy. remorse
my wife has stage 3 breast cancer and is a year out from chemo ending. by all indications chemo and radiation was a success and she is working her way back to having a normal life.  she is 49 and we have two gorgeous children and a wonderful family.i love her so much. i am very blessed to have her in my life and have her love. unfortunately the side affects of of the drugs she is on is that it is inducing menopause . she has absolutely no libido anymore and is struggling with body image problems (scars on her breasts), weight gain and tiredness. 

adding to all of this is that before she came down with cancer i cheated on her and we actually separated before trying to come back together and work it out. i have worked on my issues and  trying to regain her trust as much as possible. it has been three years since everything blew up. i screwed up and made a lot of mistakes and vow never to let myself go that route again but with all that is happening i find my mind wandering to porn and this other woman.   i know she worries about me leaving again and i have tried to show her in every possible way that i am committed to being there.  i have been in counseling for years working and we have just started marriage counseling again. i never imagined i would cheat on my wife and am completely blown away that i did. i screwed up. i own it. 

i miss having sex. i miss going to bed after sex. i miss falling asleep with her on me. our kids are older now and i was so looking forward to having an empty house and waking up on sundays to have sex without worrying about the kids. note that sex has always been difficult for us to talk about and communicate our needs around. it has gotten so much worse now. anyways  i feel like i am going sideways and feel ourselves drifting apart like we did when i cheated. i am trying to right the ship and pull together but i am so tired of trying to fix what i feel is broken. 

it has been almost six months since we had sex. i have taken up smoking pot and working out like a mad man to induce the same relaxation and physical exertion. better than the alternative but my wife doesn't approve of my smoking pot and worries that i am getting in too good of shape :)  i love when she holds my hand and she falls asleep on me and i love holding her hands. sometimes that is enough for me but i miss my wife. 

cancer sucks..


thanks for listening


edit - so thank you everyone for all your comments. righteous indignation and empathy mixed with bewilderment and sadness. this is life. it is messy sometimes and no one is perfect  - including myself - and including all of you - internet strangers. as i mentioned in another post this is the trifecta isn't it.. cancer - sex and infidelity. let me say this. my wife has been out of chemo for a year. my relationship with this other woman ended 3 years ago. i moved back in and after a year she came down with cancer. i have not spoken to this other women since i moved back in. she has contacted me and i asked her to leave me alone which she has but i have seen her creeping on me a bit online and it has played games with my head and caused me to think about her more often that i want.  do i think about this other woman ? sure. i felt i loved her at the time.  this was the confession. do i think about what my wife is going through. every single day. 

regarding the sex  -i have not had sex due to the cancer with my wife for 6 months. prior to that it had been about a year due to the chemo. prior to the cheating we rarely had sex and had grown very distant after raising our kids. we rarely went to bed together and i felt lonely and went out looking for something.  it was always very difficult for us. more to the point though it isn't about nutting to me. it was perhaps when i had the affair but i have realized very resoundingly that what i was searching for before wasn't sex - but rather intimacy. i have found myself happy when i can hold my wife, or have her head fall asleep on me. i want more though. i want her to reach for me and to seek me out. i don't think that is selfish - but rather human nature. i need that and want that with my wife. 

so at the moment am i happy? most definitely yes. is our marriage better now than it was before? resounding yes. it is a work in progress. i have been seeing a counselor working on my shit for the past 3 years and i have been requesting/pleading and begging my wife to go. she doesn't like counseling and it is hard for her to open up but i am happy that she has agreed to go and i intend to try to get things better in the intimacy area. i am happy and blessed with my family and every day am thankful that i have her to wake up to. she is the most amazing strong woman that i have ever seen. she handled the affair with such grace that i cannot express how amazing she is. my mother died of breast cancer and died alone (with me and my sister there) after my father cheated on her. so this hits home for me that i would/could do the same to my wife. 

am i happy that i am married? yes. it is the most amazing and difficult thing but when a couple can work past some shit instead of throwing it out -  it is pretty amazing. that internet strangers - is what life is about . i cherish that.

"i told my girlfriend to kill herself and she did. remorse 

we had been dating for 3 years and she was like my best friend. my first impression was that she was this cute girl who was really fearless and her life was perfect and nothing bothered her. turns out she was and still is the most unstable person i've ever met in my life.

there was a point where she was constantly calling me crying about something that had upset her. like she found one roach in her new apartment, or because exams were killing her and she's stupid, or because her friends cancelled on her or her father isn't listening to her again. each and every time she called, i would drop everything i was doing and go help her. it got to a point where i was often sacrificing important matters, one time i even left a job interview for a really good company because she was having a body dysmorphia breakdown. 

her mental breakdowns eventually overshadowed all the good times and i found myself centering all my decisions and time on her. friends & family started saying this was toxic and she was dragging me down so i finally broke up with her in person and comforted her for an entire 5 hours after. just sitting there holding her while she cried. she had begged me to stay and promised she'd get better and that she needed me. that's what kills me every time...

after a few weeks of not talking (i tried contacting her just in case she needed help but she stopped answering my calls), she called me while i was in a class seminar and i got so mad for some reason because everyone could hear my phone ringing and my professor was giving me the murder eye. i got madder than usual, almost freaking lost it and ended up telling her to ""fuck off."" thats seriously what i said...and then she started crying and told me she was going to kill herself because she's hurting and me thinking about all the ""she's manipulative and toxic"" drift my family & friends were on, i just told her, ""well do it then."" and hung up and went back to class.

i don't know why i said those things. i was just really angry and annoyed but after a few hours, i was okay and tried calling her back to apologize but she didn't answer. then i found out from a friend that she killed herself the next day.

i think about it every single day and its literally eating me up inside. i quit college, i'm addicted to stuff that i probably shouldn't even say on here, and no one wants to be around me anymore. i feel like a fucking murderer sometimes all i needed to do wasbe there for her and maybe she wouldn't have done it. or at least not be an ass and tell her to do it. 

the funny thing is everyone thinks i did her some good and that it's so beautiful that the love of her life was the last one to talk to her. i keep thinking that maybe if i hadn't been the last one, maybe she'd still be alive.

i'm crying now.

i'm sorry maci.


edit: just woke up to all these replies and bawled like a baby again. i had posted this because last night i wasn't sure if i was gonna make it myself and i feel overwhelmed by all of your compassion! thank you for your replies and your messages! i know that i'll always live with this forever but you guys give me hope that its okay to try. i didn't think twice about quitting college and giving up on the things i loved because i didn't think i deserved it anymore. to be honest, i still don't, but this gives me a bit of hope that maybe everything just might be okay eventually.

"when i was younger i got somebody expelled from high school and arrested for blackmailing to tell my religious parents i was gay.. when i was younger i was a really mean and angry. my dad used to beat me and i got beat up at school a lot. made me wise up real fast. in that school you couldn't show any weakness because then you'd get beaten up and bullied worse. part of me just functioned i guess on like auto pilot. i'd sometimes do bad things because i felt i had to and thinking back it was messed up, but it's a part of my past now.

i am gay, but nobody knew about it at the time. my family also don't know. they are extreme catholics and if they were to ever find out about it they'd of disowned me i'm pretty sure. my dad would often say how much he hated gay people. it was something i never wanted him to know because he'd hate me and be ashamed if he ever knew.

i ended up having sex at the age of 14. it was with a man who worked at my high school. yes i know it was wrong and messed up, i don't want to go into detail about that though. all that matters is that some kid i was in the same group as once snatched my phone and read my texts. he found out i was gay and started bullying me for it for months. he would tease it and shout it at me when people were around even though i told him to stop. he seemed to want to humiliate me with the information and i tried to explain about my parents to get him to stop, but instead he started blackmailing me saying he was going to tell my parents if i didn't do what he said.

he made me give him my xbox 360, wii and ds. he took all my video games, my bullfrog, i had to keep giving him money and do his homework for him. whenever he wanted something he'd just use that information against me to blackmail me into doing whatever he wanted. he made my life into a living hell. he'd also make me say horrible things to people to make them cry or hate me. the worst thing he did was made me to ask out some ugly fat girl and the dump her immediately after kissing her. i did everything he said because i was so scared of my dad finding out. i even ended up deleting all my social medias and smashing my phone because he'd contact me and it'd make things worse having him messaging me outside of school. i felt like i couldn't tell anyone or get help, he had this one thing to completely hold against me for the rest of my life. at the time i even considered suicide because of him.

after a while i snapped. i plotted to get the kid expelled so i would never see him in school again. i got the man i had been sleeping with to give me $800. i then met with a friend's brother at the time who knew a drug dealer and bought as much cocaine as i physically could. i also bought some knives. i planted it all in that boys bag and when the sniffer dog came through our school they found it on him.

he was immediately expelled and couldn't speak to me outside of school anymore because i had no social medias or mobile for him to contact me through. he got put on some kind of programme for extremely badly behaved kids i think i heard. it was the most ruthless and calculated thing i think i've ever done. i found out later his house was searched and his father was involved with drugs, so it didn't help his case at all. the kid no doubt kept saying he didn't know where the stuff came from and i bet they just saw his druggie dad and didn't believe him.

i didn't feel a shred of guilt when it happened though. i thought he was an idiot for testing me so much and the moment i found out he was expelled i was actually so relieved. as i grew up and matured more i mellowed down a lot. i became kinder. i feel bad for what i did now looking back. i'm sure there was a better way of dealing with the situation than that, i just couldn't think of anything at the time and felt desperate to keep my secret from my family.

all my friends stopped talking to him when he was expelled. my parents never found out my secret. i have since moved away from my home town and family and although life isn't great i'm glad i've moved past such a terrible time in my life. oh if you want to hear an update on the guy who was blackmailing me it turns out he went to prison for raping somebody so i don't feel as bad, but i still feel bad.",11
"i don't pick up after my son right away.. i'm a single dad/co-parent.  my son is a kindergartener and i pick him up every day after school and watch him until his mom gets off work and have him every weekend.  after a weekend of him being at my house, there are toys every where.  i don't pick them up right away, because seeing them makes me think of him (damn onions, when i type this).",11
"i've been wearing women's underwear for six months to keep my wife oblivious to the fact that i cheated on her. . i've been having a long-term affair with a young woman who works for me that is still ongoing. i know reddit likes to crucify cheaters, but my wife cut me off sexually years ago with no regard for how hurt and rejected this has made me. and yes, i have tried everything to fix it. she refuses therapy. she sees nothing wrong with her having no libido and doesn't understand why my hand doesn't suffice. hence, i get my physical intimacy needs met elsewhere. and i refuse to divorce because i want to see my children every day. with that out of the way...

six months ago, i had purchased a few pairs of sexy panties for my girlfriend. i had them all, i thought, safely stuffed into my jacket pocket. however, one must've slipped loose when i left for work that morning, because when i came home i found my wife sitting on the couch with the most furious look on her face and one of the pairs of panties sitting on the coffee table. my wife just looked at me as i looked down at them then slowly stalked off to our bedroom. 

i don't know why the idea came to me, but it hit me as soon as she left the room and i knew i had to act immediately and that i had to be quick and silent. thankfully, my girlfriend had been out sick at work and i still had the other two pairs of panties in my jacket pocket. 

quick as a flash and quiet as a ninja, i stepped out of my shoes and dropped my trousers. then i whipped off my boxers and stuffed them under the couch. then i squeezed my big ass into one of the pairs of panties, yanked my trousers back up and stepped back into my shoes. 

it was honestly impressive. i bet i got undressed and redressed in all of five seconds before i was headed up the stairs after my wife. 

i found her sitting on the bed, still looking furious. i said, in my most soothing tone, ""honey, it's not what it looks like.""

then i dropped my pants and let my wife see me, her six foot fall husband, in little pink panties as if i had been wearing them from the moment i walked in the door. 

we had a long talk after that. my wife was confused, and a little hurt, that i'd never confessed my supposed fetish to her, but it was minor compared to the fury of earlier. in the end, she was perfectly accepting of it and encouraged me to continue to do so if it made me happy, but never to hide it from her and to not let our children know. 

so, that's why i wear panties to work every day now. fuck my life. ",11
"i cut myself last night to try and relieve the nagging nerve pain i've had for years and it worked.. conflicted i've had crushed discs and a cyst on my spine for about 10 years now. on the daily, the pain is manageable, but when it flares up, i have nagging, burning pain in my hip, down the front of my calf, and into my ankle. i tried to get in to see my doctor yesterday, but he's out of town. i have an appointment on monday. heat and ice didn't help. stretching didn't help.

it felt like if i could just reach the area inside my leg that hurt and press on it, the pain would go away. i was so desperate. i'm so, so tired of this pain. so i took a small blade, found the most painful point, and inserted it in my leg. it didn't hurt at all to do and the relief was instantaneous. the nerve pain went away from that point down. i could still feel it higher on my leg, so i made another cut. i made a total of seven. it feels like i can reach the area that hurts now. i don't want the holes to close because then i won't be able to reach the spots to make them stop hurting.

i know i shouldn't have done this. i've never purposely injured myself before. i'm just really tired.",11
"when i was 21, nobody showed up to my birthday party at the bar that i rented out. first off, i'm a guy and i still think about this today and it makes me cringe inside thinking about it. it was sort of a low point for me personally and it makes me wary of the choices i make moving forward.

**backstory:**

back when i was 20, i was pretty popular or so i thought, i had big groups of friends but not one best friend. i had what i thought great relationships with people and i was the type of guy to be there for you. i was always going out to friends birthdays, meet ups and seeing them before they'd go out to college etc. basically, i was a stand out guy and was loyal to the bone. if you needed me to pick you up out of jail at 2 in the morning, i was the guy to call, i had your back.

**story about the night:**

that night, i had reservations from a friend who knew the bar owner, they had their own personal bar in the back and they told me i could rent it out for free. i thought great, this room is pretty big and has enough tables to sit about 35 people. i had personally invited 30-40 people a week prior and was excited about the aspect of seeing all of my friends and just getting completely wasted with them. party was to start at 10 so i decided it's probably a good idea to get there a little late to make an entrance. 

around 10:30 i get there, music is blasting but the backroom is completely empty. the bartender asks me where my friends are at and i told them they all must be running late, trying to laugh it off with her. i stood by the bar staring at my phone, i got a couple of texts from people saying they'd be late or cancelling last minute. around 11:30 rolls around, still nobody and i can see the bartender feeling bad for me, offering me free drinks throughout the night. i felt completely embarrassed and stupid just standing there alone on my birthday thinking i had all these great friends. around 12:30, still nobody, not one person has texted me since, so around 1:15 i tell them forget it i'm going home. the bartender put her hand on my shoulder and told me to forget them and know who my real friends are. i held back my tears standing in that dark empty room, feeling drunk and completely humiliated. so many mixed emotions went through my head but mostly embarrassed and betrayed. i went outside and called a cab and cried in the back on my way home. i got to my place and just sat on the bathroom floor for an hour that night, crying my eyes out like a little kid. friends asked me about my birthday the following day but i didn't even respond to them.

i've gotten over it because i'm 26 now. its still a hard thing to think about and muster. it's really effected the way i've chosen friends to keep close, my trust in people's words have been completely broken unless they've been able to prove otherwise. i really don't expect anything out of anyone, and when they do i'm really caught off guard. it's something i hope nobody ever has to go through. 

i've never felt more alone then that night.

**tldr- invited tons of friends to my 21st birthday party, not one person shows up.**

edit. i didn't think i'd be getting this sort of response. i'll try to respond individually if i can, stuck at work at the moment. i'm reading all your comments, i'm sorry to all the people that this happened to because honestly, it's one of the most gut wrenching feelings to go through. 

even though this happened 5 years ago, it's still something that my scumbag brain likes to remind me of when i'm having a great day. would not recommend.",11
"i can't go to my barbershop anymore because i'm a liar. so today i went to get a haircut. when you get there you have to write your name down so they can call you. while i was sitting there on my phone, a barber had apparently been calling my name a few times until i finally looked up and said ""sorry, i didn't hear you"" then as i went to go sit in his chair i heard the other barbers and some customers laughing, i felt really embarrassed and dumb, it's already hard enough being in a place with so many people. so as i'm getting the haircut i kept thinking about what i should say to the barber so he doesn't think i'm an idiot who doesn't respond to his own name. so after he as done with the haircut i said ""sorry i didn't hear you earlier, i have a hearing problem"" and as soon as i said it i saw the guilt on his face which made me feel guilty too because i was lying. so long story short, i can't go to that barbershop anymore because it's associated with a nasty lie and i can't keep pretending to have a hearing problem. it's a shame because they're the best barbers in my area and they're cheap.

"wanted: new confessors. reddit needs to confess but they can't if they don't know we exist.. the way to fix that is by upvoting this post to the front page so non subscribers find out about /r/confession . i gain no karma out of it. this is entirely just to promote the sub.

i've seen this sub liberate a man from an abusive relationship. i've seen it stop a person from killing themselves. i've seen it give sound advice to a recently raped woman. there's potential here beyond just confessions. 

imagine what can be solved if the more people knew about it. if you're new to /r/confession then go in and read some top posts from here(http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/top/?sort=top&t=week)

"i've been in a relationship with an older man for over a decade that started when i was a minor. i need help.. this is a throwaway account for what i assume will be obvious reasons. this will be an epic post. it's taken me almost 13 years to tell this story to anyone.

when i was 15 i joined an online community. i used it to vent about typical teenage-angsty topics: family, friends, school, etc. i should be clear it wasn't specifically geared toward teens and actually i think the majority of users were in their 20s and older. 

on this site i ""met"" a man in his late 20's who i will refer to as adam. adam and i got to know each other over the course of a few months via long chats and emails. we ended up in a virtual relationship. by this i mean i considered him my boyfriend. he considered me his girlfriend. this relationship included cyber sex, but we never sent each other sexy pictures until i was over 18. we both knew this was legally wrong but of course i was 15 and didn't care. i don't remember what his justification was. i thought he was my soul mate.

adam was absolutely my first love. during our ""relationship"" he would write epic poems and essays about his love for me and how wonderful i was. it was stuff that even now (i am now in my late 20s) i would find incredibly romantic and beautiful if it were in an appropriate context. we called each other our soul mates. we planned for our futures together, including children's names. it was an intense relationship by any definition, but especially for a 15 year old girl.

eventually we ""broke up"" after almost a year because he found out i was dating someone in real life. he said i broke his heart. he was devastated. i was devastated that i had hurt him.

the years passed and even though we were no longer ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" we never stopped talking. i always considered him one of my best friends. i grew up, dated other guys, graduated high school, went to and graduated from college, eventually got married and even had a baby. he meanwhile met another woman online, moved in with her, and has been married to her for several years. during this time we go through cycles of getting close, declaring our love for each other, making promises to be together, then getting frustrated and drifting apart. this has been going on for almost 13 years. i'm exhausted.

i've also tried to meet him several times over the years (after i turned 18) but any time we got close he would fall through. the most recent time was early 2016. we live in different states and had planned to meet halfway. i arrived at our meeting spot, several hundred miles away from home, and he chickened out. told me he couldn't come, couldn't make an excuse to his wife that she would believe. then he stopped answering my phone calls. i was furious, embarrassed, and devastated. i thought that was the end of our relationship but somehow we moved past it and continued our friendship/relationship/cycle of codependency. 

so why am i now writing this? why now, after 13 years of this cycle of on-again, off-again? i think i'm just tired. i had a baby not too long ago with my husband who, despite everything i've said here, i dearly love and cherish. i recognize that my relationship with adam is destroying my ability to be intimate with him and with other people. i'm just so used to keeping this secret. in all my friendships/relationships in the pas 13 years i have never told anyone about adam. he has always been a secret. at first it was to protect him and then later i think because i was just ashamed.

tonight i decided i have to stop the cycle. i contacted a therapist and i'm going to tell her what i've told you all. i hope this is the beginning of a new, healthier chapter.

thanks for listening.",11
"i quit my job because people are gross. gross, don't read if gross body stuff and roaches make you queasy. so i loved my job as a pest control tech. i had so much fun helping people with their problems. well one day i was working at an apartment complex. this complex is in a college town so it was mostly students. well i am about 14 apartments in when i go into an apartment. there were some clothes on the floor. not to dirty. i find roach droppings in the living room. i was unhappy about that as it meant i needed to really lay the boric acid down. its just time consuming and i wanted to get home for a date night with my wife.

well i start finding roaches so i start killing and removing them with a shot vac. 
ok, so there are pictures of the person living in this apartment. she is a smoking hot girl. i mean hot hot. of course she has photos of herself everywhere.

so from the kitchen i go and eradicate in the living room. then the bathroom, and finally her bedroom. i walk in and theres clothes everywhere. pants, shirts, jackets, underwear, etc. so i'm killing and vacuuming. out of the corner of my eye i see movement. i look and see a big american roach. its on a white nightstand drawer. i run over to get it with the vac but it goes into the drawer. without even thinking i open the drawer to get him.

well, the drawer is filled with roaches and sex toys. yup, sex toys and they weren't cleaned very well. they had dry vaginal fluid i suspect on them. they were covered with roaches eating the dry flakes on the toys. there were dirty buttplugs as well. while that bothered me it was the smell that knocked me for a loop. i have pulled dead rotten animals out of 100+ degree attics and this smelled worse. i threw up in my mouth. ran towards the bathroom hitting the door frame with my shoulder. i hit it so hard i fell back sideways and then ran into the bathroom.

 after throwing up everything i ever ate. i went back in and vacuumed up the roaches but dust around the table. not on the toys because that would be bad and gross(sarcasm). 
i didn't go home after work. nope i went to the emergency room because my shoulder turned purple and hurt like crazy. fortunately it was just a bad bruise.

i lost my stomach for my work and called in sick for 2 days. then quit. i never told anyone why. never told anyone about the gross hot girl. now i kind of regret it and miss it. oh well. 
seriously wash your sex toys, you don't want to get sick.

edit: wow so that's what its like to have your inbox killed. sorry for not warning that its gross. i will add that now. also paragraphs!
tl dr: loved my job. went into a gross apartment and got hurt.

"remorse i cheated on a project inadvertently caused half my class to fail, and got away with an a. this was over a decade ago when i was a freshman in college studying computer science. it was second semester and there was a large project that people broke off into pairs or groups to work on.

i paired up with another guy, and we both slacked off quite a bit. it was maybe a week before the due date of the project when i asked an acquaintance if i could see his code for the project to get a better understanding of how to do it. i ended up copying/pasting almost the whole thing while only changing variable names for the most part. dumb, i know, but it was crunch time and i was desperate.

everyone turns in their project work and we end up taking our final exam. at the beginning of the exam the professor asks for a laundry list of people to come speak to him after they complete the exam including myself and my partner. turns out over half the class (20+ people) ended up doing the same thing - but here's the kicker - my partner shared our code with another group who in turn shared it with yet another and so on. half the class turned in code that i originally copied from one group and we were all in trouble.

my partner didn't know where i got the code from and thought i wrote it and apologized profusely for sharing it and took the fall. half the class failed because of this including the group i originally copied the code from. because my partner took complete responsibility, the professor and the dean of the department asked me to provide a statement so they could add it to the case which i did. i was absolved of any wrongdoing and received an a for the project while everyone else failed and had to retake the class next semester. the guy who i originally copied the code from knew what was up and hated me afterward but couldn't do anything about it until it was far too late and the case was shut.",11
"i say i'm losing weight for my own good. actually i want to look hot so i can have sex easier. i feel kinda crap about this. but i just want to look hot.

"i scared and confused a man at whole foods by fabricating a bizarre lie for no reason.. light

i've never confessed here before so if this sort of submission is frowned upon, please expunge this post with impunity.

**tldr**: i (seemed to) make a man doubt his own sanity and leave whole foods in a panic because of a little off-the-cuff storytelling. i feel bad about it.

this happened last night. conversation is paraphrased but largely word-by-word accurate, as i've been replaying it in my mind frequently since.

**brief backstory**: i'm a 20-something guy who does a little improv and a lot of dm-ing for a couple of d&d groups. i'm also blind in one eye and have amblyopia (said eye wanders occasionally). i try to live a good life guided by kindness and conscience, to various levels of success.

**the situation**: walking home from work, i get a call from my girlfriend. she is running late to a book club and frantically asks if i can pick her up some snacks from whole foods. she intends to do a drive-by in a lyft and pick up those snacks. she's very appreciative, and i happy to do it.

i grab a cart, do the rounds, buy her snacks, and get in line to checkout. directly behind me is an older man, maybe mid-fifties. we exchange pleasantries about the snow. i get a text from the girlfriend and hustle the snacks out to her. the lyft parks her a full block away, and with the snow, running them to her takes a few minutes.

here, i think to myself ""well i may as well not waste a trip"" and go back to the store to shop for my weekly groceries. i retrieve a second cart, and then i see him. the older man coming out of the adjacent (but separate) liquor store. he spots me in the stores' shared lobbies. i catch his gaze, and to my surprise, he approaches me.

**the incident**: with a curious smile on his face, the man asks, ""this will sound strange, but didn't i just see you checking out? can i ask why you're going back in with an empty cart?""

my initial instincts are an amused appreciation for his curiosity and an aching nuisance about explaining the situation in all its longwinded mundanity (as i've subjected you all to now). i'm tempted for a minute to simply explain, but something takes hold of me. like he who answers the call of the void, i begin to speak, only half in control of my actions.

i smile reassuringly and respond ""sir, your watch appears to be out of synch.""

he is still smiling his good-natured midwestern old guy smile, ""what?"" he puzzles.

""your watch."" i reiterate, still smiling myself. i lean in a bit. ""it appears to be out of synch."" i lean on those last words a bit coyly.

the man puzzles at me, and looks down at his watch, then back at me. ""what? didn't i just see you?""

i breathe a single-burst chuckle, ""of course sir. we've seen each other lots of times."" i leave my cart and walk a step toward him, lowering my voice. ""your watch. it *appears to be out of synch*.""

the man now is just staring with a furrowed brow. i want to stop. i think part of me thought he would just write me off as a loon and walk away. but something in his expression urged me to continue.

i continued in a light hush, ""sir, you ought not worry about this. we've had this conversation before. i suppose that we'll have it again. the airport? the dental clinic? maybe you remember these too--sometimes you do, sometimes you don't. i urge you to adjust your watch.""

the man, to his credit, scrunches into a frown here and parries. ""what in the hell are you talking about, my watch?""

i stare at him intently. ""think a moment sir. the time on the boats, perhaps. i'm the man with the bad eye. i know you noticed. you're the man with the old watch. haven't you seen me before, now that you think of it?""

his mouth opens a little bit, and he does seem to think a moment. against my expectation he begins to look genuinely scared. again, i want to stop but don't.

""we need to meet like this, from time to time. but it needn't be so distressing for you. your watch is fast, sir. set it back a few minutes. and don't dawdle. i'm already later than i ought to be.""

then i check my own watch. flinch into a frown, and press past him. i abandon my cart and head for the exit. ""see you next time,"" i call back, almost drowsily.

the man follows me out onto the sidewalk and calls out ""hey now, wait!"" there is obvious terror in his voice. but i keep walking with speed. my heart is racing and as i cross the street, the man disappears behind snow-swirl and bus traffic.

**my conscience**: i hope he has a story about a crazy person he met at whole foods. i fear he has a slow-building psychosis founded upon conspiracy.

"i have a girlfriend and a daughter, and i'm terrified.. **edit:** oh wow, i truly wasn't expecting this when i posted it. i was just feeling so...i don't even know what, and i just wrote away. i want you guys to know that i'm truly blown away by these comments and advices, and i wish i could answer all of you. thank you so much for all the kind words, the gold, the advices and the heartwarming pms. i haven't told marion about this post yet, but i certainly told our baby, she of course just looked at me confused but it's our secret for now.

---

i don't know what this is, i don't know if it's a confession or a love letter or both, but for the first time, i'm terrified of everything. every little thing poses a danger and i know it's not true, but i'm so scared of losing what i have now that logic doesn't work with my brain, it seems.

i'm a 28 year old male. 

when i was young i fell for one of my dearest friends. we sort of grew up together, and then we dated and it didn't work out. i thought she'd forever be the love of my life. then, i met another girl and while i loved her, it wasn't the same thing. we dated for a long while and then broke up. i tried giving it another shot with my friend, but there were complications from both our sides. both of these relationships were long and while i've had hookups here and there, i'm the kind of guy who enjoys being in a relationship.

so i spent a good time alone. from 26 to 27. i'm still friends with both my ex-girlfriends and occasional hookups with them would happen, but i never went back to dating either of them. 

then i met her. i'll call her marion here. she came into my life out of nowhere--we met at around 4 am when we both went out to the same convenience store. i remember seeing her grabbing a box of cereal next to me, and i couldn't stop staring. she was gorgeous, the kind of gorgeous you need to tell yourself not to drop your jaw. her hair goes down to her waist, and she's got these hazel eyes that are cat like and that day she was wearing a black dress with a black robe over it,  a black robe full of pink roses and i know i'm sounding stupid, but i was just attracted to her for some reason, like she was pulling me in. i stared like a dumbass and she noticed and sort of laughed, shook her head and stepped in front of me to grab the box she wanted. i told her without thinking that i liked those cereals, too, and i think i cringed at that but she was nice about it. she started talking to me, and we paid for our stuff and sat on the parking lot there, eating cereal right out of the box. that's one of my favorite memories with her because it looks like a scene out of a movie or a book and it was the first time we met. we exchanged numbers and over the weeks, we started talking more and more. by the end of the first month of our friendship, i was completely and utterly infatuated with her, and luckly for me, she was too. we started dating and i fell in love with her so quickly and so hard. you ever met someone that seems to have been made especially for you? we fit together. it's the best way i can explain it, we fit together. even when we fight, even when we're mad at each other, this entire relationship still feels right. 

so things progressed and she got pregnant. it was an accidental pregnancy. right when the symptoms started to show, we both knew what it meant. we were terrified, and i went to buy a pregnancy test with her. when that thing turned out to be positive, we were still terrified but happy, too. some people were really against it, some talked about us being young. i was about to turn 28 then, she was 24. we had already decided on keeping the baby and nothing anyone said made any difference. we moved in together, and had a healthy baby.

and now here we are, and the reason i'm here is because i realized last night how scared i am. it was raining really hard, and the baby was crying. marion got up to go see what it was, guessing that the baby was hungry. i couldn't go back to sleep, so i went to the nursery where she usually breastfeeds the baby, but they weren't there. i then went to the living room and found marion sitting by the window, watching the rain, breastfeeding our baby girl. she was wearing a similar robe to when we first met, and she looked stunning. the room was quiet except for the sound of the rain, and it was honestly the most beautiful thing i've ever seen and it was mine, you know, my family. i quietly made my way to them and sat in front of her. she smiled at me and put her feet on my lap, and we stayed like that until our daughter was done feeding. and i realized that i could lose this, i could lose this as quickly as i gained it and that thought made me go numb. i love that woman more than anything, i love our daughter more than anything, i love us, i love our story and i want to protect them from everything and the fact that i can't is making me go insane. i get anxious when she's out and takes too long to come home because i think something happened, i get these intrusive thoughts all the time. my confession is that i think i'm experiencing real love even though i thought i'd loved before and i have a tendecy to lose people i love. i'm truly scared here and i don't know how to keep that anxiety down. it might be because we're parents now, but even before our baby i was terrified of losing marion. 

i wish i could predict every danger in the world to keep them away from it.",11

"i have a micropenis.. remorse: if you feel bad 

i have a micropenis. my penis is about 2.5"" erect. i've never told anyone about it. i don't want anyone to know. they will think that i am less of a man. at the very least they will pity me, which is even worse.

i'm not overweight or anything like that, it's just the way it is. i'm a virgin, never done anything with a girl. i'm average in terms of looks. i'm short but girls show interest occasionally/rarely. i'm scared to do anything. i'm 19 and in college, so everyone around me is having sex all the time and i have to just feign laughter as guys tell me that they ""fucked this really hot girl last night."" it's great. i've known that my penis was small since i was 13/14, but i assumed that it would grow eventually. it didn't.

i've read just about every single article, study and forum post about micropenises and the consensus is that women don't get pleasure from penetrative sex at all. in movies you see the two main characters get together and it's very romantic, they kiss and start to have sex, they're both moaning and loving it. it seriously breaks my heart to know that i'll never be able to give a woman that experience. i know that i can learn to give cunnilingus (and i've read a lot on the topic), but it's just not the same. women talk about being ""filled up"" like its the most amazing feeling in the world. it hurts to know that i can't provide that feeling. i've tried to kill myself before. i broke into a building and was standing on the roof about to jump, but i just couldn't do it. i stayed there for hours trying to find the balls to do it, but apparently they're small too.

i hate it so much. the thought of a woman laughing at me when the clothes come off is terrifying. very few women would accept a man with a micropenis and even if there was a woman who could she would always think about a guy who was larger. penetrative sex is off the table so she would probably seek it elsewhere. i know i probably sound like a whiny little bitch, and i most likely am, but it just really fucking sucks.

**edit**: i apologize for the fragmented writing, my thoughts are quite jumbled.

**edit2**: thanks for all of the replies. people are misquoting and misunderstanding the things that i say, so i'm pretty much done commenting. i realise that when something like this is posted, all the magical optimistic fairies come in and say that the world is a beautiful place. but thinking that the majority of women are going to be okay with a 2.5"" penis is delusional. genuinely delusional. especially 19 year olds.

i may have exaggerated by saying that it is one of the main elements of masculinity. when i said it i was mainly referring to height. which many studies support. 

are there some who will accept it, absolutely. i guess, i just need to find them.

"i killed my grandma with a prank and nobody knows. the year was 2012 and i was 18 years old. i had moved out of my parents house and was living 3 hours north of my family. i got a girlfriend for the first time and i told my family all about her on the phone. my grandma was a super nice christian woman. i loved her to death and i struggle every day knowing what i did. obviously with her christian beliefs i should be waiting till marriage to have sex and she told me that growing up but i didn't really hear much about it anymore after i got to around the age of 12. so one day i got this bold idea to prank my grandma. i called her on the phone and asked her to please be patient with me and not to speak out of anger once i tell you what happened. then i proceeded to explain to her than my girlfriend was pregnant followed by choking sounds on her end and i instantly knew i had messed up. i hung up the phone after calling her name for 2 minutes and called my dad who rushed over to her house to find her laying cold on the basement floor. to this day nobody knows what we talked about on the phone and everybody is happy for me because i was able to have a conversation with her right before she passed. they tell me to stay positive and to know that she didn't die alone. she passed from an unexpected heart attack. kill me god.

"i put my ex boss's phone number and email on craigslist, asking for as many dick-pics as possible.. she would never let us eat anything. no breaks. no lunch breaks. wanna eat? gotta eat and work. couldn't drink anything there but water. she screwed me around on my pay. overworked me for $7.25 an hour. 

so i decided to get a little revenge. i did it right before i quit. she got so many, she had to change her number and email. she still has no idea who did it.",11
"my cum tissue turned into a ant nest. okay so i sometimes jerk off in bed, i put it into a tissue and toss it into a corner of my room. and i get it the next day. but i forgot for 2 days and its just starting to get hot out. so about 10 minutes ago i went to get it. and i went to pick it up and i was just fucking shocked. their was 200 little fucking ants using my cum rag as a goddamn nest. they ate my semen and used it as a nest......

"i turned in my friend for animal abuse. no regrets my friend is a real piece of shit. he lives in a crowded house that he doesn't take care of. there's no room to even walk. he has a dog that he keeps in a kennel 24/7 and then gets pissed off when she has accidents on the carpet. when she does, he will pick her up by the neck and hit her. he will sometimes not feed her or get her dog food because he complains about spending money on anything other than his piece of shit truck. he's so cruel to her and i don't feel bad about turning him in at all. i hope someone takes that dog away so she can actually have a nice loving home.",11
"i called the cops on a party because i wasn't invited. all my friends were going to this party. i've never really been to a drinking party at the time and the guy who hosted it thought i was a druggy and would drink too much but in actuality i'm nervous around people and wouldn't have even drank and i'm scared to do drugs. so i called as a neighbor saying they were being loud and there was underage drinking happening. close friends who ditched me to go party said it got busted 30 minutes in and the host got in big trouble with his parents. no regrets.

edit: i would never do this again just thought it would be funny and revengeful at the time. i used to be a lil bitch lol",11
"i found and read my dad's journals... ok sorry if the formating or spelling bad, i'm on my phone and just had to get this out there, i've been upset since this happened.

well it started innocent enough, i was looking for our picture albums. i want to make him a little scrapbook for fathers day.. anyways, i found a couple of boxes he had stuffed away in his closet. so i guess curiosity isn't always a good thing this time. i opened one of the boxes and of course started reading. 

and the one i read made me both angry and sad. apparently, when i was younger (5yrs old or so), someone from either school or around town, called child protective services on my dad. he never mentioned this to me and all i was told, is that these people just want to make sure ""we were safe and doing ok"" now, my dad raised me pretty much alone, my mom passed when i was very young, and i never really knew here. i will say my dad isn't a ""normal"" looking dad (especially back then). what i mean i guess is he's the tough tattooed looking guy, like you'd think is more likely to see him in a fight rather than playing outside with a 5yr old girl.. 

i know most people (still) judge him as soon as the see him, but once you get to know him, well not even that, just talk to him and you'll see he's the kindest guy you'll know. 

anyways, in his journal he wrote about cps coming for weekly, then monthly check ups and the case worker always seemed worried him about some little something they found ""odd"" in the house (like omg he left some dangerous looking tools out in the garage).  when he started writing about making changes to start looking like a ""dad"", my heart broke. he wrote about why and when he cut his hair short because of it and even looked into tattoo removal (which he couldn't afford, thank god, i love his tattoos he's told me the story of each and everyone), he even tried as he put it ""dress more classy"". trying to prove to these people that he was a good dad. 

but, none of this worked, cps still came by (from what i tell, they stopped when i 10 or 11yrs old or so).  he wrote about time that if i did any little thing wrong in class teachers always questioned his parenting, telling him things like ""he wouldn't be able to raise a daughter properly, he should find a woman""... 

the times he tried to participate with the pta or help on field trips or whatever and he was always rejected. i hate, hate how they acted towards him and it breaks my heart. he's never talked about this to me, or even let if show that he was uncomfortable when i did school activities. there's more in these journals but that's enough for now, that's my confession.",11
"i am dying and have told nobody.  this might be somewhat long, but i basically just made this reddit account to talk about it. some introductions, first, i'm 22/m and for the greater part of a year i had noticed myself growing gradually weaker. i am an avid golfer who used to be able to hit drives upwards of 290-300 yards, now i'm lucky to hit it 220-230. in addition, i am also someone who used to enjoy jogging, until multiple repetitive falls more or less forced me to quit. there are other symptoms that raised concern but i won't bore anyone with the extensive details. at any rate, about six months i had my initial consultation with my neurologist and he was very dismissive of my symptoms, saying they were likely caused by anxiety and to not read further into it. after some protest on my part, he acquiesced and agreed to perform some diagnostic testing in a few months if nothing had improved.

four months go by, and, of course, things got worse. perplexed, my neurologist ordered an emg, which, if you did not know, is a test which involves measuring the activity of nerves in the body through the use of needle electrodes. sounds awful, truly was not that bad. as the test began, the technician was very amicable and talkative, but as soon as the first needle went into my arm, her demeanor changed immediately, as if any levity had suddenly been drained from her. that was the first time i began to truly worry. upon completing the test she immediately sent the results to my neurologist, who, that very same day, arranged for additional testing including, but not limited to: mri, extensive neurological exam, strength tests, and an additional emg, the whole shebang, to be completed within the week. 

at any rate, following the completion of the second emg, this time by my neurologist himself, i was summoned into his office. after jotting down some quick notes and doing some mental aerobics, he asked very politely for me to sit down, and before the words even left his mouth i immediately knew what was going to come out. and that's essentially the story of how i went from being a perfectly 'normal' 22 yo to being told that i had lou gehrig's disease and 3-5 years of life left.

all things considered, i consider myself extremely fortunate that i still have most of faculties about me, for the time being. but onto the reason i made this post, since my diagnosis, which was about two months ago, (12/28/16), i have yet to tell anyone in person about it. my family and i have never been particularly close and most of my friends are college buddies who now live close to 500 miles away. of course, everyone is bound to find out eventually, but i would honestly be okay if they never did. the mere thought of burdening everyone as i slowly turn into furniture is almost more debilitating than the knowledge that my body is growing slightly more useless everyday. i know it is the right choice to garner a support system, but it's almost as if i don't really want one. i just want to disappear, forgotten by all those who would otherwise pity my circumstances. i'm fully aware that i have no choice in the matter, this is just my way of exercising some minor control over my life before i lose control over everything else.

"i gave my mom a good rating on rate my professors. no regrets

she's been having a very hard time lately and feels burnt out. i looked her up on rate my professors and saw she didn't have any reviews, so i gave her an excellent one in case she ever finds it. i may be a bit biased though.

love ya, mom.

"unpopular opinions are not a confession. please stop posting them here.. hey everyone,

this has always been a rule we've had trouble with, but i just removed an influx of unpopular opinion posts and wanted to restate that we do not consider unpopular opinions a confession here at /r/confession. i don't care if you believe abortion should be outlawed, hate black people, hate new genders people come up with, don't get along with women, or think that trump/theresa may/kim jong un is a good leader. there are other subreddits you can post that sort of content to (try /r/unpopularopinions, for example), but this is not the place. our official rule is, ""we don't believe in thoughtcrime, here. your thoughts, feelings, preferences, misunderstandings, or opinions are not a confession. everyone is allowed to like or dislike different things.""


*so, what exactly is your definition of a confession, then?*

a confession is defined here as: (1) an acknowledgement or admission of wrongdoing on your part; or (2) a statement admitting that you are personally guilty of a wrongdoing.

the word wrongdoing implies that there is an element of action to your confession -- you cheated on your husband, you stand outside abortion clinics and protest, you secretly call your friend the wrong pronouns behind their back, you know you're not supposed to say the n-word but you do it anyways, you had sex with your cousin, etc. part of what makes this subreddit so exciting is hearing about the actual *things* that people have done, not listening to someone rant about whatever topic they don't feel comfortable talking about in real life. if something didn't happen, then it is not a confession. 

please refrain from posting them here and report these types of posts so that they can be removed more quickly. i am happy to answer any questions or address any concerns pertaining to this rule.


have a wonderful rest of your day and happy confessing!",11
"i 21 f hid my daughter from her father 21 m, my ex, with help from his mom. 4 years ago, i dated a guy for 2 years. we were really in love, best friends, all of that. we broke up after a nasty fight my sophomore year of college that was fueled from our frustrations of being long distance. his mother detested me because her husband had died a few years back and he was her only son, and i guess she thought i wasn't good enough. she always made this very clear, and one of the issues my ex and i had was him not noticing or defending me.

a couple of years ago, my ex came to our hometown and all my old friends met up. we were mutually surprised to see each other, and it was very clearly an odd and tense situation. everyone got drunk, ex started talking to me, then we were laughing, then we started making out and had sex in our friend's guest room. super drunk, no condom. i barely remembered when i woke up and just dipped out of there.

a month later i'm still pretty messed up because i still loved him and that encounter made it worse, and i realize i'm late on my period but hadn't noticed because i had been so distraught. took a test, so surprised when it was positive i fainted. i knew we wouldn't work out as a couple, no matter how much i still loved him. i wanted the best for him- i wanted him to find a girl to be happy himself with and finish school and be successful (he was really going places) and not have to move back home to be with his kid. i loved him so much i just wanted the best. couldn't bring myself to get an abortion. so after three months when it really hit me that i probably wasn't going to lose it, i did what i thought was the best thing to do. i went to his mom.

his mom was very wary opening the door. faked a smile all that, tried to politely ask what i was doing there. i told her i was pregnant with her son's kid, and that we wanted the same thing for him. i told her i wouldn't get an abortion, but ex didn't have to know. she was real quiet, asked why i was willing to do this. i said i couldn't tell him because i didn't want to get back in a relationship knowing he wasn't happy with his life, and i didn't want to fuck it up. so i told her i wanted to move away to detroit, where some of my extended family was, and cut everyone except immediate family from back home off. that i wanted to basically drop off the grid, delete everything, disappear and raise my kid. so we made a deal. she would pay child support and rent (she is very wealthy and was very willing to keep this secret) and i would continue to go to school. i remember the last thing she told me was ""thank you for doing what's best for my son. i never knew you loved him this much."" really fucks to think about now.

i went home and cried, then eventually broke the news to my parents and my plan. they were absolutely against it, so i promised to stay long enough for the birth, but i had to leave after, this was my life. i think part of the reason my dad allowed it was because i would be living off campus and they wouldn't have to pay rent, and it would be a lot less money for them. my mom only allowed because she visited her family in detroit often and she always thought my ex didn't treat me right (that wasn't quite true, though)

flash forward and i have left school, i'm at home, social media accounts deleted, number changed. my mom keeps getting calls from my friends and tells them i have decided to start life over (the worst part was hearing some of my close friends cry, even the guys) and i couldn't ever answer the door because sometimes my friends would try to see me. my parents always said i wasn't at home/moved away. 

after the birth of my daughter i stayed for a month then moved to detroit. started working part time, took classes online, raised my kid alone. shit sucked but i made friends who didn't know me before and life was okay.

that leads to yesterday. at around 3pm i got a knock on my door, and see 6 of my old friends including my ex. i was supposed to have company over so i had actual clothes on and the apartment clean, thank god. i tried shutting the door but boy 1 stopped it and they forced themselves in. said girl 1 had been going to my parents mailbox for weeks to try and find where i was (mailing address). they found a letter i had sent my parents with pictures i had developed of my daughter (but they didn't open it, just used the address) and came. thought i was part of a cult or sick or something. boy 2 mentions a rumor that i had a kid. standing there and seeing my old best friends and the shock and knowing i was fucked just killed me and i started tearing up. cue my daughter waddling into view behind me.

i wouldn't tell them who the father was, but my ex had the strangest look like he knew. they all sat down and i brought them beers and then played with my daughter. they all seem so young now, or maybe i feel old. my daughter went up to my ex at one point, and held her hands up to be held. she hugged his neck tightly and wouldn't let go, then sat down facing him and fell asleep against his chest. my ex looked at me and i had to turn around. thought i would lose it.

later we all caught up. ex became exactly what he wanted, so maybe this was worth it. i explained i had wanted a new life for me and her, and i missed them all so much. it was late so i had ex carry her to her crib to sleep. while it was him and i in there he finally asked if she was his. i burst into tears and he knew. he was so angry, and i tried my best to explain but obviously it wasn't enough. i told him i thought it was best for him, and his mom agreed, and he started crying. i think from his yells the others knew too.

they all slept over and are still here. my ex wants to work something out. i still love him but i won't get back with him just so he can see his daughter. i told him he can visit whenever he wants, but he wants me to move to his school's area. i don't know what to do. and i'm sorry. i thought i was making the right choice and it was selfless, but now i don't know. any advice would help. 

edit: my ex and i had a scare early in our relationship and he acted poorly. kept asking me to abort it etc. he was immature then and part of the reason we broke up was because it always felt like he wasn't growing up. i didn't stay in a relationship with him/get back into one with him after finding out because it would just be him angry at me all the time for something i didn't do and bitterness towards me for ruining his life. that being said, he seems really different now. i think he might still be in love with me, and i am still in love with him, especially after seeing him with my daughter, however i won't get back into a relationship with him if our daughter is the only reason we are together and i know he doesn't truly want to be with me for me. i know it's still fucked up, but i don't think he would have been able to become successful or grow up if he had known. not saying what i did was right, just that that was my reasoning. thank you.

edit: wow, thank you so much for the gold. i don't deserve it but i appreciate it and all the support and advice and honesty, even if it was hard to read. thank you everyone

update: well, it's been about two and a half weeks since i wrote this post. my ex and my friends all left the day after but my ex went back to his moms place and had a talk with her. he apologized to me for not being the most supportive before and was still upset with me, however understood because he has seen how much he has grown. he was livid with his mom  and if she didn't have a stake on where my daughter and i currently live he said he would cut her off immediately. i am done with cutting people off so i wouldn't have let that happen regardless. i got to go home last week, and met up with a bunch of people. a lot of tears, didn't expect that, and my friends threw me a surprise coming home party. it was very overwhelming but mostly because i never knew i was so loved. my daughter seems so happy with her father and i'm in love with their relationship. my ex and i went out to dinner a few days ago just us two and although we didn't call it a date, it kinda felt like the ones we would go on as kids. that same connection is there, my goodness it's crazy. like i breathe differently with him or something. he's so much more mature now it's insane, and i feel different too. it's all been so refreshing. he even walked me to my parents door at the end of the night and kissed me on my forehead for a moment before going to his car, which is exactly what he did on our first date as teenagers. sent my stomach into flutters and everything. i'm not saying we will end up together as a couple, but it feels like that's a possibility. even if we don't he has been a fantastic father so far and definitely will be kept in my daughters life no matter what. we've met up with his mom and my parents and talked everything through. i finished out my fall semester at school and now i'm going to be spending a few months in my ex's city and weekends at home while i apply to other places closer to him. this was agreed upon because i feel it's only right for me to move closer to him after depriving him of the beginning of our daughter's life. me, my ex, my parents, and his mother are splitting financials until i finish school. everything is kinda unstable and feels weird right now, but at the same time everything feels very right. maybe it feels unsettled because i'm not used to being this content and happy? like i'm afraid something will go wrong? i don't know. maybe i did make a mistake back then, but i cant bring myself to regret anything, especially when my ex is so understanding which tells me he knows he wouldn't have been a positive person in my daughter's life before. i don't know, i think everything will be okay. money is fine, school is continuing, my kid and her father are spending so much time together, i get to see old friends again, and my ex and i are reconnecting. i can't ask for anything else and i'm so grateful. god is so good. i never deserved any of this but i'll take it gladly. finally, thank you for all your comments. i promise i read them all but it was very hard to respond in a decent amount of time with everything going on. the advice helped more than you all know, and all the comments were taken into consideration. god bless you all, and merry christmas/ happy holidays :)",11
"i used to bully a kid in high school. i sent him a sex tape of me and his ex girlfriend. he dropped out of school after that and went on to become a drug addict. i feel absolutely horrible about it and cant get over the feeling that i ruined his life.. i was a terrible kid in high school. i was sort of a stereotypical jock bully kind of guy. i specifically bullied this one kid jack, who i just... irrationally hated. i thought he was so unbelievably lame at the time, and me and my friends couldn't resist picking on him. even just thinking about it makes me cringe. he was sort of an emo/scene kid who would wear anime shirts, which made him a big target for us. 

&#x200b;

he dated a girl named jess, but apparently they broke up on really bad terms. he would write on myspace (this was a while ago) that he desperately missed her and wanted her back, and he was sorry. jess sort of became friends with our group afterwards, something i am sure jack hated. one day we got drunk together and jess was ranting about how much she disliked jack and that he was a sad pathetic person, and eventually we hooked up and our friends left. we were both sort of... idk how to describe it, in this evil, drunken mood. we decided to send a video of us having sex to jack. the worst part was that in retrospect, she actually had no real reason to hate jack, she just hated that he was 'pathetic' and 'needy'. she was a terrible person too i suppose. hanging out with us made her a bully. jack was never mean or cruel to her, she hated him because she thought he was too much of a loser. i mean what the fuck was wrong with us that we were like this??  


he responded to the video saying that he wants to speak with jess, and that was it. i told my friends what happened, they thought it was hilarious, and soon it was spread all over the school that i had sex with jess and sent the video to jack. i remember seeing jack in the hallway and i saw his face, and it literally pains me to think about it, but at the time i thought it was awesome. his face was puffy red, his chin wobbly, his eyes were red, it was clear he was crying before or maybe the sight of me made him want to cry again. we hysterically laughed at him, right to his face, and basically made fun of him by saying that we fucked his girl. 

&#x200b;

i cringe in pain at the memory of that. i literally wish jack just took out a fucking knife and jabbed us all in the throat. i cannot believe we ever thought that was an okay way to fucking treat someone. and 99% of it was just trying to make my friends laugh, trying to see just how cruel we could be to push things to extremes. i am not even sure if i can fully understand the mindset i was in, it was a sense of complete superiority and distaste for someone 'weak' like that. 

&#x200b;

jack would end up switching schools very soon after. well, first he dropped out of school, then he went to an alternative school i think? something like that. regardless, i found his facebook page maybe a year or so later. my stomach dropped. it was filled with statuses about his addiction to pills and his attempts at recovery. lots of stuff about the pain and anguish of his life and how much he struggles with mental health. its been a decade, and i still check his facebook page a lot... and its the same thing. hes now a heroin addict. he goes through bouts of recovery, then relapse, then recovery. i cannot help but feel fucking guilty. this happened right when he transferred schools. he mentioned it in his status that it happened when he left our school, that was when he got addicted to pills. he also mentioned he left his school because everyone hated him there. 

&#x200b;

i sent him a message saying how sorry i was, and that i cannot believe i ever acted the way i did, and that i apologize to the fullest for how we treated him. he left me on seen, which is understandable. 

&#x200b;

it sucks. it makes me feel terrible about this. i wish i could just... idk, do something to make up for it. and it makes me feel terrible, i went on to have a great life. i went to a good college, am married and have a 1 year old kid, i live in a nice area in a (relatively) nice house. i sometimes think i would feel better if it was the kind of trope where the bully has a hard life and the kid getting bullied ends up super successful and the bully ends up a drunken loser. but that isn't what happened. 

&#x200b;

i don't think there is anything in my entire life that i regret as much as what i did to jack. ",11
"no regrets i haven't wiped my ass since 2014. throwaway because this is my weird little secret.

basically, in mid-2014 i had a bout of baaaad gastro and i spent about a week sitting on my toilet like some kind of porcelain throned royalty. between the extreme acidity of the terrible squits i was gushing out and the three-ply paper i was attacking its aftermath with, by the end of the first day my asscheeks were raw.

day two was unbearable agony, and after my third or fourth deposit to the bank of stank i couldn't bear it anymore and went straight from the toilet to shower and sprayed my tainted taint with water. it was pure, unbridled, bliss in comparison to wiping each time, which even with three-ply felt like i was using sandpaper at that point.

so i kept doing it. i lived alone, nobody could judge me, so i took a quick shower and gently rinsed my butthole every time my gastro came knocking. some four days later, it had turned into an ingrained habit. life moved on, my shits downgraded from a 7 back to a blissful 4 on the bristol stool chart and i abdicated the porcelain throne a changed man. 

i kept washing my ass in the shower every time i took a shit, and i have honestly never felt cleaner in my life. long gone are the dingleberries. banished is the swamp ass. when i've had my salad tossed since this change, i've had compliments about the general cleanliness of my nethers. it's my private smug little secret when i talk to people, knowing that regardless of whatever else they might have over me they are very unlikely to have a cleaner asshole than mine, nor do they know the ~~power of the brown side~~ comfort that is a post shit shower.

the year is 2018. it's been about 3 and a half years since i last used toilet paper, and if i need to take a shit i and i'm out i just bank it for later deposit and hold out till i get home - thankfully though i'm very regular.

for those who are going to ask, i live in australia, and bidets do exist here but they're very rare, but they're on my to  do list because let's face it, a pre-wash never hurt anyone.

"i left my ex-husband because he tried to pimp me out. i never told this to my friends or my family, which is why all of them still give me a hard time for leaving the relationship.

i met my now ex-husband when we were teenagers and after we both graduated from college we got married. we were doing alright for the first year but halfway through the second things went downhill. my ex-husband had a plan to start his own business and spent a lot of time saving up money. a friend of his was also in the plan and he was supposed to be the co-owner. 

halfway through the process, my husband quit his job to dedicate himself to the project full time while his friend kept his job and would do most of the work from his home. the first month wasn't bad but on the second month the business was pretty much dead. since my ex was so focused on his business i was left to care for the bills and very soon i noticed that we would need to move.

i talked to my ex that the money was short and even showed him some other places that we could rent. he told me he wasn't going to because we were much closer to the business location. which was true but also was much more expensive since it was a high traffic area. i was working full time and there wasn't much i could do besides sell some stuff to pay that month's rent. 

i managed to hold on to the place for two months but there wasn't anything left that i could sell and the business had drained my ex's saving. i tried talking him out of it multiple times but he wasn't having any of it. he then started to ask me for money which spiralled into a fight where he said he would take care of the bills himself because apparently i was spending money with bullshit. 

three months later, after my ex's sold pretty much all the furniture in the apartment, i received a letter from the landlord saying that we would be out of the place because the rent was late. i showed it to my ex because i really believed he was looking for a job (which he had promised) and that all the furniture went for the rent, only to find out he was spending all the money to salvage the now dead business. 

he apologized and burst into tears. i told him to contact his family because i would call mine, just until we could find somewhere cheaper and build ourselves back up. he immediately started screaming that he was the leader and he already had a plan. he told me to go take a shower and put on my best lingerie because he was going to call the landlord. apparently, the landlord had already said that he would give us more time if i had sex with him a few times and my ex agreed to it.

i left that same night and went to a friend's house. to everyone who asked i would say that i left him because i didn't love him anymore (which is partially true). i sent the divorce papers two weeks later and he signed the same day he received. last i heard of him he was living with another friend of his. the friend who was his co-owner jumped out of the boat 3 weeks after because he got a promotion.

i live now by myself and due to me working my ass off to get the money while i was married, i got a promotion as well.

"i faked a customer compliment to get myself a raise at work. i worked at a fast food restaurant for 7 years. i started working there at 14 and was part of the original staff when the store opened. i was really good at my job and worked well with the customers. nothing good i ever did was recognized, whether it was going above and beyond helping customers or constantly filling in for other staff when the store needed it, i felt under appreciated and my boss's were dicks. at this point i was 5 years in and not even a raise. i was one of two original staff still left. i saw an old couple come in and i made a plan. i went out of my way to give them the best service possible. even served them at their table like a sit down restaurant. after the very happy old couple left i went to our website where people would write complaints to head office. instead of a complaint i pretended to be the elderly man and gave myself a rave review to head office. i even noted the time they came in and saved a receipt to prove the validity of the comment. two days later i come into work and see my well worded compliment posted on the back board with some nice comments from head office and my boss gave me a raise. sometimes you gotta look out for yourself.

"i prostituted myself for netflix.. (this requires a bit of a backstory, but i included a tl;dr)

this happened two years ago, when i was 19. i was single at the time, and most definitely ready to mingle. i had just moved to paris and pretty much had 0 contacts with anyone there. so i downloaded tinder. after a few days, i end up matching with this person, and we decide to meet each other later that night.

everything goes pretty well, and eventually things end up at my place. they ask me if i'm down for a movie on netflix, which i absolutely was. except i don't have netflix, which i shamefully let them know.
""that's alright, we can use mine.""
and so we did, and of course fifteen minutes in, the movie was paused, because, well, you see, when two people like each other... they fuck.

now i'll be honest, and this is important, the sex was definitely not the most enjoyable i've had, for reasons i'll spare. so the morning after, they leave and i don't see them again for quite some time (ooh foreshadowing).

in the weeks that follow, the person messages me to let me know they are interested in fooling around again. which i awkwardly decline for made up reasons, because i couldn't bring myself to tell them they weren't a very good sexual partner. one thing they were good at however, was not noticing that they had left their netflix open on my laptop, and that i had been using it (a lot) this whole time, until my laptop breaks, and i have to buy a new one.

now, i'm sure you're beginning to connect the dots here. no, i no longer had netflix. and yes, i was very keen on getting it again. so after about two months, i message that person to let them know that i'm interested in seeing them again. they are a bit surprised, naturally, but accept my invitation.

i was really hoping that they would want to watch netflix again, so i wouldn't have to be the one to ask, which could have blown my cover. luckily, they did. everything is going according to plan. what follows is perhaps the weirdest i've felt during sex, i wanted it over with (and ironically, it was still better than the first time). but it was well worth it.

fast forward three weeks, and i accidentally erase my history/cookies, and lose their netflix again. i prostituted myself for three weeks of netflix. i hope that's at least $10.


tl;dr: tinder date uses their netflix on my computer. sex is bad. i change computer and need their netflix again. ring ring booty call. i sleep with them despite it not being very good and get their netflix again for an entire 3 weeks. woo.

edit: i am a guy, tinder date was a girl. (i wanted to keep gender anonimity but i'm getting creepy messages)

edit 2: i am both pleasantly and unpleasantly surprised that reddit does not care what gender you are, you will receive creepy messages regardless.",11
"made everyone on the office sick - on purpose. i worked in a law office for absolutely horrible attorneys. it was the most miserable place i have ever worked. i had the flu, complete with a 102° fever. but one of the partners scheduled a mandatory meeting. at 4pm in the afternoon. i was not allowed to go home sick because the meeting was mandatory. 

so while i was there, i licked my hands and touched every door, copy machine button and any other common area i could. yeah especially the bosses' phones....

"i used to sneak free breakfasts at a luxury hotel. while i was in between jobs over a decade ago i lived next to a really nice luxury hotel with an omelette bar restaurant in the atrium. about four times / month i would put on a suit at 7:30 a.m., comb my hair, walk into the hotel past the front desk, and then discreetly head over to the elevator. 

i'd take the elevator up to say the 10th floor, jump off and find someone's usa today they hadn't yet grabbed from their doorstep. then i would head back down to the atrium - stepping off the elevator in full suit and tie, and casually read ""my"" usa today as i stood in the breakfast line. 

nobody ever questioned whether i was a guest - and i'd get these massive omelette breakfasts with parfaits on the side, toast, fresh juice, the whole 9-yards. sometimes i'd get seconds and sneak it out the door in my briefcase for lunch.

after a few months of this the cook caught on and started giving me looks, so i stopped.",11

"i pretended to be gay so i wouldnt get arrested. no regrets alright so my town has a super strict curfew. (i live in arizona which doesnt use daylight savings time which means the sun comes up earlier than in other places) and me and my homie were out one night from like 9pm to about 5am when the sun started to come up. we were at a park just chillin and a cop comes up. (we were 15 at the time) the cop walks up to us and starts to ask us what we were doing out so late. 

without another thought i make my voice go as high as possible and say.

"i just jacked off in front of a meth head.. i broke up with my fiancee about a week ago. since then i've been trying to hook up but tonight i went a bit far.

after i got some food i was walking home and that's when i saw ""felicia"".  she's not bad looking. she looks like she's done meth a bit though. she asked for food as i walked by so i said fuck it and shaded my food with her. i went and bought some beer and smokes and we sat by the river for a while. the whole time she never made sense. not at all. 
so we went and sat by the river for a while and drank some beer and i listened her ramble. 
eventually i asked if she needed money. i asked about five times and then i asked if i could see her tits and jack off in front of her. she said, ""well no ones stopping you."" she said she was kind of turned on and she showed me her tits and then let me grab her nipple. i jacked off while she watched and then i went home. my ex fiancee is sleeping in the room over and i can't stop wanting to go back to the river.

"for an entire year, i would jerk off and finish in my roommates shampoo bottle. nsfw. this was almost 10 years ago. i studied in a boarding school in europe and i had a private room with a shared bathroom. so anyways my roommate was such a bad person, he would take things that are not his, broke my macbook just because he thought it was funny, would use my stereo all the time until it was taken away because he would always have the volume on high, and various other things. as i said before, we had a shared bathroom, so whenever i would shower, i would jerk off and cum in his shampoo bottle, or at least try my best to get as much in as possible. i did this for a year without him noticing, and every day when he comes out of the shower i would feel proud of myself. i have no regrets and looking back at this situation actually makes me laugh. i promise you i'm not a bad person or even disgusting, but he deserved worse.

"i told my ex-boyfriend that i aborted our baby but i actually kept the baby and had her adopted.. i (21) was with my ex-boyfriend (28) for 3 and a half years, i broke up with him last may. 

he was very abusive during the whole of the relationship and i ended up in hospital a few times, once with a broken arm and a disclocated jawbone and another time after he had strangled me to the point he called an ambulance because he thought he had killed me. i decided not to press charges as he had warned me what his friends and family would do to me if he got put in prison. 

i found out i was pregnant in april last year and the abuse got worse when i told him, he threatened to kill me several times and beat me up three times because i refused to have a termination. i managed to leave him when he was at work one day with the help of two of my friends and my cousin, and moved in with one of my other cousins who lives a 3 hour drive away from him, i am still living there now. 

my ex-boyfriend contacted all my family members when he got home and realised that i had left and all my belongings were gone and made a new facebook account to message me after i blocked him on my actual account. i told him that i had booked myself in for an abortion the following monday and to please never message me again. i messaged him on the monday to let him know that i had gone through with the termination and blocked him off that account also. he hasn't contacted me since. 

i actually kept the baby and gave birth at the end of last year, i had her adopted to a childless couple as i had no home of my own, no savings and no job as i had moved across the country to get away from my ex boyfriend. i think about her every day and wish that i was in a position to have brought her up myself. 

i know this makes me a horrible person for not telling him but i'm glad i've finally got it off my chest. i hope he never finds out, my family and close friends know and i don't think they would ever say anything but i am worried about when my daughter is older and whether she will ever want to find me or her father and that it will all come out.",11

"called cps to investigate my brother and sister in law.. my brother in law, sister in law and 8 year old niece all live in a 2 bedroom house that i remember as once being an older, but nice home. over the last several years, i'm not sure exactly what happened but they just... stopped caring about it. 

i wouldn't worry so much if it was just messy. but the house is filthy to a point that it's got to be unsanitary. their 2 dogs use the bathroom in the house and it doesn't get cleaned up.  the pantry is full of rat feces and various chewed up packaging for different pantry foods. the smell is unbelievable. it's so bad that it's unbearable even from outside if the door is open. the air conditioning vents are packed with dog hair... the fur is everywhere really. 

the shower head in the master bathroom broke about 5 years ago. instead of just replacing it, they stopped using it. not the shower. the entire bathroom. now it's just full of dirty clothes, trash and dog waste. over time, the toilet and shower have gotten stained and filthy. they don't bother cleaning it because... well, why bother?  they don't use it. instead, they all use their daughter's bathroom (also absolutely filthy). 

the oven and stove broke a few years ago as well. they just stack their mail on top of it and cook with the microwave or toaster oven. most of the time they just eat out. 

3 years ago, a leak in the air condition caused a large part of the ceiling in my niece's playroom to cave in. a year later, the room and all her toys were still covered in mud, dirt and insulation. 

my husband and i have tried to help. we fixed the ceiling ourselves. we have them money to fix the oven but they never fixed it. i have gone over to their house several times and cleaned it as well as i could manage, but a week or two later it would always end up being disgusting again. 

they're not impoverished. they both work well paying jobs. they shop often and eat out at expensive restaurants. their daughter was in gymnastics and doing very well, but they pulled her out this year because they ""couldn't afford it.""

my niece stays with us every few months or so. we have kids her age and we love having her here. she's always sent with an inhaler and breathing treatments due to asthma, but i've never needed to use them. at her house, she constantly struggles to breathe. 

her parents both have issues with alcohol and prescription pills. 

the other day, a mutual friend called and said she went to visit the other day and had to walk right back outside to vomit. the smell is that bad. 

so i decided i was done. i've tried to help. i've talked to them a thousand times. but ultimately, i care more about my niece's health and safety than her parent's feelings. 

so i called cps and told them everything.

"my girlfriends dad made me cry.. light: casual confessions

my girlfriend and i have been together for 3 and a half years. when i started dating her i was 19 and she was 16. it doesn't sound great on paper, but i cared about her very much and i never had any nefarious intentions. when her father learned that i was 3 years older, he tried to break us up. he threatened me and i stood my ground and respectfully told him that i wasn't going anywhere. since the day we met, i have never been anything but kind and loving to her and respectful towards her family. her father and i have never been close at all, but over time the hostility lessened and it turns out that we are similar in a lot of ways. i knew that he never liked me, but a certain amount of mutual respect that grew between us.

last night my girlfriend broke up with me. i had no idea anything was wrong between us, so i was very shocked. as far as i knew we were getting ready to move in together. i had no idea what to say so i just let her leave. today i went to her house to talk to her. when i knocked, her father opened the door - she lives with her parents. i asked to see her and he told me that she wasn't there. there was this look on his face and i instantly knew that she was with someone else. i asked him and he didn't say anything. she's with someone else. great. i told him to have a good day and as i was leaving he called my name and told me that he ""misjudged me."" we nodded at one another and i left. i could see that he meant it.

while i was walking back to the train station i teared up a little. i have no idea what is going to happen with her, but for some reason it feels good to know that i earned her fathers respect.",11
"i got a handjob from a masseuse. i've got a fiance and if i tell her, i'm sure she would break up with me.. pretty much the title.  this happened 5 hours ago, i went for a massage at a (admittedly above-board) looking place.  the masseuse told me to get naked and she would be back in five minutes.  while she was massaging my upper thigh, i got a boner.  she noticed this, removed the towel and went to business like it was just part of the procedure.  i didn't stop her.

upon checking the massage parlors website when i got home, they clearly indicate that ""sensual massages"" are available upon request.  i guess seeing as i am a slightly overweight and balding 34 year old man, she assumed i was there for that.

my fiance gets home from work in a few hours.  i really need to tell her.  i wish i could go back 8 hours and not get into my car to drive to this place. so much fucking regret.

**update:**

i told her.

i feel like shit about it, and if it happened to her, i would want to know.  we are going to be spending the rest of our lives together and i don't want shit like this in my closet, and if this happens to her, i want her to be able to tell me.  anyways, the conversation was quite short and went something like this:

claire's first question was ""was she pretty?""  i answered truthfully, which she was an average middle-aged women who smelled like cigarettes and stale coffee.

the follow up was ""well then why didn't you stop her?""  because i honestly froze for a minute, and just went with it.

she didn't really like this answer.  she then asked ""are you not happy with me?""  i told her that she is absolutely perfect, but this had nothing to do with being happy in the relationship.  i was in a position where i had to do something and i didn't, which is my fuck up and failure as a partner.

she then said that she is not going to break up with me ""just yet"" but will sleep on it and see in the morning.  she seemed pretty hurt, she was fighting back tears.  i offered to sleep in the guest bedroom and she said that i didn't have to be that dramatic.  maybe a good sign?

a few people have bought up sexual assault.  i don't feel like a victim, i feel like a perpetrator.

(**probably) final update:**

i think we are good, all things considered.  i'm probably not going to update this post again unless something drastically changes.

we had a brief chat this morning before she went to work (i work from home) and she told me we need to talk tonight.

i said ""uh-oh, that doesn't sound great"" and she ""it's not like that, i just needs to understand why you didn't stop her"". i asked her what would happen if we reversed roles, and she said she would stop the dude. i said i would say the same thing, but in practice i just froze up and couldn't. she was surprisingly empathetic towards this.

she also said she doesn't feel like she can trust me right now (understandable), but she doesn't feel like i cheated on her per se, rather i just did something incredibly stupid.

she actually said she almost wishes that i didn't tell her, we agreed that our marriage needs to be a 100% open and honest relationship, we are a team and need to deal with shit together. we've both had relationships in the past where this was not the case, and landed up getting hurt as a result.

all that was about 6 hours ago, at about 9:00am this morning.

she texted me about an hour ago saying she still loves me, and the more she thinks about it the more she sees it as a mistake, not a character flaw, and that if i find myself in a position where this can happen again, i need to stop it.

i wrote an email (with an old anonymous email address i have) to the place describing what happened. i didn't mention the masseuse's name - but what happened and that the ladies there should be asking for consent. i got an almost immediate reply apologizing and assuring me that they are not a brothel etc. more like cya stuff than acknowledging the problem. but at least i did something.

\---

thanks everyone for taking the time to read my story and comment.  honestly, i got a lot more support and attention than i thought that i would, and it helped a lot.  even those calling me out for being a bitch, i probably needed to hear that as well.  a simple ""no"" would have turned this whole thing into a  mildly humorous anecdote.

my brother ended up asking if i'd seen it and i just lied and said i hadn't. i did feel guilty afterwards and i never did it again, but i also never told him what happened to the car. he just thought he'd lost it. we grew up and i'd forgotten about it for years up until now.

we live in the same neighbourhood so we occasionally see each other when we're out and about. the night before last we ran into each other at the post office. we talked while we waited in line and after that we had a coffee together. when he asked me if i wanted to go back to his place i agreed. i honestly don't even know why; i just wasn't thinking straight. we had a glass of wine and then we wound up having sex.

"i did things online at age 12 that i shouldn't have. i discovered omegle when i was around 11. my friends and i liked to go on video chat and talk to people. i don't know why it interested us so much.

anyone who's ever used omegle knows that there is an abundance of nudity on the site; its main use is essentially masturbation. this intrigued me, too, as i'd never been exposed to that before.

i started to visit the site without the company of my friends. i'd talk to people; i especially liked having conversations with older guys. having their attention made me feel important. by the time i was 12, these men started asking things of me. and i complied.

i started showing my breasts first. i didn't have much to show, but the guys still seemed to like them. i told them i was 18, and they somehow believed me, despite the fact that i hadn't even gotten my first period yet.

soon, my breasts weren't enough for people; they wanted to see more. i showed them, of course, because i didn't want to lose their interest. i started mutually masturbating with men, even though i didn't know how to do it properly so i wasn't really getting any pleasure out of it. i didn't even know what a clitoris was.

i feel incredibly guilty that i made these men unknowingly masturbate to someone who hadn't even gone through puberty. how were they supposed to know? i had started to develop breasts and hips by that point, so i probably just looked like a thin woman.

these men are obviously not at fault; they had no idea. but am i at fault? at the time, i was just a preteen who desperately craved attention and found a way to receive it. i didn't fully realize how awful the situation was until later in life.

as a side note, i know this post is kind of teetering on the edge of being against the rules, but i tried my best to describe this in the least graphic way. i just really needed to get this out. i'm not quite sure how to feel about the whole thing.

edit: thank you so much, everyone! i really appreciate the comments. i never knew how common this actually was for young girls; it's not something i ever talked to my friends about doing so i had no idea. i've always wondered whether those men knew i was lying about my age, but it seems most of you think they were aware. anyway, i didn't expect to get this much feedback, so i'm both overwhelmed and thankful.",11

"remorse i stopped caring for my parents when i saw their will. my parents are in their 80s and probably won't live for another year or so. i have really stepped in to take care of them by making sure they have groceries, their bills are paid, their doctors know what's going on, getting their meds, having their house taken care of, etc. this has been at a cost to my career and personal life. my other siblings won't lift a finger and say they don't have time because they have kids but it's because they know i am doing it.

i got a hold of my parent's will and was outraged. they are leaving 100% to my two siblings who don't do shit for them. their justification? my two siblings have kids and i don't. i am actually losing money by taking care of my parents and what they are leaving me behind will not make up for that. and i don't make a lot of money but my married siblings are both married to rich men. my sisters don't even have jobs.

"when i was 5, i accidentally gave a girl in my class permanent brain damage. it was many years ago. the girl in question was the daughter of the woman that babysat me. every morning their mother would rummage through my lunch box and give her kids all of my treats and other stuff my own parent had packed for me. despite the fact it wasn't the girl's fault, i hated her for it.

one day we were in class and were released for recess. our class was notorious for never getting the little red bikes that there were only a few of because our teacher never let us out in time to get them. it was a first come first serve situation, with the entire school rushing to get these little bikes. this particular day we had gotten out early enough, and i was running towards a bike when the daughter of my babysitter rushed up and grabbed it right in front of me. i was furious and sad at the same time. in a fit of jealousy, i pushed her off the bike, got on it, and rode off. all i remember after that is cycling around the yard and looking over at a gathering of adults. they'd formed a circle around the girl and rushed her away. i never saw her again.

fast forward a few years later, and i'm in my early teens. my parent introduces me to the family that used to babysit me. ""don't you remember so and so?"", and this is when i found out i had given this girl brain damage. it had stunted her growth and she developed a serious learning disability because of it. i felt petrified and extremely guilty, but i never said anything to anyone.

"shower poo. basically i used to date a guy that was also friends with my best friends boyfriend. so at one stage the four of us had been together for about four days, and i was still at that stage of pretending i don't poo.

we had been living of meegoreng, easy mac and maccas and went to block buster to get some dvds out. the whole time my stomach felt like it was about to explode! i kept sitting on the carpet pretending i was interested in the dvds on the bottom shelf but really i was  using the floor as some kind of barrier/plug to stop the dreaded mess from escaping out of me. 

finally we got back to the guys house all ready for a night of movies and.. more food. i could feel the beads of sweat dripping down my forehead and the more the boys asked me why i was being so quiet, the more i felt the poo would eventually have no choice but to come out my mouth. but i knew i had tried to keep it in too long so what would come out would be an absolute horror show. the toilet that was directly outside alexes room just wasn't an option. 

i decided to go for a shower to cool myself down and go over my options. as soon as i got in that water i felt my self automatically sit on the floor, and before i knew it was sitting on what looked like a pile of heavy green horse poo. 

as soon as it left my body i knew i fucked up. 

i had to act quickly so began mashing it down the drain with my knuckles, pushing it in the whole with my finger tips and trying to scrape the smears of poo from the cracks of the tiles.  i then grabbed what ever cleaning product i could find in the cupboard and began pouring it all over the shower and spraying perfume prefusely. i'm still dumbfounded they never smelt it as soon as i pood (unless they just didn't want to embarrass me) 

i remember laying in the bed after wards feeling so traumatised and paranoid the poo would emerge on the next person to have a shower. the only thing i can say i learnt from this is be a normal person and go to the toilet. ",11
"when i was college, i stole hundreds of dollars worth of food and snacks from one particular vending machine.. this happened many years ago. in the building that i typically went to studied in, there were 4 vending machines, 2 newish machines for drinks, one for snacks, and one very old machine for certain drinks and microwave meals. this old machine had 5 or 6 rows and each row rotated by the press of a button (with another 5 options too choose from when you rotated it). such items that this usually carried we're microwave mac n cheese, cup ramen, some pasta meals etc, for drinks it usually had yoohoo for some reason. prices for the meals were $3 and drinks were $1. anyways being a broke student and all, i usually studied for a long time in this area until i got really hungry. i would also look at these meals but end up going to another vending machine to buy 50 cent snacks. one day i got really hungry for some real food so i decided to get a mac n cheese. i put in 2 dollar bills, 2 quarters and 5 dimes to get to the $3.00. i got my food and i usually make a habit of checking the change area in the machine to see if anyone left money in it.  i reached in and took out exactly 5 dimes. this made me curious so i proceed to put another dime in the machine. the machine spits it out in the change area but it registered the money! at that moment , a light went off in my head as i realize what this means. anyways the very next time, i came back to the vending machine with about 20 dimes and proceeded to take about 7-10 items and stuffed it in to my bag. i did this for almost 3 months before maintenance came in and fixed the issue.  i proceeded to eat mac n cheese, ramen, and drank yoohoo through the rest of the semester and into summer.

"i think my daughter is gay update. light last night when we were alone i asked her if she was dating her roommate. she was quiet for a few moments before saying that she was indeed going out with the girl. she looked like she was about to break down so i hugged her and told her that it was okay and that i would love her and support her no matter what. she began crying and told me that she was so relieved i didn't hate her. i told her i'd never hate her ever and she cried some more. 

she also told me that she dated her best friend (a girl) for 3 years. that damn girl stayed over at my house a thousand times! they used to lock themselves in my daughter's room and play really fucking loud music all the time. i thought they just jumped around and danced and sang. i'm not so sure anymore. 

we decided not to tell my wife anything yet. she'll tell her a few days before we fly back home.

so yeah, my daughter is gay. and it's great because it means she's not gonna get pregnant.

"no regrets nsfw i told my gf that i really like futanari and hentai. my gf and i have lived together for almost a year now and she is amazing. we play video games together, watch anime and have very similar interests. it's almost like she is me but in girl form. one day we got on the topic of things we've never told anyone and i decided that if i was going to be with someone they should love me for everything i'm interested in... including futanari (hentai chicks with dicks) and just hentai in general. so, i told her that those things really turned me on. i wasn't worried about her reaction because for some reason i knew she was either going to think i was disgusting or be totally fine with it. it actually felt like a big weight off my shoulders.

so i tell her, she looks at me a with wide eyes at first then looks down and starts twiddling her thumbs. i immediately think ""well, looks like things will be awkward for a while."" when she mumbled something that i couldn't really hear. i asked her what she said and she replies
""i've actually always wanted to have a dick and i love hentai... i subscribe to ton of boards on reddit. i even really like traps...""

i was so stunned she said that. it hit me like a mack truck. so we got to talking about it more then ended up browsing reddit together all night and sharing our hentai collections. turns out we are more alike than i even thought. we'd each be scrolling through going ""ooo i love this one! i have it saved already."" then we ended up turning on hentai haven and watching our favorite hentai episodes together while having sex a few times. 

honestly, i don't care what this makes me. gay, bi, straight with weird fantasies. all i know is i was completely myself around her and received nothing but acceptance and now an even larger amount of understanding. we also already had sex a very healthy amount, but now it's even more so. it's really common place for us to be gaming on our pcs together while casually browsing reddit and sharing hentai. i honestly have the best gf in the world.",11
"i sexually harassed a girl when i was a 6th grader. we all learn about sex when we are in elementary school. for me, though, i learned about it much earlier. i was first introduced to porn when i was 7 years old.

i genuinely can't even remember where or how i came across it, but i did. i continued watching it for many many years. i still do, in fact.

but one thing porn doesn't really teach you is the law. aside from the occasional intro text saying ""all models are 18 and older"", i knew nothing else.

by 6th grade, i unfortunately knew the act of sex very well. years of watching that kind of stuff teaches you a bit. what i didn't know were the laws about sex.

i knew the basic stuff like rape being illegal and stuff like that, but i didn't know what sexual harassment/assault were or that they were illegal.

well there was a girl in 7th grade that i knew from the year before that walked the way i walked home from school.

the middle school bus (which came from a middle school many miles away) would drop the 7th and 8th graders off at the elementary school and have them walk home.

fair enough.

well i would harass this girl almost every day after school. i would say things like ""hey, sugartits!"" ""nice ass!"" and way worse things that i can't really remember.

i knew these things were not ok to say to her. i thought they were frowned upon, but i had no idea what i was doing was a literal crime. i don't know what the fuck was going through my head. i just felt a push or an urge to say them.

well she went and told the vice principal about it. the day i got called in, i played dumb. i said ""no. i don't know who you're talking about."" the school let me off with no repercussions. nothing on my record or anything.

i stopped talking to her because i didn't want to get in trouble, but i still waved at her sarcastically and i would wink at her.

if you look through the paperwork, the whole thing was forgotten about, but the paper isn't always right.

about 7 months ago, i woke up in the middle of the night after having a dream, more like a flashback, to the terrible things i said to this girl.

i had completely forgotten about it since it had happened so long ago (more than 10 years ago). 

since i remembered it, i can't unremember it. 

for the past 7 months, i have been searching on social media trying to find this girl and ask her for forgiveness, but i've had no luck so far.

i've since then developed insomnia and a deep hatred for myself. i am having such a hard time forgiving myself for the things i've done. 

i know that if i were to ever meet her again, i would burst into tears and beg for her to forgive me. i know for sure she hasn't forgotten it.

i'm sorry if this post goes all around the place, but my mind has been going in a million different directions this year.

to miranda, if you're reading this, i am so sorry. you have no idea how much i regret the things i did those many years ago. i hope that if this ever reaches you, you can find it in your heart to forgive me.",11

"i'm in a casual sex relationship with my ex's little sister.. my ex and i were together for five years. we broke up in late 2014. her little sister and i attend the same university (she's doing her degree and i'm doing my post-doc), so we occasionally see each other. we're not particularly close so most of the time we just smile and nod as we walk past each other and sometimes we exchange a few words. however 4 weeks ago we were both getting lunch in the food court and we struck up a conversation. we ate lunch together and we exchanged numbers because i agreed to give her some of my notes. 

later that night i sent her some of my notes. a few days after that she asked if i could help her understand some things. we talked over skype but we were having trouble communicating so i agreed to go to her apartment to help her the following morning. we wound up having sex that morning and then again a few days later. we both enjoyed our time together and we agreed to continue doing it on a regular basis. 

she is a little young but she is beautiful and i really like her. i'm a little confused because i'm not sure whether what i'm doing is wrong or not... i'm also not sure if my ex would be upset or whether she would just brush it aside. we're both in agreement that our relationship is casual and that we will keep it private but i am a little worried about her sister finding out. conflicted",11

"i've never hit my children, but today i slapped my daughter.. i'm a mom, i have a husband and 4 kids. i recently lost my mother. she was evening to me. she was the only parent i had and i lost her. it destroyed me inside thinking the only things left of her is my memories.

we were at the funeral today. one of my daughters (the eldest) didn't even seem to care or want to be there. i stood up on the stand talking about my mom and all i could see is my daughter's eyes pinned to her phone texting. it made me feel sick with rage, but still i carried on talking because that was the only thing i could do now for my mom. i didn't want to make a scene.

when i went back to sitting down i told her to put her phone away and she just replied ""whatever"". i couldn't believe any of this was happening at one of my own parents funeral. it made me feel sick and i didn't know how to respond.

we all followed the casket to the grave. it was the hardest thing i've ever done. burying my father was a lot easier because we weren't as close and i was a lot younger, but my mother was everything to me and stood by me through all my life. she was the only person who i felt i could go to for advice, when i'm upset and when i need a shoulder to cry on. i could remember being with her sitting in the garden when i was a kid. it felt like everything we had was gone and never coming back. when i was a child i thought my parents would live forever and now i was burying my mom. it was the most soul destroying thing i've ever done. it felt like after her death i was just delaying my mourning and it hit me completely at the funeral.

i was crying, but yet again noticed my daughter on her phone, this time taking a picture of herself for snapchat. i lost it there in front of everybody and grabbed her phone and stamped on it. she called me a bitch for stamping on her phone and i lost it and slapped her across the face as hard as i could.

everyone just looked at me like i was some kind of monster. my husband pulled my daughter away and i just stood there watching everyone judge me. like i was some kind of mad woman.

we get home and the car ride was quiet. nobody talked but my husband. all i could think is how i've raised a child who cares more about snapchat than her own dead grandmother. it makes me feel so sick i can't even put into words.

i made meals for everyone but her tonight. she can starve for all i care. i heard my husband talking to her and she said that i was out of order hitting her and she'll never forgive me. it's like she has no idea just how much she has hurt me. it's unforgivable.

i've never slapped my children before. i've showered them in love and attention up until this point. i feel so empty inside and bitter. i'm starting to really resent my daughter. i realize i shouldn't have slapped her, but how could she do this to my mother? her own grandmother? how could she do this to me? i raised her for 14 years and gave her everything she ever needed just for her to become what she has become.",11
"my new school did this ""send a rose to someone anonymously"" thing and i bought 7 for myself just to make the hoes jealous.. okay, so i moved to this new high school, and my class isn't really the best. the type of class with students that won't talk to you and force you to sit alone just for the sake of not having to worry about them being the ""class loser"" or something. they're just delusional assholes who want to see you fall.

i obvi switched class, and i just had 2 more days here before actually switching. i decided to throw in $20 to buy myself 7 roses.the girl who delivered them during the lesson had a handful of roses, and dumped them all down in my table. everyone did this 'oof' and 'uh em gee' sound effect. i stuffed them into my open bag with them blooming out as a way of saying ""haha bitches u thought so"" to my class. i have a lot of old friends in the school anyways, so i didn't mind. only one or two popular girls had like 5? and 50% else had 1. they were all like ""..."" and ""how?! but your new..."" some of them even tried to friend-zone me and suddenly started treating me nicely, like seriously?

"inspired by the coconut, shoebox, and couch fucker stories, i have now decided to share my own disgusting past story. please feel free to judge, i am very disgusted by my actions.. i suppose i could post this in tifu, but i never got caught for what i did, that i know of...

to begin, i guess i'll just start out by saying this started around age 12 and continued off and on throughout some of my highschool years. when i was 12, i began watching porn and became addicted to it and masturbation pretty quickly. i was pretty good at getting away with it (i assume) and never had any issues getting caught as i was super paranoid about making sure i covered my tracks.

over time, i realized that the same porn videos and masturbation methods that i was using were not getting me off the way that they used to. i began to search for alternative ways to get off, as i'm sure every male has at some point. i started to create my own sex contraptions (obviously when my parents weren't home)... the best one i made comprised of a latex glove in between a towel that i would roll with the glove inside. i would stretch the glove around the edges and hold it all together with a rubber band and i would use whatever lube i could get my hands on. i was so proud of myself for actually completing this ""project"", and it kept me satisfied for a while (i would change the glove out, i wasn't totally like the coconut dude at this point). after several uses, again i began to get tired of this, but it was all i had at the time.

one day, i was in my parents closet, and i found a box of ""the stash."" any of you out there who have been traumatized by finding your parents secret stash of sex toys will understand what i'm talking about. here's where my problem goes more south. as grossed out as i was by the box of sex toys used by my parents, i was fascinated. i waited for the next time my parents were gone and i explored the box (i'm disgusted writing this, please forgive me). the item that caught my attention most, was my dad's fleshlight.

for those of you who are still reading, you're brave. it only gets worse from here. from this point on in my life, if i ever had that ""urge"" to masturbate, i would wait until i had the house to myself and i would go to town on that fleshlight. i would even use small amounts of my parents lube that i had found, and man it was the best experience that a hormone-filled teenage boy could have asked for aside from actual sex. i would always clean it thoroughly after use, as i would have wanted to die if anyone ever found out what i was doing. one day, when i went to use it, i ""prepared"" myself and got everything ready, and when i ""entered"", i was struck by absolute terror...

it hadn't been cleaned from previous use (not by me!)

i immediately was sent into regret and did not want to continue... as the remnants of the most recent use still remained.. but the disgusting nature of my teen self prevailed, and i still continued and finished, not wanting to waste a rare occasion where i was alone in the house.

overall, at some point in high school, i guess it just kinda clicked how completely disgusting it was for me to continue doing it, so i stopped. i only wish i could delete the memories and guilt that still remains. as far as i'm concerned, nobody knows about this and the box is still there.

tl:dr- became addicted to porn and masturbation at an early age, found my parents sex toy stash, used my dad's fleshlight without him knowing for years. even once when he hadn't cleaned it after previous use.

edit: this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. even writing this out in words makes me feel so embarrassed and ashamed.

edit 2: further explanation and tldr

edit 3: i cleaned the fleshlight after the use even though it wasn't clean for me initially...

edit 4: at least i can say that i didn't have sex with my mother.",11
"my neighbor abused his dog, so i dognapped it and took it to a rescue farm to live on.. no regrets: if you don't feel bad.

the person who lives directly across the street from me is a disgusting old fuck who is the epitome of the awful neighbor. he's the type that will call the cops if he sees a car parked more than a foot from the curb or if someone's grass is half an inch too tall for his liking.

he had a german shepherd that he kept outside 24/7 and tied to a chain. the dog had maybe a circumference of about six feet in which to roam because the chain was so short, and it always spilled the small bucket of water. i probably filled that water bucket more than the dog's owner did.

one day, i saw him grab the dog by the head, pick him up off the ground, and throw him at the wall of the porch because the dog had pissed on the walkway and not in the grass. i marched over to his locked gate, and began screaming at him to knock it the fuck off, lest i call the police on him. he told me to mind my own business, and dragged the dog inside. i decided right then and there that by hook or by crook, i was getting that dog away from that asshole.

i got in contact with a friend of a friend who runs a private no-kill shelter on a huge farm. she said she'd be more than pleased to take the german shepherd and not question where it came from.

i waited about a week for the next time he left the dog outside while he was gone. i walked across the street, cut the padlock on the gate with bolt cutters, and freed the dog. he bounded into my car, and i began the 90 minute trek out into the country to take the dog to his new home. he fell in love with that farm from the moment he jumped out of my car when we arrived, and the lady who runs the shelter absolutely adores him. despite his previous lot in life, he's a very happy and playful dog, and shows almost no lingering effects from his mistreatment.

by the time i got back to my place, the neighbor was home. he saw me pull into my driveway, and asked if i'd seen his dog. i didn't even look at him, and said ""nope"" before going inside, and letting loose with a supervillain chuckle.

the dog is doing great at his new home, and is back to a healthy weight. the neighbor seemingly forgot about him after a few days, as i haven't heard of him ask anything further about the dog. another neighbor told me that the asshole assumes the dog ran away. you know, because dogs are capable of cutting a pad lock and opening a latched gate =p

if i see that bastard ever get another animal, i'm going to take it to the farm, too, only i won't wait so long this time.

"when i was 16 i prank called my dad over the course of 4 years.. i will save the details about what a unique and complicated human being he is, it would add to the story, but i am here for the confession.

when i was 16 i started hanging out this girl who just liked to smoke weed and chill in her room. one day, we accidentally called my dad and we heard him saying, ""hello, hello? heeeellloooo?"" it was so funny when we were high. this was early in the internet and cell phones so any trick was new and exciting. we started calling him periodically and saying nothing, it is still some of the hardest that i have ever laughed. we started recording his voice and playing it back to him weeks later. she would call while i was with him to avoid suspicion. 

 real innovation came when we figured out how to use three way calling to make his phone call other phones. he was one of the only black people  in our relatively small town so chinese restaurants and gun stores were always very fruitful . all of this peaked when we set up a call between us, him, and one of his band members that they kicked out for doing too much meth ( there was an acceptable amount of meth). by now, we basically had a sound board of him saying hello, asking questions, cursing and threatening. my dad had to simultaneously argue that it was his drummer who called him while explaining that it wasn't him who was cursing, even though it sounded just like him.

some other gems from our time:
- he said the fbi was looking for us
- he said he was running a trace on the line and we were making his day by not hanging up because he was going to be at our door step once the trace was successful.
- threatened us with his ""connections""
- more than once he had "" figured out exactly who it was""

"i laughed at my date yesterday (my bad).. i met a girl on tinder on sunday night. my general strategy is to essentially say hello and then go on a date as soon as possible. we went on a coffee date yesterday afternoon. she's in college so we talked about her major and stuff and then i asked her if she worked. she told me that she is a prostitute. i started laughing because i thought she was joking but it was clear that she didn't find it funny. i asked if she was on the job at that moment and she assured me that she wasn't but the whole situation was so odd and i was pissing myself laughing. she was visibly upset at the way i was acting but i couldn't help myself. i got really nervous and cracked a few jokes about it. but it was getting uncomfortable so i just sculled my coffee, wished her a good evening and then got out of there. i spent half of last night pissing myself laughing at the whole situation.

i know it was a little mean but fucking hell. just casually telling a guy you're a prostitute while you're on a date? like i'm going to date you while you're being paid to fuck other guys? i just found the whole thing so hilarious. my apologies to the girl, but i couldn't help myself.

"i have been having sex with my nephew nearly every day after hiring him at my restaurant.. just to be clear, he is adopted, so we aren't actually related by blood. he is 24 years old, i am 36. i never really knew him at all, he was adopted at 13 by my brother and then at 22 moved to brooklyn, where we are now. i only just met him when my brother called and asked if he could work at my restaurant. he grew up in kentucky, where my brother lives. again, i only met him once before this, when he first moved to brooklyn i met him briefly. 

&#x200b;

he did well at the restaurant for the first few weeks. there was only one thing, and it was a big thing, he was flirty. to the other employees, he was charming and flirty. he was fit, very muscular, and devilishly handsome. he had a kind of rugged masculine look to him, kind of like a more hairy/bearded marlon brando looking guy. i could tell he got a lot of ladies. but i had no interest in him like that, he was my nephew after all. 

&#x200b;

except... well, we ended up having sex. i knew him to be flirty with the other employees, but then one night it was just us and everyone else left (we would have little parties every thursday and saturday after closing) and he got flirty with me. i was drunk and we had sex in my office. unprotected unfortunately, but it was kind of a heat of the moment thing. 

&#x200b;

i suppose in the moment i just ignored that he was family. he looks literally nothing like us, his dad was from lebanon and his mom was spanish, he has thick dark curly hair and brown eyes, meanwhile our family is swedish and blonde with blue eyes with round faces. it wasn't hard for me to imagine in the moment that he wasn't family. the alcohol helped. 

&#x200b;

except since then, we have had sex 3 more times in the past 3 weeks. i cant even resist him. sometimes all that is needed to set me off is when his shirt is just slightly unbuttoned at the top and i can see his chest... ugh.

i feel like such an idiot. hes my god damn nephew, and everyone in our office knows it. we share a damn last name! its just too weird, but i also feel sometimes like there's no real point in me resisting it. i mean, sex is sex right? and we aren't really related, so what's the big deal? ",11

"i installed a porn blocker on my grandpa's computer as a joke, and now he just bought a brand new one because the old one was ""not working"".. i did it as a practical joke, because i saw his search history, and i thought it would be funny to see his reaction. i was going to uninstall it after a few days, just because, well, i'm not a monster. then three days later he goes out and spends $250 on a new pc, because the old one ""wasn't working"". it was refurbished, and non-refundable. i feel bad, because i was one day away from uninstalling the porn blocker, and telling him i did it as a joke. and now i can't, because he spent all this money on a new computer. it's still kind of a funny story, but i feel guilty about it. 



edit: i maybe should have mentioned it, but everybody in the family knows he watches porn. it's kind of accepted knowledge. nobody really cares, and we all kind of laugh it off, and try not to think about it too much. maybe installing a porn blocker, even temporarily was a little mean-spirited, but the old guy could afford to go a few days without it. comparing it to punching him in the face is not really fair. 



edit ii: holy shit, there are more deleted comments in this thread than, well, i can't even think of an analogy. my grandpa and i are buddies, he's more of a friend that just happens to also be related to me. i'm not ""trying to control his sexuality"" and it's certainly not a freakin' legal issue. i couldn't care less about the fact that he watches porn, in fact, i'd be surprised if he didn't. i thought it would be funny to see how he reacts. that's all. it's unfortunate that his reaction was one i didn't expect (buying a new computer), and i feel badly about it. hence, the confession. if commenters on this subreddit's main goal is to make the op feel like shit, then nobody would ever post anything good on here.

when there's nothing for me to do at work, to look busy i just open older projects and move things back and fourth on screen. if anyone comes by, i minimise the internet tabs and look like i'm deep into a project they all have no idea i'm working on. the funny thing is, if they looked into my computer history, i'm sure they'd find all my internet usage etc, but i know they won't. we're a tiny independent company with no it department. i'm the closest to an it guy the company has.

so, i spend my days on reddit. on facebook, or twitter. or tumblr, scrolling through porn blogs. it can get a bit boring, but i'm not really bothered. i get paid to be lazy. dreams come true, kids!

"attacked my wife while sleepwalking. to give some backround, i have ptsd, insomnia, and frequent night terrors.

one thing i have never done, however, is sleepwalk. this changed last night.

somehow, i lost a complete 24 hours and during that time i walked around naked, tried to drive, yelled/screamed at my wife, and even punched her.

she got all this on video - and she says i wasn't really attacking her. it was more like i was 'punching air'. i was glassy-eyed - and it was as if i didn't even see her or acknowledge her presence luckily, since i was sleeping my punches were very weak (so she says).

still, i am haunted by watching video of myself in a trance and haunted y losing 24 hours.

i feel terrible for punching and screaming at my wife.

she keeps trying to tell me it wasn't my fault, and she knows it wasn't me. that i was just sleepwalking.

i still feel terrible.

edit: i have checked myself into the hospital as of monday. thanks for your responses",11
i secretly replace name brand items with generic stuff. my bf hates generic products at the grocery store. he thinks name brand is better and worth the extra money. i completely disagree and am tired of this fight. so i've been refilling containers of name brand items with generic and disposing of the evidence. like i filled the windex container with generic glass cleaner and the fancy olive oil with kroger brand. he hasn't noticed a difference.,11

"i delete my daycare kids' search history to cover for them using the internet.. i work as a substitute for a daycare, and while their regular teachers are on vacation, i've been with the 7-10ish age group for two weeks now. early in the morning before a lot of kids have arrived and late in the afternoon when most have gone home, the kids are allowed to use the daycare's ipad to entertain themselves with youtube kids, but some of the older boys have discovered that regular youtube works if you get to it through safari. they always hurry to close it when i walk by — seriously, these kids have a lot to learn about subtlety — but i always check the history when they give it back and they pretty much exclusively watch minecraft videos and the occasional try not to laugh. so even though they technically should be getting in trouble for it, and my boss wouldn't be happy if she found out i let it happen, i don't agree with old administrators and their fear of the internet, so i turn a blind eye and clear out the history later. i figure the ones that have to sit around with me from 7am to 5pm deserve it anyway.

"(update #2) that dude who used to be locked in chastity. ~~so, this will be my final post before i get rid of this throwaway account forever.~~ i'll make this short and simple. i found out my wife was cheating - multiple text messages, voicemails, emails... and pictures from her cell phone all confirming this. 

got a lawyer, made backups of all evidence, told her nothing of what i know. she cried and asked why i asked for a divorce. my answer ""i don't trust you and i do not love you anymore. my lawyer will be in contact with you."" i moved out to an efficiency apartment and left the car that was in her name. i'm taking the bus to work now.

i'll rebuild my life. my lawyer guarantees this will be the easiest alimony case he'll ever have (after the overwhelming evidence) but possibly not custody of my children. i never mentioned the chastity to the lawyer... it's the ace up my sleeve, but i've got audio of her demanding i put it on.... at the very least i'll have full visitation rights. (and her making 5 times what i make, she can't squeeze child support out of me more than she will be paying me).

so, i'm sitting in my living room on a folding chair watching hulu on my laptop and eating pizza out of the cardboard box. i've got a case of beer and a space heater next to me and i'm fucking happy.... i just wanted to thank all of you for helping me overcome my issues.

this has been a worthwhile confession. signing off. goodnight and happy new year!!

"i went me my professor's office after class to get help and found out he was dying.. i was about to walk in and i heard him talking on the phone so i decided to wait and not interrupt his phone call. i overheard his asking the person on the other end if he could have some medical tests expedited because he only had months to live.

i was about to just leave  but he saw me standing there and waved me in and i hesitated because what do you say to that? and he just shrugged his shoulders  and awkwardly goes ""hospital bureaucrats"" and asked me what i needed help with. 

so i got help with an assignment and left. i regret not saying anything. he was one of the best teachers i've ever had and an amazing person and i just pretended like i hadn't just heard he was dying.

edit: i appreciate all the kind words. i mentioned in a comment but thought i should clarify that this was over a year ago. he died a few months after the semester ended. else i would still write him a letter letting him know how big an influence he had on my life. ",11

"confession: i had a sexual relationship with my stepsister, got her pregnant and paid for the abortion. nsfw. in high school my stepsister and i constantly found ourselves with a lot of idle time alone together.  we'd come home from school and it would just be us for a few hours.  both of our parents (her dad, my mom) traveled a lot, so we often had the house to ourselves on the weekends. we'd throw parties, have friends over.  for the most part we got along.  
  
late one night following al party, she came into my room just as i was getting into bed and asked if she could sleep on the floor.  a friend of hers had gotten wicked drunk, puked, and passed out in her bed.  there were people sleeping on the couches and in the guest room.  she had no place else to sleep.  i offered to give her my bed and sleep on the floor.  she told me to move over and crawled into bed with me.
  
we talked for a little while, laughing about the events of the evening, and smoked a bowl.  both of us had struck out with our respective crushes; they actually ended up hooking up and leaving together.   i was making fun of her crush, because he was a fucking tool, and she made fun of mine for being a ""superficial cunt.""  
  
at one point she dropped the pipe as i was passing it back to her, ashes spilled all over the sheets.  she got up and wiped them off while i teased her for being clumsy.  she was wearing a t-shirt and these hot little pajama pants that made her apple ass look great.  she got back in bed, i packed another bowl.  she was moving around, trying to get comfortable, when she slapped the sheets back.  i had a raging hardon tenting in my boxers.  
  
she giggled and laughed at first, then she made a comment about my size.  she flicked it, playfully.  it responded.  
  
""it's not you,"" i said.  
  
""i know.""  
  
(it was.)  
  

she turned away from me, curled up a little.  her ass was hanging out of her pajama pants and pointing at me.  every time one of us shifted, we slowly moved closer to each other.  
  
after a minute or so of silence she said, ""we could do stuff.""  
  
""we could,"" i said.  ""but we shouldn't.""  
  
""should we?""  
  
""probably not.""  

  
by this point i was almost touching her butt.  she moved and felt me.  ""we're not blood,"" she said.  
  
we talked about it a bit, about how we *could* do stuff, some stuff, and how we shouldn't do some other stuff.  
  
""no sex,"" she said.  ""just fun stuff.""  
  
""and no kissing,"" i said.  ""that would be too weird.  
  
we had established the rules.  she was practically grinding her butt against me.  
  
she turned and grabbed me, pulled me out of my boxers, and started playing with me.  she was a little rough (we were both pretty inexperienced) and was doing it all wrong.  i tried to correct her and that's when she said she wanted to watch me.  i said i wanted to watch her.  so we watched each other.  
  
we didn't cuddle or anything after and she was gone by the time i woke up the next morning.  i didn't see her all day.  
  
that night, after all of our friends had gone, she came home and found me swimming me in the pool.  we talked for a few minutes, but not about the night before.  she went inside, said she'd be up in her room doing stuff.  there was a look she gave that i would come to know.  
  
that night we went down on each other and 69'd, and that was what we mostly did every now and then.  at first only when our parents were gone, but then it became more frequent, eventually it was almost every day after school.  
  
the first time we had sex was an accident.  she was giving me a massage on my bed and when i flipped so she could work my front, i was tenting like mad.  she teased me with her butt at first, and kept sliding back and forth across my body.  i was poking out of my boxers and just kinda slipped in.  
  
she asked if she should stop.  

i said she should.  
  
she asked if i wanted her to stop.  
  
i said no.  
  

  
from there sex became as regular as oral.  there was a period of about two weeks where we fucked every day.  that was when we started kissing and sleeping in the same bed.  
  
that was when she got pregnant.  
  
she didn't tell me at first.  i noticed something was different about her.  she was getting fucked up almost every day.  she denied it, but i think she was trying to miscarry.  
  
once she told me i offered to do whatever she wanted.  she asked for the money, which i gave without hesitation.  her friend took her to the clinic (she told her it was some random guy she had hooked up with).  
  
we stopped fooling around after that.  things were only awkward for like a week or so before we got back to our original stepbrother/stepsister relationship.  i started dating a girl she didn't like.  so she dated a guy i didn't like.  we were passive aggressively trying to make each other jealous.  
  
we're both dating someone the other doesn't like now.  we only see each other a few times a year, but when we do we're careful, take precautions.  she's on the pill, i usually pull out.  unless she doesn't want me to.

"today i accidentally hit a cat and just kept on driving. i was grabbing some takeout earlier today and it just ran out in front of me. i felt my car hit it and looked back and saw it sort of... run/spaz/fling itself out of the street. i panicked and kept driving but eventually i felt so awful about it that i turned around. it's the first time i've ever hit anything other than a bug or a bird so i figured i'd go back there and if it was still there, i'd help it but if not, i'd just move on. i didn't know what else to do.

well, i got down there and at first, i didn't see anything. i was relieved and turned around, getting a look at the opposite side of the road.

a small crowd of what looked like two families was sort of gathered around a little bundle in the grass. there was even a kid there. when i turned into the road, i saw the bundle was the cat with a little towel tucked around it. there was a lady on the phone and a guy sitting next to the cat.

i kept driving.

i didn't know what to do. i didn't know if it was their cat or they were just better people than me who actually stopped to help the cat. they didn't see me or try to wave me down. it's not like i don't care. i have two cats and i know what i'd want someone to do if they hit either of them. but i panicked and chickened out and now i'm home, eating my takeout and snuggling my cat and crying and feeling awful.

i didn't want to tell my family, but i had to say something to someone.

if the person whose cat it was is reading this, i'm really sorry. i didn't mean to hurt them, and i hope they're okay.

edit: so i realized that i made the timespan of this sort of ambiguous and made it seem... not worse than it was, obviously, because it's awful, but more hopeless than it is for the kitty. 

i turned around to check on it pretty quickly. i didn't stop immediately but i turned around within a few blocks. less than a minute. and when i got back to where it happened, someone had already gotten the cat out of the road and was helping it. while i dropped the ball in terms of helping the kitty promptly, others didnt and it was helped very promptly.",11
"someone just committed suicide at the hotel i manage. after the security team went in and saw that the guest shot himself in the head, they ran out of the room and called me, since i'm a combat veteran (now a hotel manager), to go in and check to see if the guy was alive.  i went in, and he was lying on his balcony with blood and brains running out of his head.  i did what i had to do to confirm he was dead, and walked out to notify the pd.

they all think i'm a badass, when in reality, all it did was bring back flashbacks and now i'm in my office having strong anxiety and a roller coaster of emotions.

i set the microwave on 2 minutes and went back to the couch to watch cartoons.

came back with 10 seconds left and noticed smoke pouring out of the microwave. pulled open the door and saw the noodles completely destroyed, i took the glass of water out, threw the noodles outside and then my mom came rushing in and asked what happened. told her ""i was just making noodles"".

burnt some paint around the microwave cabinet and the house smelled like smoke for two weeks.

"my brother once raped me and i'm still in love with him.. i was 14 and my brother was 16 when our mom left. we didn't have anyone else so he basically took care of us. he left school to work full time so that he could afford to pay for rent and food. at the time i was really ungrateful because we didn't have much food and couldn't afford anything that my friends had but looking back i'm really grateful that he took care of me.

anyway, when i was 15 i started dating my first boyfriend. he was much older (i think he was 21) and he was just an all round bad guy but at the time i thought that we had something special. one night i had stayed at his house really late. we were sitting with some of his friends drinking beer when my brother came over. my brother came inside to get me. he grabbed me by the arm and walked me outside. i was telling him that i wanted to stay and my boyfriend and his friends pulled me away from him and beat him up. i was crying and telling them to stop, which they eventually did, and then we got in the car and left.

when we got home i was still angry at him and i stormed straight to our room and got into bed. i could obviously see that he was bleeding but i didn't realize until later but he was actually pretty badly beaten; he had a black eye, a big gash on his lip and he also had massive black bruises all over his ribs. he spent about half an hour in the bathroom cleaning up before he came in at which point i started complaining about how he wasn't my mother and he didn't get to say who i could spend time with. he didn't say anything but he was visibly angry with me and he came over, pushed me on to the bed and then held me down and raped me. i was crying the whole time but he didn't stop. after it was over, he rolled over and went to sleep and i spend the whole night crying. from the next day onwards he slept on a mattress on the floor (which he did until i left for college) and apologized every day for about three weeks and then we never talked about it again.

i know that it's horrible but ever since that night i've felt like i am in love with him. i thought that it would go away but it still hasn't. i've never told him about it and i never will but i feel incredibly guilty about how i feel. i have dated two guys but i ended it once it got close to sex. i do want to get married and have children one day but i just feel like i'm broken or something.",11
"i sold the only thing my dead mother left for me on her will and i don't regret it. my mother died 6 months ago. her will was short and she left us less money than i had expected. however, like most wills, she left us (the children) her belongings. she gave me, her son, the paintings that sat in our childhood home. she gave my sister most of the feminine things, perfume, jewelry, clothing etc.

when i first got the paintings in my possession, i didn't know what to do with them. i couldn't possibly hang them up in my modern home. they simply didn't match. and i'm not a man with much space for storage. if i haven't used something in 3 months, it's trash to me or it can be donated/sold. 
simply saying, these paintings were useless to me. i knew if i gave them to my sister, she would be ecstatic and put them all over her house. but i didn't want to give my sister everything. so, after four months of lugging around paintings, i came to the conclusion that it was time to let go.

i'll admit i loved my mother. but i didn't love her because she was a great mother, or a wonderful person. i didn't love her because she was always there for me. instead, i loved her for the simple reason that she was my mother. and that's just what children do, they love their parents. she was a narcissist and a damn good manipulator. she was a terrible woman. but even with this in mind, the sentiment of those paintings mattered to me for some strange reason. i felt as though i owed it to her to keep them. but i didn't.

i sold the paintings. i was given 10 and i sold all of them. the profit, i'll admit was hefty. and i am very appreciative for this reason. i doubt my mother would be happy with me. i know she isn't happy with me. but i don't give more than two fucks. i made $63,240 off of those paintings and i'm going to spend it well.

all i can say is thanks, mom. thanks for the paintings, but most importantly, thanks for the money.",11
"today, i made the conscious decision to crap my pants.. light

two weeks ago i gave birth to a beautiful, premature baby girl. she spent some time in the nicu but is since home and doing very well. i however, suffered a pulmonary embolism and severe preeclampsia after her birth, not to mention that while i was heavily pregnant i was admitted to the hospital for a few weeks to be completely tube fed due to malnutrition from my hyperemesis. so, it's safe to say that now that i'm back to eating again, my guts don't really know what to do with themselves. 

two days after bringing the baby home, i was sitting in the rocker and trying desperately to get her to nurse while i was home alone with her for the first time. after so much frustration and many tears from both of us she finally latched and was going strong. after only a minute or two i felt that very telltale rumble in my guts. i knew shit was about to go down(so to speak) and that i only had moments to make it to the bathroom. i looked down at my sweet baby girl, who needed to put on weight to stay healthy and who had so much trouble in the beginning and thought to myself ""she'll never latch back on if i take it from her now and upset her""

and thus, i made the conscious decision to shit my pants. it simply had to be done. i sat there and fed my baby while i soiled myself. i'm so glad i was home alone. i sat there in my messed pants for half an hour while i finished feeding the baby. i then put her down for a nap and cleaned myself up. i will never tell a soul that i know irl this story, but i knew it was too funny to never see the light of day at all. so here we are.

but in november of last year i met a wonderful woman. she's looking to settle down; she's childless but she wants to have kids; she has no problem with my kids; she's a teacher; she's very intelligent; all in all, she is really great and we get along very well. we have been taking it kind of slow. we have lunch together most days and she's met my kids a couple of times but she has been pushing for more. i stayed over at her apartment last week had sex for the first time. she has a beautiful body and everything went well but the whole thing was quite difficult for me. i lost my virginity to my wife and this was the first person that i'd had sex with since she died so after it happened i was racked with feelings of guilt. i spent the whole next day drinking, trying to avoid having to think about it. then later that night i went and got a tattoo of my wife on my chest. i was very drunk and i barely even remember doing it.

it looks really terrible and you can barely recognize her face unless you've seen the exact picture that the guy used to do it. i'm a 43 year old father and lawyer, not some wannabe rapper. i've got an appointment with a tattoo removal clinic on friday and i'm hoping that they'll tell me what i need to do to have it removed. i haven't told anyone about it because i'm embarrassed.

"i sent an anonymous spring loaded glitter bomb to my ex colleague who made me leave my dream job and made my life a living hell. 
i cannot admit this to anyone i know in person. last year i left my job as a paralegal at a law firm which i absolutely loved so much. the executives, the lawyers, and the admins, i was their favourite. one time the executive even said to me ""your presence brings so much joy into the office"". well all of that changed when the executive's pa was hired. she was a 30+ year old single, rude and desperate woman who treated me like a pet. after she passed her probation her attitude changed. she would yell at me, glare at me, talk to me with her back facing me and dump her work on me and make me work overtime without getting paid. the last straw was during christmas season when she made me carry a suitcase filled with 18 wine bottles to deliver to clients. i walked around the city for 1.5 hours in pain. despite all of this, i was always calm and friendly and i never gave attitude. 

i left for a better opportunity 8 months ago. still on very good terms with everybody, i even sent them chocolates and flowers during christmas. last month i decided to order a spring loaded glitter bomb to be sent anonymously to the pa. the most beautiful part is that the office doesn't have a reception. so she would've received it directly and opened it at her desk. 

despite this being immature and petty, i don't care. i'm satisfied. 

dear pa, i remember how much you hated a messy desk. well i hope you still find glitter in your keyboard and desk till this day and perhaps next time, fix your rude attitude. 

edit: for those who are wondering why i let this pa boss me around - i was 19 years old at the time, i was innocent, and it was my first job. i always believed that i should behave and do everything she said because it was my job. i'm not that person anymore and i've learned from my experience.

"no regrets i have secretly been giving belly rubs and playing fetch to my neighbor's dog without my neighbour's approval.. there is a black pug named africa who belongs to my neighbor, africa usually stays outside in front of the house inside of the fence.


at first i would just walk by and give the pug a small pat on the head but one day i felt really depressed and kinda suicidal and i had to go to school that day so i was walking and i was going to ignore the pug but the dog barked at me and i went there to pat her head but for some reason she did not want me to go, maybe she somehow knew i was depressed or maybe i really missed her but she ended up licking my fingers and laying on her back so i can give her a belly rub.


later when i came back she had a toy and i took it and threw it and she went running like hell, i think that day i stayed there for 2 hours just playing with this dog behind the fence and everyday since then i always meet her and play with her.


i really would like it if the neighbor would let me take it for a walk or something but the neighbor is really uptight when it comes to people touching his stuff, a friend of my once accidentally fell and he used his mail box to catch himself, the neighbor yelled at us if he catches us touching his things ever again.

but no matter what he does, i will see the pug, i wish i can keep her.

"i chucked poo at a jerky dog owners car after he wouldn't pick up after his dog. my apartment is located in a brand new, clean and nicely maintained building close the the city centre,

for the most part, my existence goes mostly unnoticed. the elevators are quiet and i rarely bump into anyone except the odd dog owner out for a late afternoon walk with their puppy. im a great tenant, and i also really hate confrontation or getting into any kind of dispute with neighbours so i try to keep to myself and not irritate those around me. 

i first met the asshole with the white dog on my way up to my floor during a weekend. he was one of those really beefy dudes with who's seen too much sun. his hair looked like it had been dipped in bacon grease and his cologne, i dunno, it smelled ""spicy""... my nose was burning by the time he got off the floor, it was like standing next to a real life ronnie from jersey shore except his skin was really bad and he was probably at least 40. my first interaction with this dude was nothing major, however, the next time i saw him in the elevator was last month and he had the little white dog with him. the doors opened and him and some other tenant were in a heated confrontation about not picking up his dogs crap from outside the front doors. he was being super belligerent to her, spat on the floor close to her feet and called her a c\*\*\*. i was horrified. the woman was shaking angry and almost in tears after he got off on his floor. she awkwardly turned to me during the ride up and apologized, saying that the guy always takes his dog out for walks but just lets it shit anywhere and it got smeared all over the floor when a delivery guy came in with a dolly. i told her it was brave of her to approach him about it as i frankly would never bother with such an aggressive personality. 

slowly as the week went on, i came to find out that other tenants had issues with this guy. namely one guy who ended up getting into a physical altercation with him over parking. too add to his general jerkiness, he always parked in the private visitor parking on the side of our building (which is off limits for tenants) because he was too cheap to pay for underground. 

2 weeks ago i ended up in the elevator with him, it was rainy outside so i had the hood up on my yellow jacket and the drawstrings were pulled nice and tight for my afternoon run. he had his dog on a leash, clearly about to take her out for a walk and his music was going tsktsktsk. as we got off on the main floor, he continued to pay me pretty much zero notice.  

i paused in the lobby to tuck my running tights over my socks... and proceeded to witness as his dog popped a squat, and left a long warm poo in the centre of the lobby floor. i looked up at the guy as if to say ""wtf!?"" but he just scrolled through his phone, glanced over at his dog, and mindlessly and tugged on the leash. i stood there in a moment of shock, thinking to myself 

""wow... this dude really does have no sense of decency"".

i really didn't want anyone to step in it, but i didn't want to pick it up either. i stood there for a moment debating what to do. i could see him out the window, walking up the street and pulling his hood up... and then the water cooler caught my eye. i grabbed a cup and scooped as much of the poo up that i could... gagging a bit because, who the f\*\*\* wants to pick up shit in a styrofoam cup. without thinking i went outside and whipped it out of the cup and onto his windsheild. it landed, unsuccessfully, in the corner dip of his windshield close to the wing mirror. i stood there mildly disappointed with my vengeful act, but at least it wasn't on the floor anymore.

 i tossed the cup in the bin and continue on with my run as per usual.

it continued to rain most of the evening and at around 7pm i decided to pop down to the convenience store across the street and get some chips. as i was walking back, the asshole was coming out of the apartment doors, running towards his car with his gym bag in hand.

suddenly my heart raced.

i couldn't just stop where i was, paranoid he'd notice my weird behaviour... so i kept walking towards the building. he started his car and immediately the auto windshield wipers went on, and i had a front row seat to witness a massive long, wet, smear of dog shit just spread evenly across the glass. at that point i panicked and headed towards the back doors to get in the building, my heart thumping hard in my chest. but i heard him scream 

""what the actual fuck"" 

after i got in my apartment i suddenly realized he was probably going to go to management and ask them to check security tapes. i spent 3 days worrying and dodging the elevators in my place like a terrified idiot. every time someone walked past my door i thought ""oh god, its him, he found out it was me"". 

finally, last monday, a notice went up with my picture, all 5'3 of me, hood up, chucking a piece of poo onto this guys truck with the caption ""do you know who this is? - management""

oh god.

what have i done.

i knew the end was near, and for 3 more days i waited for my inevitable demise once he found out who i was. 

i never heard a peep from anyone, nothing from management. i was completely convinced i'd be found out because my building has cameras everywhere. now the notices are gone, and i was in the elevator with the guy, and he's never given me so much as a nod.

but i can never wear that yellow rain jacket, ever again.",11
"when i was 6, i killed my baby brother. when i was 6, he was on the kitchen counter and my mom went to the other room and i pushed him down. i didn't hate him, i didn't dislike him, i just remember doing it. he hit his head and ended up dying. everyone thought that he fell. my mom became a different person, she blamed herself, dad blamed her. lots of screaming and fighting until divorce. because of my actions i grew up without a father, a brother, and a mom who spiralled out of control with depression. the worst part is i never got to have a brother. i grew up alone without many friends and i always kept it inside me. even now, as an adult, every day i feel a purposeless loneliness. now that the holidays are coming up, it's the time of year i always think what life would have been like and it is a whole alternate universe. i hope that my brother would forgive me for robbing him of a life and if my parents would know they would forgive me for ruining their lives, but i'll never know.

"i took a vacation day, lied to my wife, and am currently in a hotel room for the day.. lighti live in a small, two bedroom townhouse with my wife and my two daughters both under the age of 3. there is no quiet, there is no alone time. the girls sleep in their bedroom but wake us up all night. my boss is always riding me, my mother just came out of rehab pills! fuck doctors who overprescribe opiates, my father is leaning too heavily on me, and we just passed the anniversary of my mother-in-law's death -- a time that understandbly makes my wife very very emotional.

using a website that books hotels during the daytime eg 8a - 6pm, i reserved a room at a hotel that's about halfway between where i work and home. this morning, i left the house as usual, went out for a nice breakfast, then checked into the hotel.

i have spent the day alternately sleeping and whacking off in peace and quiet. the blinds are all drawn, and this bed is so goddamn comfortable. i'll check out in a couple of hours, then drive home.

my wife will never know that i spent the day pampering myself.

//edit: yes, of course my wife needs days off as well. and i give them to her, often. in fact, this coming saturday is her day out of the house by herself. 

//further edit:  i paid for this on my personal credit card -- wife and i each have personal checking accounts and credit cards in addition to our joint accounts. we set this up for ourselves when we got married, because we recognized the need for a private life in addition to our life together.

//furthest edit: re-edited this to take away the website i used.

//even further edit: holy shit, this has generated a lot of response. let's talk, everybody:  

(1) literally have never watched shark tank, don't have cable, don't even have a tv set up regularly in the house we didn't like how attached our daughter was to it, so we unplugged. so... no. not working for corporate america. look at my post history too... it's mostly about finances, rental cars, and general life things.  sunday night i was thinking about how nice it would be to have this kind of service, then found out that it's fairly common in europe, then was glad to find that one hotel in my city offered it.

(2) did end up telling my wife about this last night. she laughed, and said something along the lines of ""why did you tell me? sounds like it would be more fun to keep it a secret!""  my marriage is cool.  we give each other space to do our own things because we trust that we're not cheating or setting our family on fire or anything. all in all, this whole excursion ran me about $100, between the hotel and the food. $100 is not something that we freak out over in our house.

"update: i married my wife because i owe her family around $10,000. yesterday night, i posted a thread:
http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2cy4fg/i_married_my_wife_because_i_owe_her_family_around/

today, i took my wife out to lunch for our anniversary. when i saw her cute face, i immediately felt different. this was due to the fact that my thread blew up with lots of advise yesterday night. 

i want to thank you guys and girls. you know who you are. you made me think of my wife differently today. it was the first time that i actually told her i loved her without forcing myself to say it. at first, i muttered it under my breath and my wife asked what i said. i tried a second time and again, i couldn't speak up. then i said it loud for the third time. my wife smiled and her face turned all pink. 

we remained quiet for a little while until she began to ask me about my day. we talked for a little while before we visit her parents. i told her parents that i would start paying them back for the car they had bought me when i was in my teens. they told me not to worry about it; that they were happy that i remember and visit them even though it wasn't their anniversary. we talked for a couple of hours.

my wife and i returned home. it was then that i opened internet explorer and asked my wife to look at my thread. we sat down together and she read it. she began to cry while reading it and hugged me so tight. the last time i saw her cry was on our wedding night and it was ""tears of joy"" according to her. 

i told her that i realized that i was treating her unfairly. i told her i wanted to be more loving towards her. i told her i loved her and she was my life. she told me that i was her life, that i saved her from killing herself, and that without me she wouldn't be happy. at this point, i was crying.

my wife is currently sleeping. 

to conclude, i want to thank you all again for the advise. for the people that told me to pay back my debts and leave her, i have realized that i will stick by my wife till death do us part like i had promised her 10 years ago. she is my life right now and i don't want to have anyone by my side than her.

good-night all.

"my best friend died. what the hell?. i don't know where to post this, so whatever.
my best friend passed away yesterday. he was 47. he had been in poor health with diabetes, infections and a bad heart. it was a combination of the infection and heart that took him from the world.
he wasn't famous or rich, he didn't save lives with his job or was in the military. he never did anything noteworthy or exceptional. 
but, damn it, he was my fucking best friend.
he was a shining example of nice guys finish last. he was always getting the short end of the stick, and never bitched about it.
he was dependable, honest, true to himself and his friends, always had a good thing to say, and would always try to cheer you up if you where down.
a lot of people knew him. a lot of people were his friend, but he was my brother from another mother. 
and he is gone.
we had a lot in common, a love of star wars, books, music, comics, fart jokes, trivia, beer, and having a good time. i will still enjoy those things and all the things we would do together, but it will all be tinged with a little bit of sadness from now on. 
we were very different.  people that knew us independently would never imagine that we were as close as we were. he liked guinness,  i like pbr. he was yoda all the way, i am vader. 
but none of our differences mattered when we were together, because he was my best fucking friend that i will ever have, and i would give anything to be able to call him up and when he answered shout homosexual and hear him laugh every time and he answer brother. 
fun won't be quite as much fun, beer won't taste quite as good, metal music won't be as loud, and yoda will shrink a little without him, and i will carry this until i die.
i don't have a confession,  no dark secrets that some of you were hoping for. just some advice, take care of yourselves. listen to your bodies and what they tell you. 
and tell your friends, your real, hide a body friends, what they are to you and how much they mean to you.
now, my old, worn out, fat ass is going to cry alone again because the shoulder that i used to cry on is gone, and i fucking hate it.
good luck to you all and watch our for yourselves and each other.",11
"i have a micropenis. i'm 26 and i've never told anyone. my mom is the only person who knows. i hate it so much. i've completely avoided dating women because i'm terrified of anyone finding out. just the thought of a woman that i care about discovering my secret and then laughing at me makes me want to kill myself. i've heard women talk about how they love the feeling of being filled up and it's hurtful to know that i'll never be able to give that to a woman - yes, i know that sex toys exist but it's obviously not the same as face to face, emotionally intimate sex. i'm a little over 2"" so it's not possible for me to have sex in any sense. not to mention the fact that any woman who found out would inevitably see me as less of a man. i'm really lonely and i want to find someone who loves me but i have no idea how to do that. 

sometimes i forget about it but then i'll hear a female friend make a joke about how well hung the guy she's dating is or see a joke about it on tv and reality comes crashing back. women say they don't care and maybe it's true when talking about 5"" vs 6"", but it's certainly not true when talking about someone with a penis my size. they love being able to brag about how how well hung their boyfriend is or how good he is in bed or how tall he is or how successful he is. of course they're entitled to their standards, but it just breaks my heart because i know that i'll never be good enough.

"updatemy teeth hurt so bad that i feel like death is the only way i will get relief.. remorse: original can be found here. http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2qvy9a/my_teeth_hurt_so_bad_that_i_feel_like_death_is/

hello everyone, i know a lot of people requested pics of once i got my teeth done and i have photos here(http://i.imgur.com/ndjvmkt.jpg) and here(http://i.imgur.com/bfkncbw.jpg).

so before the turn of the year i made a confession about my oral pain caused by my teeth. i didn't think i would receive much attention if any at all. well, i was surprised after so many people shared their stories and offered to help. i got a lot in donations and had a couple of offers to do the procedure for free. the story blew up after the offers (most notably /u/sushiandwow and /u/danhook) and picked up by many websites. i am nothing but grateful to each and every person that made this all possible.

after checking to make sure /u/danhook is who he said he was i took him up on his offer to go see him and let him help me. on feb 1st (super bowl sunday) i went down to florida to get a hotel room before i met him on monday. he is cool as sh*+. totally chill guy that knows what he's talking about and very professional. anyways, we discussed about what he was going to do and about the timeline for everything since i was only down there until friday.
wednesday he took out all my top teeth and i got a denture for it. he told me that he wants to save the bottom teeth and after discussing it with another doctor there they decided it was best. which i am excited about because a bottom denture would suck.

so as of right now i have a denture on top and nothing was done on my bottom. sometime in mid-may to early june i will be going back down to get my permanent top denture, maybe some implants, and get all my bottom teeth fixed. i learned a lot while down there about how to take care and restore my gums and what i need to do so all of this isn't for nothing.

i had an amazing time from the time i left until the time i was home. i did so many new things and it was all thanks to the reddit community. without you guys, gals and others i would still be in pain.

if anyone has any questions i will try to answer them and i'm sure the dentist /u/danhook will chime in a time or two.

edit 2/22/2015: got my kids for the first time since the operation and they love the new teeth. everybody at work seems to like them as well. i still get people that are jealous, but that's natural. i've been preaching to my kids about the importance of oral care and to not end up like me. their mom and i don't have good genes when it comes to teeth, so they need to brush, floss and use mouthwash when after breakfast and before going to sleep.

"this is not r/ididntdosomethingishouldhavedone. hey r/confession,

recently there have been an exorbitant amount of posts where op tells us they've been wronged in some way (raped, molested as a child, robbed, etc.) but they also tie a small 'confession' to it to make it fit in our sub.  really, though, the post isn't about their confession, rather what someone else did to them. up to now it has been at the discretion of the mod team to keep the post live or not causing these posts to be in a gray area for us. these posts take away from the purpose of this sub, and as such will start getting removed moving forward.  

rule 1 states:

 > 1. all submissions must be a confession.

> **a confession is a statement acknowledging an act of wrongdoing you would ostensibly prefer to keep hidden.** the term presumes that you are providing information that you believe other people in your life are not aware of, and for this sub, associated with an admission of a moral or legal wrong.

> * **your confession must be an act you committed** 

> * a personal preference, opinion, bad or unpopular behavior are not confessions 

> * your sexual exploration is not a confession; it's a part of finding out who you are. /r/confession is not a place for submissions that read like pornography.

the first bullet is key for this reminder.  

also regarding rule number 5... if you missed reddit's formal announcement on their stance on posts involving sexual or suggestive content involving minors(https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive), i encourage you read it. does your confession include sexual activities and at least one party involved was a minor? not only is it not allowed in r/confession, but it's not allowed on all of reddit. do not post it! 

if at any time you find that a post violates one of these rules (or any rules in our sub), please utilize the report button just under their post. this will alert the mod team of the post and one of us will check in on it as soon as we can. 

keep making this community great!

thanks,

"i'm only losing weight and changing my wardrobe/general appearance to be fuckable.. people always talk about being generally attractive or being perceived as beautiful. i get that. but here's the ugly truth about me: i'm not doing this for a relationship. i'm not doing this to be seen as a potential life partner. all i want--the only thing i live for at this point--is for people to look at me and think about fucking me.

that's it. i want to be an object of lust. i'm sure that somewhere down the line i'll want to settle down with a long term partner. but the goal for me over the next two years is to be fuckable. i don't even plan on having tons of sex with people. i just want to be someone who uploads to gw subs and has hundreds of up votes and comments adoring the way i look. i want to be the person who catches people checking me out.

that's it. it is not for health. it is not to ""feel"" better, though that's a welcome consequent. nope. all this work is just so strangers will want to fuck me. and i don't feel bad about that at all.",11

i've never told anyone about this. at the time i was afraid that i would get in trouble so i didn't tell my mom and since then i haven't really had the opportunity to tell anyone. i wish i would have talked to him. asked him what was wrong and told him that everything was going to be okay. i know that it's not my fault but i will never get over the fact that i could have done something.

"my husband's dirty secret turned out to be much dirtier than i could ever imagine.... obviously using a throwaway account because... yeah.

so over the past few months i've noticed my husband sneaking out of the house at night, sometimes for hours at a time. i'm one of those people that fall asleep as soon as their head hits the pillow, so he obviously thinks i'm asleep, but one night i heard the baby crying and noticed he wasn't there. at first i thought he was sneaking out to see another woman, but it turns out it was worse than that, in my opinion anyway.

we had our first child in february this year, and he's been a really hands-on father. always is there to take care of the baby despite having a full time job when i need a break and all that.

i don't know how else to really say what he's doing without it sounding completely insane (because it kind of is) but it turns out, when my husband goes out at night, all he does is go into the yard where the trash cans are, rummages around, and fishes out a dirty diaper from our child, opens it, and just stands there smelling it. it seems to only be the ones that our son has gone number 2 in, because i've seen him toss back ones that presumably only have been peed in and look for a dirtier one. and then he just *stands* there, taking this deep contented breaths in of our child's excrement. for ages.  the sad thing is, he looks so damn happy when he's doing it too. i've watched him from the window for weeks now, just standing out there, sniffing with this huge grin on his face, and then rummaging around for another.

the real icing on the cake was the other night when he came back to bed, once again thinking i was asleep. he must have got a bit too close to the diaper when he was sniffing our son's business, because when he got into bed with me i could smell something and opened my eyes a bit when i finally heard him snoring and it turns out he had a bit of poop on his nose.  i felt so disgusted.

so i'm at a loss as to what i should do now. i love my husband but this freaks the hell out of me. has this happened to anyone else before? is it a fetish or something? i'm too scared to confront him but i know it needs to be done, and any advice would be great because, i mean, shit.

**tl;dr - my husband sneaks outside at night to rummage around in the trash for our son's soiled diapers and then sits out there smelling them for hours. don't know what the %*#& to do. help?**

edit 1: i'm still awake right now feeding the baby and waiting to see if he'll make a move later on. thinking about confronting him, but not sure if i will or not yet. will update.

-----

edit 2: wow, i can't believe how many people have replied to this post - first of all thank you for all the people who wrote in with such thoughtful advice, i can't reply to everyone but i've read every comment on here so thank you.

i still haven't confronted my husband about what he's doing, and the other night after my update, after waiting an hour or two, sure enough he snuck out again for his nightly diaper sniff. i was planning on confronting him but he ended up coming inside after only smelling one or two, and by the time he came back into bed i was too nervous and flustered to say anything, so just pretended to be asleep. i've decided though that either tonight or whenever he goes outside next (he doesn't every night, but most nights) to take a photo of him in the act and be waiting for him with the evidence when he returns inside. i've never been good with words and i'm just too nervous to sit down with him and bring it up, and someone suggested i photograph/video him so he has no choice to explain since i obviously have evidence and leave him no room to pass it off as me maybe seeing him doing something else. hopefully i can get a clear enough picture that it will be enough for him to realise there's no way out but confront the issue. i'm nervous about how he will react, but i know he loves me and our family and hopefully there is some way we can work through whatever this is together as a family. 

thanks again for all the supportive comments and advice. there has been overwhelming support and only a few weird comments, and i really appreciate people reserving judgement of my family and i.  i will update again once i've confronted him, and hopefully i'll be able to wrap this up nicely and it will be happy endings all round :)

fourteen years you did not own up kate, you ruined me as a guy - i still cant have a meaningful relationship. for you it was just me not manning up and not being a normal kid. for you it was me being a ""fucking pussy"". you were older, kate. you were three whole years older. you were 3 years more mature. two years you had your way with me. i woke up every night kate, i woke up every fucking night, sweating, afraid, trembling.... guess what kate. i still do.

kate is my cousin, my closest friend from childhood. when i was 11 (and she was 14), something happened. my social awkwardness and general shyness meant she was my only female contact. i looked upto her for almost everything. she took advantage of me. our relationship went from being cousins and friends to me being her playtoy and experimentation device. i was afraid to speak to anyone initially. i tried talking to some friends i made at school who promptly told me to man up and stop being a girl. apparently i was lucky to have a reasonably ""hot"" chic at my disposal and a fag for not enjoying it.
i spent months scared shitless about her getting pregnant with my child. finally when i decided to speak to a family member about it, she flipped the story completely. i was branded a perv, a creep and a physho who saw his cousin sexually. not even my parents believed me, she played it perfect. apart from two people in my extended family, no one offered me any supporting words. for them i was everything that was wrong. kate was the exploited poor soul. she had support, she had friends, she had cousins. her friends made my life hell in school. my parents never bothered to listen to my side. the idea of a girl taking advantage of a guy was not very (for the lack of better words) convincing to them.
i begged her for years to help me, pleaded to own up and let me live a semi-normal life. she never did. after 3/4 years of trying i stopped. i thought i stopped caring. i didnt. recently i got in touch with her. actually i initiated contact over facebook. i made up a bunch of stuff about how it was all my mistake and how i loved all those things. over a period of a month and half i plotted like i was going to war against a country. we started talking on skype and yesterday she told me she was a bit drunk. i got her talking, i faked a bunch of emotions and somehow made her say how she loved it and how she made me do those things. i recorded the whole conversation and sent it to everyone in my family.
the biggest bitch was our aunt. some sort of feminist activist (i dont know what she is exactly. she writes some blogs and all and i have seen her quoted on reddit a couple of times.). she was the one who made my life hell the most. she made me look (even though i was 13ish) like i was some perverted fuck. i hope (even more than kate) she listens to that entire conversation. i hope.

***updates***

i still cant bring myself to check emails. that email went to about 15 people and i dont know what to expect. but i switched on my phone to a flurry of voicemails from my mom and one from her brother and one from another cousin. mom is crying in a bunch of them, just asking me to pick up. looks like my parents want to come over today. i sent mom a text not to. i told her i cant deal with all this right now and i will be ok. her  brother just said  ""dude what the fuck did you do that for"" and hung up. the cousin just said he was sorry.

oddly, talking here is holyshitmotherfuckingawesome relief. i have never been this peaceful and calm in years. thanks everyone for listening. thanks for all the supporting replies and pms. i guess i underestimated the power of internet hugs. 

i am planning to seek help. i am going to talk to someone this week. you guys should know you all are unbelievably cool people and that i will forever be in your debt. i guess i am trying to say thanks. 


***update 2***

so i looked down and realized that i still had them gonads and decided to check on emails. expected the worst, but it turned out that i just had one reply. from kate's boyfriend. he said sorry and he told me i could have not sent this to him as all the other people in the list were family(or extended). i guess he is right. good thing is that he is not going to do anything about their relationship based on this, atleast not immediately. roy, you are a good man, i guess. 

her brother called and texted a bunch of times. he is being a dick. the one time i picked up, he told me how i have ruined kate's life. (right!!!!) he goes on a lecture about how this happened when we were kids and i am an asshole for doing this so late. (maybe i am, but i needed closure and i needed this to keep my head sane). 

its not like i didnt give her a chance to come clean. i asked for 3 years, till she was 18-19 to own up. i thought she was adult enough at that age. 

looks like i will have thanksgiving this year! :) thanks y'all. again, brohugs and internet hugs - looks like they work. i have the biggest smile on my face as i type this.

***update 3***

i want to start off by saying a big thanks to y'all. i did not expect this to help me so much, a bunch of random strangers talking to me and giving me support. i cannot overstate how much this means to me. i have a question as part of this update.  so, i know for a fact that my aunt has read the email and has listened to the audio. her comment was something along the lines of me still being wrong and how this doesnt prove anything and finally i should not have done this to kate. apparently i am an adult who cant think like an adult. all the things that happened to me over the years have turned me into some sort of person with an agenda against the ladies. 

i dont have an agenda. some people have suggested via comments and pm to talk to police with this evidence. while that might be the right thing to do, i dont want to tread that path. but my aunt's site still has references to this incident. obviously there are no names. but if someone familiar with this incident reads it, they will know its about me. i found two of her blog posts from 2009/2010 where she uses me and this incident as an example. i would really like to know if there is something which i can do to discredit this. obviously, i should talk to a lawyer  if i need to pursue this. but before i even go to one, i would really like to know if this is possible. more than personal, this is a matter of principles. she shouldnt be using a lie to establish her theory as valid. even if one person reads this, it could have some effect on them. she mentions that she knows both parties. i want those statements removed from the so called ""articles"". is this something which i should pursue or is is a waste of time?

to the good things.

i spoke with my mom. she cried, i cried, she cried more, i cried more, we spoke. she said she could have handled this better. i told her thats all i needed to hear. looks like i am going home this thanksgiving.

"i pooped myself.. i've always bragged that this has never happened to me. i truly believed i have some sort of superior sphincter control. but i've been eating extremely healthy lately...tons of fiber...and it finally happened.

i sharted. at the mall, with my preschooler. she took that exact moment i realized what happened tonthrow herself on the ground (which she hasn't done in a long time) and insist she was done walking. then she screamed. i did that through the teeth mom demon hiss to get up right now or you will never know joy again. so as i'm dragging her as fast as i can to the bathroom, she starts asking why we are going to the bathroom she doesn't have to potty...why are you going so fast mommy what's wrong? are you ok? i have to pull her into the stall with me and the second i pull my pants down she shouts

mommy why is there poop in your panties? oh no what happened?! 
 the bathroom was full, all 7 stalls full and someone in line behind me. so i'm whispering to her what happened and to not say it out loud and she keeps repeating everything i say at the top of her lungs. thankfully it was a little only in my underwear so i threw them out, which led to her trying to fish them out of the garbage.

after, we walked to an aerie because no way i'm not buying myself some cute underwear to soothe this horrible thing that has happened. she keeps loudly talking about it, all the way through the mall, to the store. she tells the cashier what happened.

today has been the most embarrassing day of my life. i shit myself and my kid told everyone.

"me and my friends found 100 dollars on the ground, went to a diner and ordered tons of food. we were terrible to the staff, and when we realized the bill was way over 100 dollars, we ran out of the restaurant instead of paying.. i still feel haunted by this, even though its been 5-6 years. me and my two friends friend found a 100 dollar bill on the floor. obviously, we were super excited. we were 16 years old and the first thing that came to our minds was going to this diner in the upper west side and just ordering a huge amount of food after getting stoned. 

we went, we smoked at central park, then went to the diner, and ordered a shit load of food. we were terrible, we didn't order all at once, instead we did like 5 separate orders of food because we kept getting smaller meals and appetizers. we changed our mind twice and called obnoxiously to the waiter to come back and change our order. we also spilled a whole thing of mac and cheese onto the ground by accident. i could tell he was fed up with us. the worst part is that he was super cool and friendly at first, making jokes with us and all that, but as time went on we were just so awful to him that he stopped being friendly and instead got irritated. 

in the end... the bill was 119 dollars, excluding tip. we were so fucking dumb we just figured that it would be like 75-80, not over 100 dollars, we didn't even do the math when ordering our food. 

instead of apologizing, giving the money we had and saying we would pay the rest back the next day? we ran out of the restaurant. we didn't even leave the money we had. i cant even imagine how the guy felt coming back and seeing that we had left. we didn't even really feel remorse, we just laughed about how ridiculous the whole situation was. 

i feel really, really bad now. ",11
"i tricked three rotten kids into eating ex-lax laced cookies. i worked as a lifeguard at a ritzy country club. a lot of tween-agers spent their summer at the pool.  there were three particularly horrible kids, all about 12 years old.  they would do all kinds of things to get under my skin. one of their favorite tricks was the steal the cookies out of my lunch, which meant they sneaked into the guard office to do it. they were caught red-handed more than once. 

the final straw was when they smeared dog shit (i hope it was dog shit) on the lifeguard chair. 

i baked a batch of chocolate chip cookies, but i mixed in ex-lax chocolate flavored chewables. i used the whole box (24 pieces) and it worked out to about one piece per cookie. next day i put 6 cookies in my lunch, and purposefully stayed away from the guard room as much as i could. it worked like a charm – the cookies were gone when i went to get my lunch. i kept my eyes on the three kids all afternoon but they acted normal.

the next day the three kids weren't at the pool. nor the day after.  i learned from one of their friends that the three had come down with a ""stomach virus.""  at the end of the week they were back and i asked one where he had been. he said he had a stomach ache that gave him two days of diarrhea.

they were such little pricks that i honestly have no regrets.

"i delete all my search history and log out of all my accounts before i sleep incase i die.. every single night i do this because i feel like i'm gonna die in my sleep. and i'm not even that worried about the dying part i'm more worried that someone (my mom) might look through my phone. it's not like i do anything bad or i have something to hide, it's more so because it's just to embarrassing.

"i am partially responsible for the death of my childhood friend.. i've been debating posting this for a few weeks now. but at the end of the day, i think that sharing this is important. moreover, if i don't get this off my chest, i think i'll go crazy. this is difficult for me, so i'm sorry if i start rambling a bit. 

when i was in elementary school, i was the shy, studious, nerd in the class. i had a fair number of friends, so i wasn't lonely or anything, but i was the kind of kid that would always turn his homework in on time, and would always try to answer questions the teachers ask. yeah, you know the kind.

anyways, there was a kid in my class. for the sake of this story, i'll call him austin. you could tell almost right away that austin was a troubled kid. he'd occasionally make fun of people, he'd be loud in class, and he never tried at school. basically, he was one of those kids that teachers would only pass on to the next grade so that they wouldn't have to deal with their shit a second year.

at some time, i think around second grade, we had a paired ""project"" or whatever passes for projects when you're 7. as you could probably guess, i got paired with austin.

now, i hated this at first, but my mother's a psychiatrist, and once told me that troubled kids usually have something going on with them that i don't understand. so, i decided to reach out.

my memory's foggy, as it was so long ago, but i do remember that austin and i, somehow, became friends. i think i might have actually been his only friend in our grade. 

my other friends were like me, and never really liked austin, but that didn't really matter, because i liked hanging out with him, and playing with him at recess. 

one day, we started talking about hanging out after school. i asked him about hanging out at his place, and he seemed to get pretty nervous about it. at the time i remember him being really weird and dismissive about it, but i didn't get why. 

austin might be loud in class, and could be a jerk at times, but if you really got to know him, he chilled out around you. he was really funny, and was a really creative guy, great to play with when you're a kid.

it didn't really matter to me, though, so i just invited him over to my house, and he seemed to be normal again.

i think it was around 4th grade when i asked him, rather bluntly, why we never hung out at his place. he was dismissive and gave excuses at first, but eventually, after years of him being my best friend, he got quiet, and even then i could see how difficult it was for him to say. 

austin told me that he lived with his mom in a small apartment. his dad was in jail, i can't remember why, but i think for something serious. it was his mom who was the problem. i had only occasionally seen his mom in passing, and i remember being confused by how young she was. austin told me she was 24 when he was in 4th grade. and, looking back, knowing the math that means that austin was an accidental teen pregnancy. 

austin told me that his mom drank a lot. i was around 9 at the time, and i wasn't an idiot, so i knew what that meant. i have a vivid and horrifying memory of austin lifting his shirt up and showing me a nasty bruise on his stomach. it was really the first time that i came across the notion of parental abuse.

austin made me swear that i wouldn't tell anyone. and i didn't. i was stupid and selfish and didn't realize how dangerous his situation was. i was afraid of losing my best friend.

now, austin and mine's friendship, i think, was extremely important to both of us. i was practically his only friend, and i was a point of comfort and stability for him. he wasn't nearly as disruptive in class, he became nicer to people, and his grades even improved. it was so noticable that our teacher even held me after class and thanked me profusely for being such a good influence on austin.

but austin did great things for me too. when we hung out together, we did exciting and cool things. we explored, hopped fences, climbed trees and built forts in the woods. we swam in lakes and ponds. we even got in some trouble together. he taught me how to be brave. austin was always more of a free spirit than me, and i was when i was with him. we were the best of friends. 

i don't want to make this sound like some dumbass tear jerker or after school special, but austin legitimately taught me, the shy studious kid that was terrified of breaking the rules, how to rebel, even if it was just a little. we were different from one another, but we celebrated our differences, and were able to help each other improve.

i have a couple of really formative memories of austin, but i won't bore you with them. 

over time, around the time of 6th grade, his rebellious nature started to influence him more. he started drinking and smoking. at that time, i was really taken in by the ""don't smoke, the second you do you'll get addicted and die"" videos that they used to scare kids straight. needless to say, that was a rebellion that i couldn't follow him down.

we were still friends, and we still hung out, but it was really easy to see, especially as we got older, that something in his life was getting worse. namely, good old mom. austin showed up to one day with a black eye. of course he lied and told the teachers it was an accident. i knew, but i didn't say anything. when i would catch glances of small burn marks on him, we'd just pretend that they didn't exist.

it got so bad that we never talked about it. it was like being friends with a ghost, a ghost who was taking comfort in my presence.

around the middle of 6th grade, austin told me that he was moving away. it was hard to learn and accept that my then best friend was going away, and that i likely wouldn't see him again. but, through an admittedly tearful goodbye, he left. he left with his abusive bitch of a mother and i let it happen.

fast forward, and now i'm in college. i can't remember how, but i decide to start looking for austin on social media, maybe even try reconnect with him.

i can't find him anywhere.

i'm worried, as if my memories are correct, he was the kind of flamboyant guy that would definitely be on social media. sure, people change, but that was stretching it. 

a bit confused i did some digging, and it wasn't long before i found a news article on him.

austin hung himself when he was only 14. 

his mom is currently in prison for child abuse. austin's note said it all, and his bruises and scars were more than enough evidence. 

i was devastated. austin, the fun and creative guy who became my best friend as a child killed himself only 3 years after we left one another. i can't put into words how much our friendship meant to me, and how it changed who i am today.

and i was the one who might have been able to help him. if i had been braver, or if i hadn't been such a selfish little shit and put his welfare over my fear of making him mad, then he might still be alive.

i know that i shouldn't blame myself. i was just a kid, or that i couldn't have done anything. but it isn't that easy. sadness, guilt, shame or some primal emotion that i can't name is all i can feel whenever i think about this.

to everyone who's reading this, if you know someone's clearly being abused. help them. and to austin. i'm sorry, my good friend, i wish that i could have been better to you.

tl;dr: i knew about my childhood best friend's abusive parents, and didn't tell anyone. he killed himself not long after we lost contact.",11
"there's a guy at the gym who calls me fat, and i've now stolen his socks and his bananas.. i posted here not to long ago about this guy who is just awful to me at the gym, always laughing at me when i have problems with the machines and is just plain rude.

i've been buying coffee from the 7 eleven across my house and simply put a ton of ice on it to chill it. the actual cold brew coffee from the place i am supposedly buying it from is around $20 for a growler when the 7 eleven dude fills my pitcher for $1.99

"i got revenge on my little brother in the worst way. ok don't judge me but here we go.... so i am the middle child of 2 brothers and we all are 2 years apart. being the only girl had its disadvantages, due to my brothers ganging up on me and trying to beat me up all the time. so when i was like 9 i was sick of it. i knew physically i couldn't get them the way they got me so i had to do something way more intense to get the point across of ""i'm not one to mess with""

my brothers loved playing with ninja turtles, power ranger figurines, cars, legos, etc. they had a huge toy box full of their precious things. so one day while they weren't around i did the most nastiest thing that i could think of, that's right i pooped in their toy box, and the whole time i'm giggling like a maniac thinking of when they will discover my treasure!

so fast forward to maybe 3 days later, my younger brother dumps all the toys out of the toy box and that's when my ears perked up in my bedroom. i start laughing like a maniac (i'm actually laughing hard right now as i type this)! so i knew the exact moment that he discovered my present, he got super quiet and screamed his head off! the whole time i'm crying from laughing so hard! my mom came into the room to find out whats going on and he's crying and screaming (and i'm laughing still in my room like a maniac) 

i picture that he pointed at my poop nuggets while he's screaming. next thing i knew my mom came in my room and whipped me hard, but i didn't cry because i got my revenged and i took the whipping like a champ! 

after that i didn't get into many more physical altercations with my brothers, i think they realized they were messing with someone who will get them in a way they would least expect it!

we each had our own weekly chores to do, and one of mine was to clean our shared bathroom. i figured that if he was dead, i would inherit all of his toys. every week when i would clean the bathroom, i would spray windex into his toothbrush, thinking that it would poison him over time. after a few months i stopped doing it because my dad chewed my ass out for asking him, ""hey dad, if peter dies, do i get all of his toys?"" and that has got to be the angriest most disgusted look that my dad has ever given me.

"i can't stand people that create these ""new genders"". the title says it all. this year has been thoroughly confusingly with these ""more than 52 genders."" don't get me wrong. be who you want to be, gay, lesbian, transgender,i really couldn't care less. but don't make a new fucking gender because you feel different or you have a different attribute. gender was never a social construct. it was a complete biological term used to help differentiate people with different genitalia. hell, even the word genitalia is in gender. a man who wears pink isn't a non-binary demiboy. he is man who fucking likes to wear pink. feminine man isn't a gender. it's literally a man who has feminine attributes. and don't bring up the bullshit argument that gender is what i identify as. if that's true, i can say i identify as god. am i god? no i'm not. just because your stray from the typical male and female norms doesn't make you special. go ahead, idc if you identify as ""agekin"" and think you are four hundred years old, just don't turn it into a gender.

"i pressured my wife into getting an abortion.. at the start of this year i went on a one month business trip. the night i came home she broke down crying and told me that she cheated on me earlier that week. i was obviously furious with her but at the end of the day we have a daughter together and i don't want her growing up in a broken home so i decided to stay and try to work things out. we haven't been on the best terms since then but we've been trying to figure things out. about a month later we found out that she was pregnant. now, i had only had sex with her one time in the last two months - on the night i got back (before she told me that she had cheated) - and i wore a condom, so the baby was definitely the other bloke's.

i can forgive her for cheating but i will not, under any circumstances, raise another man's baby as my own. i told her this very plainly: ""you either have an abortion or i'm gone."" well, she had an abortion two days ago. she's very religious so she's has been really upset about it and has been crying ever since. i can empathise with her but at the end of the day i don't feel like i did anything wrong. i didn't lie to her, i simply told her how things would turn out depending on what she chose and she then, based on this information, made her decision.

"i made a kid cry in front of his friends for bullying my brother; it was the wrong kid.. when i was in my last year of high school, my brother was in his first. i'm in the uk so i was 16 at this point and he was 11. there was this kid who would relentlessly bully my brother, and i mean relentlessly. my brother would be in tears nearly every day because of some shit this fucking kid had done to him. he had tried telling teachers about it but nothing was ever done. 

one day my brother came home from school even more upset than usual, he was covered in bruises and told me this kid and a group of his friends had got him on the floor, surrounded him, and all started kicking him repeatedly. 

so the next day in school i see this kid between classes and i am pissed. i go over to him and in front of all his friends i grab him and pin him up against a wall and say something like:

""i swear to god if you fucking touch my brother again i will beat the shit out of you in front of all your friends"" 

by this point the kid is in tears and saying he doesn't know what i'm talking about. turns out he had an identical twin, and he was the one bullying my brother. i didn't believe him until he showed me his id with his name on it. i didn't really know what to do so i just said ""well tell him to stop bullying my brother"" and walked away.

needless to say i felt bad about it, but he obviously told his twin what happened as he stopped bullying my brother after that.

"i called 911 and lies about a drunk driver. not sorry at all.. my husband was driving me, my four year old, and my 15mo old home from the beach today.  we are on a two lane highway and the person in front of us is going pretty slow.  we start to pass them and they start to swerve back and forth so we cannot get by.  this happens 5-6 times.  and now they are going 50 in a 70mph zone.  it's really weird.  there is no one else on the road so it's bizarre that this person won't let us pass.   then they almost run us off the road as my husband finally gets past.  

we get ahead and this crazy person steps on the gas to pass us.  as they pass us, my husband and i look over and see a nasty, rat faced blonde woman flip us off and make ""chinese eyes"".  

now my husband is white, french.  and he is driving.  he never tailgated this ugly woman or did anything to make her want to mess with us. 

the only motive we came up with for this interaction was racism (because of the ""eye slanting gesture"").  i mean, i'm the only full blooded asian in the car.  she couldn't have seen my half asian kids asleep in the back seat.  and since i'm just a passenger, i couldn't have done anything to offend her.  yet she singled me out with a racist gesture. 

since she put my family's life in danger with her crazy driving, and followed it up with unnecessary hate, i called 911 and reported her weird little shrew face to the highway patrol as a drunk driver.

i hope she had a couple glasses of wine or something.  or maybe that she mouths off to a poc cop and gets arrested.  or gets into an accident pulling this childish crap to someone else.  i hate racists.  

edit: i called the cops out of anger and called her a drunk.  it's easy for me to hide behind the ""well she was acting crazy maybe she was drunk"" excuse.   

this is a confession because i did something bad and i don't regret it.  even if she wasn't drunk and gets pulled over...maybe she'll think twice next time.  she can take her hate and find another outlet. ",11
"i lied to my mom. i was supposed to meet a friend at starbucks and my mom let me borrow her car to go. i went about 30 minutes early to do some homework, at the time my friend and i agreed on, they cancelled. i was upset, hurt, and for some reason embarrassed, i decided to stay for an hour and just continued my homework. 

this is the sad part and where the lie comes in. i don't have many friends, nor do i hang out with friends much so my mom was glad to see me go out. when i got home she asked if i had fun, and as i said before, i was embarrassed and hurt, so i lied and said ""yeah it was fun"" in an exciting tone not knowing how she'd react to the truth. i feel awful lying to her as she just wants me to be happy. i'm so embarrassed and ashamed. i hope in a few years i can tell her the truth and we can laugh about it.

"i think i'm having an affair on my husband.. my husband and i have been married for 6 years. around 18 months ago my husband started talking to me about cuckolding. up until then our sex life was fairly normal. over the space of a couple of months he went from asking what i thought about cuckolding to asking if i wanted to cuckold him to asking me to cuckold him. in the beginning i was very dismissive of it. i honestly thought that he was just testing me - like trying to see if i'd cheat on him if i could get away with it. to be honest, i had no interest in doing anything like that but he kept asking so i finally said that i'd do it.

he put an ad on craigslist and found a guy. as you'd expect, the guy came over, had sex with me and then left. we did this 6 times over the next year. i didn't like the arrangement very much and i felt somewhat violated but i did it for my husband because he wanted it. somewhere around the start of this year one of the guys started coming over regularly (2-3 times per month). during that time my husband and i haven't been having sex at all and i've felt very unloved. so i feel this way about my husband but at the same time i have this handsome man coming over whom i kiss and have sex with and this ultimately creates a weird bond between us. about two months ago i started texting him outside of our direct sexual arrangement. he works about a block away from my workplace so he has invited me to lunch a few times. yesterday after we'd eaten lunch he pulled me to him and kissed me.

my husband has no idea that we've been talking. he is coming over on friday and we're going to do our thing again and i just have no idea how to deal with all of this. i think that i'm having an affair on my husband but i honestly don't know if he'd be upset if he found out. he has been encouraging me to have passionate, intimate sex with this man for 6 months now. how am i not supposed to catch feelings for him on some level? i am so confused about everything and i have no idea what i'm doing or how i feel. i feel nauseous just thinking about all of it.

"i secretly let my dog sleep in bed with us because he was abused as a puppy and i want him to feel safe.. my boyfriend and i adopted a very sweet pup from an animal shelter about a year ago. when my dog was a puppy, he was seized by the police from an abusive situation, and his previous owner is currently in jail on an animal cruelty charge. 

i love my pup so much and we treat him like our baby. however, we have a small bed that can't fit the three of us, so my boyfriend has a strict ""no dogs in the bed at night"" rule. that said, after my boyfriend falls asleep, i lift him up into bed (we trained him not to get into bed unless we lift him up) and he sleeps at my feet. i always wake up before my boyfriend, so he never notices.

i knew she had the same last name as me, i knew she was from the same country and roughly from the same area my family is from—but i never thought to consider i might be related. now i'm just sitting here, having 'nam flashbacks of all the spunk i've unloaded at her instagram pics.

it's two bible toting missionaries. i've already got a faith, knew i wasn't going to listen to a thing they said, but i liked the idea of not being completely alone for a couple of minutes. so i invited them into my house, and let them lecture me about their interpretation of the bible.

"i pretended to be sick to use my insurance to get my uninsured friend medication. part of my insurance comes with free telemedicine consults with a doctor. this happens over video chat via a smartphone app or a website. basically you just video chat with the doc, give your symptoms, maybe give your temperature if you have a thermometer and they give you a diagnosis and prescription if needed. works great for the simple stuff. 

&#x200b;

a friend of mine more than likely has a sinus infection. due to an issue with his sinuses (he hopes to have surgery one day to help but he needs insurance first) it's pretty common for him at a few times a year not having insurance a doc would cost him at least $99 through the area clinics plus who knows how much for the medicine if it's not a generic. he's a good guy in a tough financial spot right now, and he can swing $99 but it will sting. 

&#x200b;

fuck it. i had him tell me all his symptoms and what happened and then popped on this telemedicine thing saying that. i got a script and just filled it. free consult and with my insurance $2 for the medicine. he'll buy me a cheap beer when he's better.

all of my friends are married and all but two of them have children. i've always wanted to get married and have kids but i thought it would just happen naturally. when i was in college i had no shortage of decent guys who were interested in me, but it turns out that college is a rather unique environment. i have focused on my career and my friends for a long time because i just didn't think it would be all that difficult to find someone. anyway, after i turned 30 i freaked out a little and started actually trying to find someone but i'm 34 now and i still haven't found anyone that i want to spend my life with. if i don't find someone soon i won't be able to have children. i hate being such a cliche but i can't help it.

"my male friend got raped and i did nothing to stop it. remorse. remorse

first time here, hopefully i tagged correctly.


it was christmas. my first christmas with nothing but friends getting hammered at my best friends house. we all got each other alcohol for presents naturally, so, lots of harmless debauchery took place.

male and female alike just going crazy drinking, kissing, and sometimes flashing body parts just because. i don't think i've ever drank that much since. but i'm not here to only tell you the fun parts. as the title suggests, shit took a dark turn. 

i won't use real names, just the first initial of their name. s is the girl, r the guy. so, r was always popular. r is an above average looking guy, and no joke, everyone loved him. i mean, the friends of my best friend worshipped this dude. we went to different schools so, i didn't. i think that was why r liked me so much. i treated him like everyone else, when everyone else male or female was just itching to get his approval. 

s was not very popular or attractive. she was always sad, a bummer. once in the military with a decent body to make up for her fuck ugly face, that had gone by the time this party was taking place.

the whole night i remember bits and pieces of s throwing herself at r. r had just broken up with a girl he loved, and didn't want to fuck anything, that was clear. just drink and socialize. i didn't realize at the time how aggressive s actually was that night. it's only now years later i can't stop thinking about it.

we all started to pass out in various locations around my best friends house. r on the big couch, another friend on the other. i slept on the floor because apparently i was the first to fall asleep, and i did so right by the front door (don't remember this part). from this spot i could lift up my head and see r sleeping, and people on blankets sleeping all around me on the floor too.

s was on top of r, when i woke up. at first i thought oh damn, my buddy is getting some good for him. then i realized who it was and knew r had never been interested in s like that so i pretended to be asleep and listened, still pretty hammered at this point but..the noises were...off.

it wasn't hushed whispers, kisses and giggles but more...her making hush sounds and r groaning. i swear he said something like ""what..stop...sleeping..no"".

it's like..i was so drunk i assumed what i was hearing wasn't really happening. i rationalized it like that. i could've gotten up, said something, but i was..not scared but just..mortified. i passed back out, or possibly willed myself asleep to escape what i was hearing. 

the next morning no one said anything or mentioned what i had heard. i shrugged it off as a nightmare, at first. r seemed happy enough, just hung over and like usual a (best friend), r, and i were smoking outside piecing the night back together, reminiscing. by this point, all the others had left so it was just a, r, and i.

""so you got a little action last night huh, r? how was it?"" he looked at me like i had just spoken to him in a dead language. ""uh what? i don't remember much of last night but i know for sure i just passed out on the couch."" at this point a spoke up, apparently without me knowing, he had been awoken by the rape sounds too. ""dude i saw you fucking s on the couch last night, it's cool you don't have to lie, idc lol""

r was visibly upset by this point, thinking we were fucking with him. it took some more of us piecing the night together but eventually he recalled bits of it. i'll never forget the look on his face when he realized we weren't fucking with him. even more chilling and forever stuck in my mind was what he said next, ""why didn't you try and help me?""

i lied and said well, it looked like you were having a good time, i was drunk, i didn't know...so many excuses. i'm a bad friend. i know that. i'm sorry r. if somehow you read this dude, i'm sorry.

p.s. it probably isn't surprising but s has since turned into a sjw 3rd wave feminist. when i see her posts on fb about the evil patriarchy or her outrage over a male raping a female, i get sick. she raped him, and what's even more disturbing is she denies it ever happening. 

fuck you, s.",11
"i can't sleep because of how i treated my mother. when i was a teenager, i came home after school and my mother was lying on the floor. she has a disability that got worse over time, but at that moment she could still walk, yet mishaps like this happened. instead of helping her, i got annoyed and asked her ""what is the point of picking you up if it's gonna happen again, again, and again? you might as well stay there."" she cried after that. and i cry every evening, ever since i remembered.

edit: thank you everyone, just reading your comments makes me feel a lot better. i'll definitely apologize to her.

"update: received open-ended proposition from female co-worker recently, seriously considering accepting. original post here.(http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i6fde/received_openended_proposition_from_female/) wanted to say thanks to all who commented, and for the good advice from many. made me think hard. on sunday, i showed my wife the note and told her i was going to ask to be assigned to work with someone else, and asked her opinion about any other steps i should take. she started crying and hugged me, said she always was suspicious of my colleague, had sensed that she was attracted to me and had been somewhat worried, even suspicious of me a few times (for which she apologized). we ended up talking about it for several hours, and it was wonderful to clear the air with her and get this load off my shoulders.

yesterday, i asked my colleague to go to coffee with me. i handed her the note back and told her i could not do such a thing, even though i had been briefly tempted. then i told her i thought it would be best if we mutually sought to be reassigned. i told her (at my wife's suggestion) that i had spoken to my wife about the issue, and that she had suggested i photocopy the note and take it to hr, but that i didn't want to go that route, and would rather that we both came out of this okay with our jobs intact. (left hanging was the implication that i probably had made a copy of the note, and that since my wife knew, i had backup should any shit later hit the fan.) she was fighting back tears at this point and kept apologizing for putting me in this position, and said she would do whatever i thought was best. so we worked it out that we would both approach our boss together and say that, while we were happy with our work to date, we were both looking for new challenges and, perhaps, new team members. that meeting is planned for tomorrow, and i believe the boss (who is a very smart woman) will get the message and reassign us both without prejudice.

once again, thanks for the good advice, redditors. if there's interest, i will post a follow-up to tomorrow's meeting.

**edit: thanks for all the nice comments, i feel a little overwhelmed. a couple of you raise good points which i want to address.**

**-- yes, i did tell my wife that i had been tempted, and i apologized for not immediately sending the note back. she said yes, i should have done that, but that she understood. (she has met my colleague several times in business settings, and has commented more than once that she is very attractive and is surprised she's still single.)**

**-- clearly, i should have immediately turned down the offer. i never considered myself someone who would stray. i was (in retrospect) kind of obnoxiously proud of the image i had of myself as a good man and husband. that image is now quite different. this has been a wake-up call and i have been doing much more soul-searching than i care to detail.**

**-- looking back at my posts, i have cast my colleague in a one-dimensional light. she is a good person, a very good person. she has been an excellent colleague and everyone we work with has nothing but praise for her. the chemistry between us was almost immediately apparent but i chalked it up to us having very similar backgrounds and outlooks on the best way to get things done. but looking back, i have to be honest in saying that what i thought was just collegiality on my part could have been construed as flirting, and i have to take my share of the blame for that. if she made a mistake in being tempted and sending that note, i made one in not turning her down immediately and in involving other people that would have been better uninvolved.**",11

"my girlfriend's sister kissed me.. my girlfriend's younger sister is in university and as part of her biology major she has to take a differential calculus course. i majored in math when i was in college and my girlfriend volunteered me to help her. she was really struggling with it and she had already failed it once last year. it has been a little inconvenient but i don't really mind.

last night i was just sitting with her at the kitchen table as i usually would. we discussing something to do with pde and then out of nowhere she just kissed me on the lips. i didn't respond at all and after a few seconds she pulled back, looked at me and then just ran up to her bedroom. i waited half an hour but she didn't come back down so i assumed that she didn't want to talk about it and just left.

the whole thing was so odd. there was no sexual tension at all so i'm not really sure why she would kiss me. also, i'm in a relationship with her sister... i haven't told my gf yet and i'm not sure if i should. i also haven't heard from her sister so... i don't really know what to do.

"i convinced my daughter's pediatrician that my she has asthma so i can get free asthma medication through her insurance to treat my own asthma because i'm uninsured.. hey so i wanted to add a few things 

1. asthma in young children often goes away. this isn't something that is going to be on her record forever. asthma can be ""cured"" in a sense because many young kids just stop showing symptoms when they get older. this will be her case.

2. singulair and an emergency inhaler is not dangerous to be on her record right now because there is nothing that it can't be mixed with. they are not dangerous drugs.

3. she is only 5 so doesn't understand anything when i tell the doctor what's going on. i tell him the symptoms are at night and when she runs.

"i found a bunch of poems from my dead daughter, and i don't know who i'm more angry at; her, for making them hard to understand, or myself, because i'm too stupid to understand them.. my daughter has been gone for almost 4 yrs, and i miss her so much. i've always had a lot of trouble understanding her, because she's always been very artsy and eccentric. as time has gone on, i'm pretty sure she wasn't just too 'artsy' for me to understand, i think i'm just too afraid to admit that all this time i've been naive and ignorant. everyone likes to think they're smart, at least as smart as the average joe, but i'm pretty sure i'm freaking stupid. stupid, gullible, and naive when it comes to anything outside my own interests.

i cleaned my daughter's room the other day. it's always been a tough thing to do, and i never actually finish it because it's too hard and i don't want to move anything where it shouldn't go. i'm also afraid of using cleaner that may ruin the atmosphere. i decide to tackle the closet, and even though i've cleaned it before, i somehow missed a shoe box in the way back. it had a bunch of doodles, notes, and poems in it. 

i was both sad and anxiously excited to read something from my daughter that i hadn't read before. but with the exception of like 4 poems, i simply don't understand. i've never been able to get poetry or stories that have deeper meaning. i'm the type that doesn't see double meanings or that the author meant something cryptic, i've always taken things pretty literally. so i'm frustrated, because i wish she didn't make her poems so damn hard to understand. but are they really hard to understand, or am i just a much bigger dumb ass then i originally thought?

i'm still happy i have these new poems, i'm just really pissed at myself and really sad that i can't understand them.

**edit: since some of you have offered to try and decode my daugter's poems, i typed one up. this was the easiest to type up, most of her poems are in very weird formats that i have no idea how to type up on reddit. i will try to post more if the first one goes alright. thank you all for the kind words and willingness to help an old dimwit out!**

**edit 2, thank you all for the kind words and for breaking things down in an easy to understand way. i appreciate everyone who helped me to understand my daughter. it seems as though /u/pods_and_cigarettes was very spot on. my wife confirmed that my daughter was on adderall, and considering my daughter did end up experimenting with harder drugs later before she passed, it makes a lot of sense. it hurts to read this and know my daughter is basically telling me how her addiction started, but i'm still forever grateful that i am able to understand her better. thank you again, kind strangers.**

---

**final edit: i'm in tears as i write this. as crappy as the internet can be, it really makes me happy to see so much kindness from strangers. this is a difficult subject for me, and i started off annoyed at my daughter (i know, that was very wrong) for being cryptic, then angry at myself at being so stupid, and now i am just amazed at how talented my daughter was. i still am no where near good enough to really grasp poems or symbolism, but with help, you've helped me come closer and made me realize that a few simple sentences can tell a very long story. 

it hurts so much to know my daughter was suffering, and i'm afraid to know what else i might find out in her other poems. but i'm so grateful for the chance to get to know her better. i wish it had been sooner, maybe things would be different, but there is no point in dwelling on that. 

i know every parent thinks their kid is amazing. i'm not exception to that. but i wish you all could have known her. i swear she was destined for great things. she was so kind and caring, she truly cared about everyone and i don't think i ever heard her talk bad about anyone, even people who deserved it. whenever i would watch the news in the morning, she would sometimes get so upset by the stories, that she would cry. i never understood that, because although bad things happening to people is sad to me, since i don't know them on a personal level, it's hard to feel anything other than a distant sadness. my daughter seemed to feel everyone's pain very deeply. she said she wanted to write stories and paint pictures that brought people joy, and that she wanted to use all the money she made to help the world become a better place. i think she would have done that, i really do. i wish i had told her how much i loved her art, but she never showed me, and i think part of that is because i didn't understand a lot of it, because i never really tried. 

my daughter was 20 when she passed. the last 2 years of her life was troubling, and some of those reasons have always been a mystery to me and my wife. this not only helps us understand... but i feel like this may give us some closure. she made some bad choices in her life, and i did not want to bring this up because i was scared i would read bad comments about her. i know how harsh the internet can be, and i know i should just ignore them, but reading those interpretations put me in such a sensitive state that i couldn't handle seeing anyone calling my little girl something bad. she made mistakes, but she was still such a beautiful and kind person, inside and out. 

sorry if i'm rambling. i'm so upset, excited, tired, and happy. thank you all again for listening to an old fart vent and taking me by the hand and helping me. i'm going to go take a long nap.**

**final, final, edit** i woke up to a ton of new comments and messages. i am touched and i can't thank you all enough for helping me and sending me such kind words. i really appreciate it and i will try to reply back to all of you, especially those who took the time to write long messages. it might take a few days. also, thanks to whoever bought me gold. seriously, thanks for making me realize how special and wonderful my little girl truly was. i'm so grateful.

"""friends"" ignored my cries for help, so i laid all their secrets bare.. a few close friends went through a lot of emotional drama, breakups between them, love triangles, ""i still love my ex but i can't leave him"" and a ton of bs. one girl was dating my ex who led me on for months, right on until he announced they were dating. everyone knew i liked the 2nd girl, and she was using me to make the 3rd girl jealous.
 (if you didn't understand any of that, just picture how it feels to live it)
 and all of them have been telling me their secrets, most of them hurt a lot. still being heartbroken over a guy, and his new gf is asking you advice over whether she's in love with him or her ex, not fun! they also confessed that they were cheating, lying, or avoiding people, and all the weight really got to me.
 so, i'm borderline suicidal, not mentally healthy, and experimenting with drugs to top it off. and i can't hold these conflicting stories.. 
 
anyways, i put them all in a group chat and sent them their own damn texts. got blocked by three out of four people, but it's not my fault you want to cheat and get away with it.

edit: thank you everyone who has expressed concern for me! ❤️ (also, i feel really bad for telling everyone's secrets, but i felt worse about keeping secrets from the people affected. might have been better to give them a direct warning first..)",11
"update to i really wanna sleep with my new personal trainer.. no regrets 

link to original(http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2azi9h/i_really_wanna_sleep_with_my_new_personal_trainer/) 

so after all the advice and ego boosts i got here, i decided to persue him. very unlike me since i'm a shy person, but something about him doesn't make me feel shy at all. 

he had previously given me his number (without me asking,) so i decided to approach him via text. in case he did reject me, i could always switch trainers and avoid seeing him at the gym. 

i said hey, asked if i could ask him a question. he said sure. with a smiley face. which i felt was important. so i asked if he was allowed to hang out with clients outside of his job because there was a show at a bar down the road from the gym. he texted back immediately saying yes and that he's glad i asked because he couldn't. 

ahh. 

so, last night we went to the show. stayed until about 1am, and we weren't tired and wanted to keep hanging out. him, being really sweet, says super shyly ""i wanna keep hanging out but the bar's closing. would it be weird if we watched a movie at my place?"" he was blushing like mad. i said no, and told him that i've known him for weeks and i trust him, so let's go.

it was cute. we cuddled up on his couch and watched a scary movie. he wasn't too touchy and i got the feeling he's not just in this for a physical reason. if he were, i think we would've just done it and parted ways. instead he had his arm around me and played with my hair until the movie was over. 

he didn't ask if i wanted to stay over, or if i wanted to go into his room or anything. he walked me to my car and asked when he could see me again. we made plans for wednesday. then he leaned in and kissed me. i almost fell over. we kind of giggled about that, i guess it was obvious that i was shaking. we kept kissing for a few minutes before i finally had to pry myself away.

i'm still wondering if i just got belligerently drunk and this is all in my head. so anyway, thanks everyone. this is actually turning into something and i couldn't be happier!

"remorse i am heartbroken over what i found out about my son. my son started middle school and did not know anyone. he said he liked it and was making friends. i asked why he doesn't invite friends over or vice-versa and he says they are all too busy with stuff. last week, i got an email from his teacher. he said that he noticed that my son was spending lunch in the library all by himself. he asked my son why he was in the library and eating with his friends and my son said that he was told that he wasn't allowed to sit with them. my son was so scared about being singled out as the outcast that he'd rather hide in the library than risk being told that he couldn't sit with his classmates. the teacher was shocked because my son seemed to have friends in class, but believes that it's ""sophisticated bullying."" i know it hurts my son because he would not lie about having friends. i feel responsible because i put him in a school where he knew no one because it would make it easier for me to take a better job.",11
"so i'm a college-educated 28 year old male, and i found out that women don't pee out of their butt yesterday.. throwaway because, goddammit. so yesterday, i was walking home with my g/f and we were talking about how penises are really handy if you want to quickly public urinate. 

and then i said, ""well you don't have it that bad, you can just pee out of your butt.""

""what do you mean?""

""you can just pee out of your butt?""

""you think that women pee out of our butts?""

""err...yes, right? don't you?""

my g/f, quickly gaining traction as a ""keeper"" fell down on the sidewalk laughing hysterically and told me to google it, and the image on wikipedia was a cartoon of a woman spread eagle with a nice drinking-water-all-day pee spray coming right out of her lady parts, which up until that moment i assumed was a one-way-street.

i was speechless. how had this basic fact of human anatomy escaped me for so long? on paper, i'm not that much of an idiot. i have a masters degree. i read books voraciously. i have slept with enough women to know what everything is supposed to do down there. at least i thought i did.

i'm the kind of guy that will interrupt you if you say something like, ""isn't it amazing that we know more about space than our own oceans?"" 

and then i'll explain exactly why that's incorrect, citing the expanding size of the universe, solar system parallels such as europa's oceans where we don't even know if life exists, let alone the extent and diversity of its life -- and that's just one moon in the whole known universe, and then look down on you for bringing it up in the first place. i had a relationship that ended right after that conversation. true story. 

so ashamedly with a forensic eye, i've spent most of my night looking at weird girl-on-girl pee porn as objectively and medically as possible. (because what the fuck do you think comes up when you look up ""women peeing""?) and the evidence confirms it. pee does not come out of a woman's butt. it's like a little valve, hidden in plain sight all this time right next to the vagina. i honestly never knew that little guy was there. even more evidence that a woman's lady-parts sure go through a lot.   

i'm not sure who failed me...was it the public schools? my parents? the government? media? society? the church?

somewhere along my life not having sisters, and no interest in pee and sex, i was lead to believe that because women pee sitting down -- that urine must, in fact, come from the anus. in my very tragic defense, i've never watched a girl pee before. i'm always as far away from the bathroom as possible if a ladyfriend has to evacuate herself. 

of course now the more i think about it, the more logical this seems in terms of human development. after all, a vagina is just an inside out penis (or a penis is an inside out vagina, depending on how you want to look at it). but i haven't been able to sleep for the past few days, just thinking about this. 

on a scale of 1-how-the-fuck-did-you-not-know-this, where am i landing at exactly, reddit?

tl;dr - women don't pee out of their butt.",11

"i lied to everyone: my ""accidental"" craigslist baby. this is long, but it's everything i needed to say.   i had a baby with donated sperm from a man i met via craigslist. 

i am a woman in my middle 40's.  i'm smart, friendly, kind, helpful, active, and interested in the arts and sciences.  i have a decent job and live in a mid size metropolitan area. 

i am not being coy when i say i'm ugly.  like, really ugly.  for real.   it's plain and simple that i did not make out when it came to genetics.  i have never had a boyfriend and i've never been loved because the one thing you are not allowed to be if you are a woman is ugly.   

hell, i'm so ugly, i don't even have that many friends.  the only sex i've had has been with men who were too drunk to care. the ones who, after their beer goggles wear off in the morning, probably feel dirty and ashamed they hit something as ugly as me and swear not to get that drunk ever again.  all this while they make as quick an escape as possible.   as if ugly is catching.   i have often wished i were gay because gay women don't seem to judge each other as harshly as men do. 

that's the honest truth.   i'm okay with knowing i'll never have a boyfriend or husband, in knowing that i'll never know the love of a partner.  it hurts, sure it does, but i've also come to accept my lot in life as far as that's concerned.  also, now that i am ugly and in my mid-40's, i have suddenly become invisible and that feels better somehow.  side note: please remember that ugly people can be pretty nice, cool, interesting, funny, kind wonderful people! those traits do not disappear just because someone is ugly. 

for a long time i naturally assumed that meant i wouldn't ever have children either.  no husband = no children.  that part hurt a lot.  i knew i'd make a really great mom if someone would give ugly a chance. no one ever did.   but duh! then it occurred to me that one day i could try to have a kid if i damn well wanted, husband or no.  this is *my* life and i only get one shot at it. i should do what makes me happy, do what i want in my life so i don't have major regret later.  i don't have any addictions or mental health issues & i'm a good person.  so i decided to have one! 

i had a few problems, though. 

1. judgement from friends and parental wrath (they are religious) 
2.  i'm older for someone trying to get pregnant so it would cost more money than i have for ifv/donor sperm or adoption.  all that stuff is expensive.  

my parents probably would have disowned me, i never would have heard the end of it - to try to have a baby out of wedlock??  the horror!! the *sin*!  my parents don't let shit go - harp harp harp.  my father has a nasty, mean streak too.   i didn't need the stress, so i kept it 100% to myself, even my best friend doesn't know.  she would judge me and try to talk me out of it.  she's not a kid person, she's very against children and speaking on zero population growth, etc etc.. downright hates kids.   and so *her* feelings about children would be projected onto me. this is the first time i'm telling anyone the real truth. 

i also certainly could not afford ifv, fertility treatments or to pay for donor sperm, etc.  adoption is also crazy fucking expensive!  

so i did the research and came up with my own, semi dangerous plan. 

i am in my mid 40's so my chance of conceiving is lower but i've had a regular period forever so i hoped my chances were still reasonably good.   step 1. so i read up on fertility treatments & purchased clomid from an overseas/online pharmacy clomid is a drug that is used to help women ovulate.   step 2: donor semen.  did you know that there are men on craigslist willing to donate their sperm to help women  conceive?   i think it's mostly a fetish for them, but who cares! i trolled craigslist for a few months, interviewing about 8 different men. i weeded out the guy who only wanted to do it naturally and wouldn't do a donation in a cup --  as to me that was suspicious.  if you are willing to donate why does it have to be penis in a vagina?  so yeah, i weeded out the those men, men who wouldn't agree to be std tested, men who just seemed weird. 

after much search i found a very reasonable man.  i told him the truth, that i was ugly and therefore couldn't find a mate but wanted children.  he was fine with that.   he is married with 5 children, has an advanced degree, a professional position and was willing to do a donation in a cup. that he was wanting to donate in a cup, that right there told me wasn't a craigslist creeper.  

his wife know and approves of what he is doing.  we met for coffee a few times to get to know one another.  he was decent looking, cordial, friendly and was wanting to donate to help women and couples who couldn't otherwise conceive.   he had already donated to 2 lesbian couples and 1 hetero couple who needed it and all three of them were successful & had children.  he also donated to one other single woman who was older like me, but she couldn't get pregnant after 1.5 years of trying.   all of his connections were via craigslist and all because doing it through proper channels is very, very expensive.  he did all of his donations via cup, not the natural way & had been std checked recently.. plus had a lab report to prove it.  totally on the up and up and an all around nice person. 

we didn't sign any papers it was a ""i'll trust you if you trust me"" kind of deal. 

i tried for about 10 months, tracking my ovulation with a thermometer, etc.  i would tell him i was ovulating and we drive to meet that day. he would jerk off into cervical cap and i would place it inside me.   sometimes we had to meet in a parking lot some where because that's how our schedules overlapped, and i kid you not, this will sound creepy but he had a van, which made it much easier to do the jerk off then insert cup thing.    month after month of disappointment.  i was beginning to think i was just too old. 

i then decided to go ahead and invest in a clearblue easy fertility monitor.  it was $200 with the sticks but turns out the best thing i bought!  basically you pee on these sticks each morning, the monitor the reads how much of whatever hormones it checks for and tell you how fertile you are.  turned out to be a great investment and one i wished i'd sprung for earlier in the process.   i got pregnant on the 2nd month of using it!   

i told everyone that it was an accident.  my parents were supportive of me keeping it because to them abortion is bad blah blah religion... and so far my friends have been supportive too.   

i had an easy pregnancy and easy labor and delivery and now i have a healthy baby who is under 1 year.  i don't want to say exact age or gender.  it was the best thing i ever did - i've never been happier.  it's going to be a struggle, but i feel fulfilled as a human being and as woman.   i'm every day extremely grateful to the man who donated his sperm to an ugly girl to make a beautiful baby. 

i may be ugly, but it turns out i'm an excellent mother. 

edit: for everyone telling me i'm not as ugly as i think i am and all that - i was born with facial deformities that can't be fixed.  so yeah, ugly for real.

"my coworker is a wannabe red pill pickup artist who has been trying to use his rp game on me (as one of his platonic female friends). i am fucking with him by treating him exactly like the women he fucks.. no regrets

my coworker dates multiple women and strings them all along via ""alpha"" behavior (plating, i think they call it), emotionally manipulating them to be at his beck and call sexually while simultaneously downplaying and mitigating their own emotional needs. he is very misogynistic and holds a very low opinion of women in general. he is very proud of being able to ""land"" any woman he puts his mind to, even though he is average-looking and not in that great of shape. 

he has not come out and said he is a ""red pill"" guy, but he is very active online and it would not surprise me in the slightest if he ascribes to that philosophy - his behavior certainly mirrors that. he even bitched about being friendzoned to me the other morning by a girl who had the nerve to take her shirt off after getting drunk at his apartment, but then later (sober) telling him she wasn't interested in him as anything more than a friend. in response to this, he cut the friendship off cold.  

to his credit, his whole asshole attitude towards women apparently kind of works (at least with a certain class of desperate women, anyway), and i'm sickened that anyone regardless of their gender would let themselves be treated as a social/sexual commodity like that. but whatever - different strokes and all. i'm not fucking him, ever, so i don't care much one way or the other. 

as his friend though, i hold him at arm's length in a way i've never done with my other friends. i'll go hours without answering his texts just to make a point that *i'm* not at his beck and call. sometimes he'll call and i won't even bother answering for a couple of days. 

a few weeks ago he cancelled plans to go to the movies with me and made a point to tell me he had made a date to have sex with another woman he met the night before. my less-than-interested response to this revelation - ""eh, fine, whatever, not like the theater is going anywhere"" noticeably surprised him. awalt? not quite bitch.

it's like he was expecting me to jump up and get jealous of her or something, or upset that he broke our plans for another woman. sorry bro - i don't give a shit one way or the other. 

the next day, after i didn't give him the expected reaction to him cancelling our plans, he texted me and wanted to drop everything i was doing to spend time with him. i told him i was busy with some other people and blew him off. 

i am aloof and show only marginal interest in his romantic conquests, which he feels compelled to talk about in detail. i don't disclose mine at all. he constantly tells me about sex with these women as if he's trying to make some kind of an impression on me about what a don juan he is, and i just shrug at him. i allude to doing things with other people on the weekends, but don't invite him to do anything. i make him invite me everywhere and wonder if i will show up. 

and guess what? he does. he acts just like one of those clingy, dependent, emotional women rp guys are always getting so high and mighty about. 

it's almost like my perceived lack of interest in him just makes him even more interested in me. which is hilarious, because my sexual interest in him is exactly 0% and that's exactly how much sex he will ever get out of our relationship. 

not every woman can be played. especially when they know the rules of the game. ",11
"i am the reason my wife's best friend left her.. no regrets 

like the title says, i am the reason why my wife's best friend left her. i do not regret my actions and i would do it again without a second thought, but i don't want her to know the truth. using a alt/throwaway because she knows my main account. 

about 10 years ago, when my wife and i were still dating, her best friend, who we will refer to as ""n"" got her hooked on shooting up pills. dilaudid, to be specific. if you've dealt with addicts that shoot up, you will know there are two kinds. those who shoot because they feel like they have to, and those who seem to get off getting other people to try it. my wife was the former, while n was the latter. i did notice a pattern. as long as n was not really involved in her life, things were good. she could easily stay clean. but should she be exposed to that stuff (99.99% of the time n was involved) she had the hardest time being clean, and often relapsed. we had a long talk about all of this, and no matter what she wouldn't cut n out of the picture, no matter how much or how badly n fucked her over. i still do not know why that was the case to this day. she moved in with me later that month, and decided once and for all that she wanted to build a life with me and wanted something better than addiction, but she never did cut ties with n. about a week later, she relapsed because of n. i had enough and decided to take things into my own hands. n came over to my house one day when my wife was away, and i knew this was my chance. i met n at the front door with my .45 handgun. i made it clear to her that she was to cut all ties with my wife, and to never show her face anywhere near our home (she lived a couple of towns over). i told n that if she ever did contact my wife again or even come near us, i would gun her down right where she stood. when she said i was full of shit i cocked the hammer and put my finger on the trigger. she got the message and left. she never did contact my wife ever again, and she moved away somewhere. my wife still doesn't know why exactly n cut ties with her. she has been completely clean ever since. we have been married for 8 years and have 2 kids together. 

only me and n know the truth of what happened. i just wanted to get this off my chest. 

edit: holy hell, i really did not think that this would have blown up the way it did! thank you all for the kind words, before i go on i want to make it clear that i do not condone my own actions then and i don't want any of you doing what i did. i am not a violent man by nature, and frankly that could have gone so wrong. pretty much the only reason why i did what i did was because i felt there was no other possible way i could intervene at that point. i loved (and still do) my wife more than anything, and my thought then was going for broke. all, or nothing. fortunately, i won. here are some answers to questions that some of you had (pm's and comments)

>will you ever tell your wife the truth?

i've considered it. i probably will after our kids are grown, but that is about 20 years away. 

>are you worried about your actions coming back to haunt you?

no. after this happened my wife and i both moved clear across the country. we had been planning it for some time before, and this really spurred me on to get serious. we were both moved within about a month of this. the only real social media we really even use is reddit. n is a junkie, not a super spy. i'd sooner expect half life 3 to come out before her finding us.

>did you get your wife therapy? what was the deal with her drug use?

yes, i did get her to go to therapy for about two years. i got back the woman i fell in love with because of it. she did have some prior drug problems in her teenage years, and was clean for about 4 years (coincidentally, that sobriety ended when n came back in the picture for a little bit). since then, she has remained clean for over 9 years now, still going strong.

>why the hell did she not cut n out?

my theory is because they were childhood friends who weathered abuse together. that will forge a hell of a bond. n was the one who got her on drugs in her teenage years, and again in her early 20's (when this all happened). i think the only reason n remained friends with her was a, because she could mooch drug money off of her, and b, because if her friend was doing drugs, she wouldn't feel bad. 

>would you have pulled the trigger?

at that time my blood was boiling pretty damn bad, so i think there is a good chance i would have. i am glad that it didn't have to come to that. don't get me wrong, i still want her to get what comes to people like her, but not by my hand. i would prefer it be by her own. 

also, for some reason a lot of you want to see this series of events as a movie. not exactly my taste, i prefer a good western movie. but hey, to each their own. again, thank you all for your kind comments and messages, i really appreciate that. god bless. ",11
"i did gay porn to support myself for two years in la remorse. i moved to la with the dream of making it big. i am one of the many who failed. 

i took everything i owned (very little money) and drove to la. i was able to rent a basement  studio apartment, a shit hole. i worked as a bouncer in my home state, and a guy i worked with gave me the number to an agency that supply's bars and events bouncers/security. the pay was shit but the hours would allow me to do auditions during the day and work at night. i found some shitty talent agency, at the time they promised me steady acting work ect ect. months went by, struggling to make rent, zero acting jobs, and then i hit rock bottom. my car broke down, and since i wasn't able to drive to the events i couldn't work. i used uber for two weeks straight and it averaged that i was paying more for uber then i was making working. at this point i stopped doing auditions, and i was in pure survival mode. 

i called the manger at the staffing agency and told him my situation. he asked me where i lived, and when i told him he asked if i wanted to work the door of a gay bar that was a hour walk / 25-30 min drive from my apartment. i told him yes and i started that night.  i should have left la that day. but starting that night at that bar kept me in la for the next 3 years. 

it was a medium size bar, most of the bar was a dance floor facing a dj booth. most of the people who worked there were struggling actors/ people trying to get into the industry. there was a lot of drug use among the staff and i definitely took part. i worked the door with another struggling actor, and we became friends. he was always flashing his cash around . he drove the nice bmw, always well dressed ect ect. one night i finally asked him how and where was he getting all this cash. he told me that the owner of the bar is an investor  in a internet company that shoots and produce gay porn. he makes roughly 1000-2000 a shoot, and may do one or two shoots a day. i was shocked, and even more shocked by his next question. i will never forget it. ""if you want in, they are always looking for guys like us."" 

i met with the bar owner the next day, and that week he set me up with an agent, got all the medical test, the agent payed for all the medical, the waxing, and two weeks from talking with my ""friend"" the bouncer i was on set for my first scene. i was going to be in a group scene and i would be payed 500. i was given viagra and i got undressed. when the director saw me nude. he came up to me looked at my dick asked me how big i was, and then   lhe asked if i would be interested in waiting 4 hours to do a different scene. a one on one and he would pay me 2500. i am 6'4 built, and i was doing a scene with a skinny 5'3 dude. it was my first time having sex with a man. 

the next three years i did about three scenes a week. mixed with all the coke and alcohol it felt like 10 years. thankfully i stayed clean in the sexual transmitted diseases department. but the life i was living took its tole. eventually i found help, and now have been clean and sober for a year. my life is still a struggle but i am in a better place. one day at a time.  

i regret what i did, how low i valued my self worth, for doing things with my body just to pay the bills, destroying my body with drugs and alcohol. 

it felt good to get this off my chest.

"my son may not be my husband's.. my husband and i had been under a lot of pressure because his boss was making him work longer hours and i was struggling at home with our first child. since he was busy all the time i asked one of my (male) friends to help me put together my desk. afterwards we were sitting on the couch having a drink and he started giving me a foot massage. after a while he started moving up my leg and... i don't know.. we just... we would up with us having sex. i had been feeling really unloved and alone and he made me feel sexy. it was a huge mistake and i regretted it immediately. 

we had been married for 3 years at the time and we had a baby girl together and i was terrified of what would happen if i told him, so i kept it to myself. i immediately stopped talking to the guy that i had sex with and i've only really talked to him one time since. several weeks after it happened i started getting morning sickness and my husband recognized it and bought me a pregnancy test. he made me take the test with him and after we found out that i was pregnant there was essentially no going back. our son is 13 now and i'm still not sure if he's my husband's (biologically). i've never had him dna tested to check and never will because i don't want to know and i'm not sure if i could deal with it if i did. when i looked at him yesterday he looked a lot like the other guy and that's why i'm feeling guilty right now but sometimes he looks exactly like my husband as well so i'm honestly not sure. my husband has helped raise him since he was a baby so he will always be his father, that's what really matters.

"i'm a college student living in a van.. no regrets

i'm 21 right now and last year i got kicked out of my house, forcing me to get a roof over my head. instead of the usual route of finding a roommate, signing a lease, and being stuck on that lease no matter how low on funding i get, i decided to get a van.

i took out a small student loan, bought a van, built it more suitable for living, and have been living out of it ever since. it's probably the best thing that's ever happened to me.

for starters, living out of a van still costs money. you can't be dead broke and be comfortable with van life. i pay car insurance, gas, my phone bill, food, and maintenance. my monthly living expenses cost around $500~ per month. that's still as much as an apartment with at least one roommate and nothing more than my part of rent so i can't complain.

electricity is trickier. i don't have solar panels because i don't think it's 100% necessary and they're a dead giveaway that someone lives in the vehicle but i do have multiple portable battery chargers for my phone so that's never died on me. i also have a macbook air with a long battery life and a 2nd back up battery. during the semester i usually hang out in the library for 4-5 hours every other night and charge them both to 100% before i leave. i've never ran out of juice as i don't use them much in the van. my stove is gas powered and i have some battery powered items laying around. there's nothing i use that needs a heavy power flow. a 12v adapter would be enough for all of my items in a pinch as i have an upgraded battery and alternator. 

for internet on the go, i have a hot spot with unlimited lte data so i can average around 5-20mbps depending on where i am. obviously bigger cities get me better signal. i also have a external wifi antenna that gets great range if i need to park outside of mcdonalds or wal-mart.

food is all non-perishable and if i really want to keep something cold i have a 12v cooler that stays around 34ish f or i have a cooler to throw ice into. the 12v cooler is a pain to use because there's always a chance of draining your battery so you'll have to run your car every so often to charge it up in the middle of sleeping as a just in case but it comes it handy. ice in a cooler is preferred as it will keep items cold for at least 48 hours and then you technically could drink the cold water that's leftover if you want. to cook food i have a gas camp stove with 2 burners. it's great, i have no complaints besides gas being an on going cost.

combating cold is a lot easier than combating heat so sleeping in the winter, not so bad. sleeping in the summer, hard. i have a roof vent fan that sucks all the hot air out of the car but it only does so much. the night time is manageable but you have to go to bed later and wake up earlier to beat the sun or you'll fry. i usually move as up north as possible due to colder lows during the night but it still hits above 65f most of the time. i recommend pitching a hammock outside and use that for sleeping whenever possible as the car will be much hotter than outside with the windows up. also, using something to block out the sunlight in the windows but that only does so much too. basically, you'll get used to sleeping hot. winter is just adding layers.

stealth isn't always needed. i go to a lot of free campgrounds where you can camp right outside of your car so you don't need to be stealthy there. if stealth is needed, i usually just sleep in a wal-mart parking lot. my van blends in pretty well so nobody has ever given me problems. i've never slept in a neighborhood as that's just asking for trouble, neighbors will automatically know your van has not been there before and they will be suspicious. 

hooking up is actually easier than when i had a residence. download tinder and take a bunch of candid shots with your van on adventures, then upload them saying you're on a journey around america and just looking for short term fun. as long as your van is up kept, newer, and you're up on your personal hygiene, you should be okay. being college age also helps a lot as you're ""young and dumb"" instead of ""old and gave up on life"" but that's just my point of view.

income is different for me. my college is completely free with a scholarship but i'll take out a small loan for summer living so i usually am not working but i'll still likely have a serving job in the summers for a couple shifts a week. i work a lot more during school as i do not use a loan to cover school living. 

i love van living, i could spend a week on the beach drinking margaritas then decide i want to visit the grand canyon and head out the next day without a care in the world. i can spend my times in the desert, city, or rural communities. i could find myself at a number of national parks, hiking away, at anytime or in the middle of nyc or pitching a hammock in the middle of nowhere. every day is what i make it and that makes it so worth it.

sadly, after college, this life won't be as feasible anymore as i want to enter the workforce and live a ""normal"" life...",11
"i jerked off at school. so, this girl in my class was looking good that day as her dress showed off ample cleavage. she just happens to be at the study area as well. my primal urges kicked in. my boner was not giving up. i did the one thing i thought i would never do. i went to the bathroom. occupied a stall, waited until the coast was clear and blew my load into a wad of toilet paper. i was disgusted and a little turned on as well. jerking off in that bathroom was kinda hot. don't judge me.  i cleaned up and went straight to studying again.

"confession about my husband.. i love my husband very much. we've had a child together, we've lived together and have been happily married for about 30 years. i feel like i'm with my best friend. 

that being said, he's always been a very passionate cook. he always brings me breakfast in bed, he makes me dinner, he really enjoys being in the kitchen.

i've always kept it a secret, but his cooking is terrible. since he puts so much heart into it, i always eat it and act like it's the best thing ever. i will never tell him my secret. i've been silently suffering for a long time.",11

"no regrets i didn't have sex with my tinder date because of her poor hygiene.. i met up with her and she looked nothing like her tinder profile. the plan was to go to my place and watch a movie. i felt bad so we did that anyway. while she was there we started talking about tinder. i jokingly pointed out that her photos look nothing like her. she let me change them to resemble her more. after that we started getting into the sexy stuff which i didn't really want to do but i haven't had sex in a while so i thought why not. she took of her pants and i smelt something very weird. i assumed its something outside so i closed the window. after a few minutes i took of her panties and i noticed the smell was coming from her female parts. i quickly looked at my phone and told her i have to get to work. i walked her to her car and ran back home. she messaged me for couple of weeks after that until i blocked her.

"in my younger years i committed lots of credit card fraud. in my late teens, for a family vacation my dad had rented a minivan.  upon returning home, i went with him to return it to the rental agency at the local airport.  as the serviceperson was closing out the rental, and taking another customer's phone call at the same time, i noticed something written on a sticky note on the counter.

4 groups of 4 digits, then two pairs divided by a slash.

a credit card number!

being this was the late 90s, and the internet as we know it was in its infancy, i was mildly versed in the illicit online antics of the day.  i had copies of the anarchist's cookbook, hacker's handbook, terrorist's handbook (which more than half was just a copy/paste of anarchist's, but i digress), netbus, subseven, all the fun toys that the ""computer nerds"" would use to cause mayhem in their boredom.  and spying on those wonderful digits i knew i could have some fun.

so i pulled out my little sharp wizard (oz-640) that i got as a gift since i had a thing for portable computer devices back then (foresight maybe? lol) and, slowly read each number block upside down and typed it into my little pda, closed the app, saved.

fast forward a week, and while visiting a friend's house i mentioned to her brother that i had swiped a cc number.  being teenagers with access to the internet, we wanted to get so porn.  back in the day, 'adult id' was the go-to people for free porn sites, but you had to have a 'adult id' code to get in.

so........we bought a lifetime pass with the stolen card. $69.99. and our id was muffdive69.

that poor key got around for a few years if you know what i mean.

along with my newfound digital porn pass, i discovered a ""bug"" in the dial-up provider formally known as prodigy online.  apparently they had a two week free trial for anyone who signed up, and after that they would then charge your credit card and continue with your service.

remember how i said i had the anarchist's cookbook?  well in there was a few sets of phony ids and a few fake credit card numbers.  i used those to create a new account every two weeks, and continued to use the stolen card for many other digital services for almost 3 months before the card got flagged and shutdown (because lets be honest, it was safer buying digital codes and keys than buying actual stuff since that stuff has to ship somewhere, and that's how you got busted back in the day)

many years of digital mischief would continue until i settled down (even wireshark'd a comp. science student's university login at a local panera for more free internet. you'd think a cs student would know not to use pop3 over unsecured wifi)

i love my fiance so much. he was my high school crush when i was a freshman and he was a senior. we matched on tinder 5 years later and now we're getting• married.

"i sexually assaulted multiple women when i was a teenager.. every year my middle school would throw a carnival at the end the year. my 8th grade year i had been watching a lot of youtube videos on how to talk girls. what the videos boiled down to was be confident. however i misinterpreted being confident, with doing whatever the fuck i wanted. so during the carnival i would walk around and try to flirt with girls, and if they reciprocated with a laugh or smile at one of my jokes, i would take it a step way to far by grabbing their butt, or poking their breasts. i even tried to motor boat a girl. the girls would usually, laugh or smile, but looking back they were definitely uncomfortable, and were just trying to get me to leave them alone. fast forward a few months later, and i'm in high school. me and my friends were sitting outside after school, when one of our classmates asked us if we had any change she could borrow. i stupidly said, ""if you want my money your gonna have to earn it."" then proceeded to poke her boob. i started chuckling to myself, but quickly realized no one else was laughing. there was an awkward silence. the rest of the incident went down like this.

girl: ""what the fuck.""

my friend: ""what the fuck dude."" then proceeds to slap me in the face.

me: gives her the money in shame while trying to apologize.

girl: walks away without saying anything.

i quickly realized after this instance that what i was doing was definitely not ok. i somehow never got reported at all for this behavior, and was never punished, and i think that's what bothers me the most about this whole ordeal. the fact that i never got what was coming to me. it's been years since this happened, and all i can say is that i was a complete creep/ass hole back then, and i'm not even gonna try to defend myself. i've thought about reaching out and apologizing to the people i assaulted, but i don't want forgiveness for what i did. i feel like if i were forgiven, what i did would somehow become ok, and i don't ever want what i did to be ok.",11
"it's been 20 years since my brother took his life due to the abuse we suffered when we were kids. i'm still waiting for my turn.. i'm 37 now, my brother was 15 when he decided to hang himself. our childhood was pretty fucked up. back when we were younger there wasn't a lot of attention to abused kids. especially if the abuser was related to you. our parents married young and their marriage was doomed from the very start. my mother saw that and decided to have kids as if that would make it better. it did until it didn't. 

since our father worked she would take care of us but in reality she would often leave us unattended and hungry at home while she would take walks. our father couldn't speak on it because she would threaten to hurt us. i was 5 when she started to beat me up pretty bad. i would often have bruises and she would always make sure that my brother could see her beating me. she got a lot smarter too. buying us tons of clothes and toys so people would praise how much she thought about her children. she would switch doctors often too so they wouldn't pick up anything weird. she got a lot of praise for that too because she would say that she wanted to hear as many professionals as she could to make sure we would get the best treatment. 

meanwhile, we would be getting beaten and starved. she would sometimes lock us up inside of cabinets and leave us there. she would also makes us sleep on the ground. to be honest there isn't much i remember from that time besides the stuff she would do to us. she would often threaten our father so he would buy her stuff and keep his mouth shut. she would say that one day she would set the house on fire while he worked and she was the only one who would survive. she would often tease us with lit matches.

she would also make up excuses saying that our immune system was very weak and that we would be homeschooled. which pretty much hindered our interactions with the outside world. she would also use the different doctors to back up her claims. at this point we had a lot of development issues. my brother didn't talk at all and i would only talk broken sentences.

it was only when my brother was 5 that we escaped this hell. or so we thought. my mother took us for a walk which was a surprise for two kids who never left home. she made a stop on a store a few blocks away from our house and there she asked the cashier to look after me so she could take my brother to the bathroom at our house nearby. she never came back to pick me up and it was only later that the police arrived. 
my brother was only found at night. she had left him in a bus and the only reason he came back was because the driver knew our father. my brother was a wreck. he was so swollen from crying. our father told the police that she was on meds and the police didn't really care much and just allowed us to go home.

she never came back home. after a week our father took us to live on another city. we didn't get better. we never learned what my brother went through with her. he never really learned how to speak properly. he would talk very slowly and very quietly. almost like he was whispering. he wouldn't leave the house either and forcing him to do so would cause him to have severe mental breakdowns. mental care wasn't good at all so he never had access to a proper healthcare. 

the thing that haunted us the most was the fact that our mother had vanished. so we would always be waiting for her to open the door and start beating us up again. it was common for us to have panic attacks and nightmares. we would spend days in bed with fever and hallucinating. it was hell.

entering the teen years was even more horrifying. our mental health got even worse and i guess this is what took my brother away from me. one night before dinner we found him hanging by the neck in his room. this somehow was the thing that broke me. because i was the one supposed to suffer first. i was the one who was supposed to be hurt first so hopefully he would be spared.

"no regrets i am letting my homophobic coworker sink. i work at disney as an office assistant. i am slightly older (40) than the people (under 30) who i support. yes, it's odd taking direction from people who were starting kindergarten when you were starting college but i make good money and get off at 4pm everyday.

i like my department except for this one guy. he is all show and no substance. he gets by on his charm. i felt bad for him because he is the office affirmative action hire. we were cool in the beginning, but that changed when i causally mentioned that i was gay. i neither act nor look ""gay."" no one cared that i was gay. all of a sudden, this guy acts uncomfortable around me. i am not even into black guys and i think he feels like everyone who likes penis has to be into him. i ignored it until i found out that he jokes with other guys that they should ask me out on a date. also, he would try to throw me under the bus to cover up his mistakes, doesn't even say ""thank you"" or ""good morning."" when i took a day off to attend my father's funeral, he was the only person in my department who did not sign my condolence card. he does not treat his ""bruhs,"" people with vaginas or his supervisors like that. this would be a non-issue if he did not ask me for so much help to do his job.

so i get my revenge my exploiting the fact that he is an affirmative action hire who gets by on personality. i refuse to help him. he asks me for something and i tell him to leave it in my inbox and never get to it. if i do, i do it at the last possible moment to fuck with him. my favorite is assuring him that i will get around to helping him and never do. then i tell him that i was too busy helping others, specifically his and our bosses. i also cc his boss on every email to him so he would be too scared to email me. 

i got to a point where i was going to forgive and forget until he tried to get me to sign off on falsified documents. i would have gotten into trouble over that. i emailed him about that and never heard back from him because he doesn't want to admit that he is doing that. now he's trying to get other people to do his job and they are seeing that he is clueless and a burden to work with.

"girl cheated on her boyfriend with me, and after telling him the truth he didn't believe me. some context: this chick and i knew each other in high school and we had some small sexual tension that we never really explored because she got pregnant by some other dude.

flash forward a couple years once we've graduated and she finally broke it off with her baby daddy, and is dating another guy who also went to the same high school. this new guy was in the army and was stationed pretty far from us. she decides to hit me back up saying how she missed our friendship and that we should catch up. she was always so nice so i decided to take her out to some delicious ramen and then a cute movie. it didn't take much to wow her and we were already making out halfway through the movie. after the movie we don't really want the lil date to end so i suggest we chill back at my place. once we got there we started making out again and fucked. afterwards she tells me that this is our little secret and not to spread it. i agreed and only really told my closet friends who i know would never spread my business.

flash forward a month or two, i see that her current boyfriend messages me on snapchat which is odd, i forgot i had him added. he said ""be real with me, did you and girl fuck?""

honestly i just left the messages opened trying to figure out whether or not to tell him but then i got a little empathetic because if i had a girl i would want to know if she's messing around. so i told him ""yeah"" and just he just took a screenshot of the messages. i figure he already knew which was why he was messaging me  directly. 30 minutes later this chick starts calling me saying ""hey my friend told boyfriend that we fucked so if he asks, just tell him no.""

""oops i already told him, sorry i felt empathetic. i don't know why your friend leaked our business but don't get me involved in this drama""

she then starts to freak out over the phone like ""noooo no no no noooo this can't be happening what the fuckkk""

i hung up cause i was at work but i still feel her blowing up my phone but i don't answer cause her constant calling killed my battery. i get out of work a couple hours later so i charge up my phone and called her asking what happened. i was surprised she even answered and she sounded pissed. she just hanged up after i asked what was happening and gave a huge ""uugghhh"" before she hung up lol.

i noticed that the boyfriend messaged me saying ""shut up pussy, you can't get none""

at this point idk what to even say so i just replied ""lol tru"" i'm just sitting here baffled that this chick somehow convinced her boy that we didn't fuck and that i was just joking. like damn her deception game strong af lmao

tl;dr: i fucked a chick with a boyfriend and when he started asking questions i told him the truth. somehow the girlfriend convinced him that i was only joking and he just called me a pussy who can't get none lol

she had a fat ass doe 👀

"i'm not as smart as i thought i was.. i'm a senior in high school this year, and will be graduating come june. i have had all a's throughout high school except for last year when i got my first b. if it weren't for that b, i would have been valedictorian. 

i like to think that i deserved to be valedictorian; that i am truly the smartest in my class. however, this past year has shown me that i'm really not that intelligent, and that there are many others who are much smarter than i. 


also, i'm kind of an asshole about how smart i am, at least to myself. i'm always telling myself that i was cheated out of an a, but deep down i know i deserved that b. not only that, but i should have gotten b's in several other classes as well, but i somehow managed not to get them.


recently i took the sats as well, which i got a 1900 on. i figured i was just being lazy, and could have gotten a much better score if i tried. so after taking them a second time, i thought i did much better, but i only got roughly 40 more points than last time.

when i was younger i always believed i could get into mit, but it has become painfully clear that i stand next to no chance of getting in. i 
now realize that i am probably going to go a lame local college and stick with my family. ugh. 

oh, and to top it all off, the only hobbies i have are videogames and reddit. no extracurriculars at all. hell, i don't even have my license yet. but none of this has to do with my intelligence; i'm just rambling.

"when i was pregnant i found out my unborn baby had down syndrome so i had a termination and didn't tell anyone.. recently i terminated my pregnancy after finding out my baby had down syndrome. i was 14 weeks pregnant and at that point i hadn't told my husband as i only found out 2 weeks prior that i was pregnant in the first place. 

i found out the results after i had a cvs scan. i was completely devastated because i wanted the baby, but i just don't think i could raise a child with down syndrome. i know it can be so rewarding and humbling and in some cases children aren't effected a lot by it but i couldn't take the chance. i'm not prepared for it. 

i'm not sure how others would've handled this situation but i only did it in the best interests of my self, which may be selfish. i have a heavy feeling in my heart and a guilty conscience. i think i'm going to have to go to the grave with this, even if it eats my alive. my family are strong catholics and are heavily against abortions.

"i am the reason why 9 people are dead, and no one will ever do anything about 5 of them. remorsethere will be a **tldr** at the end of this post in order to not ruin it for those who wish to read the long form. people looking for more information than will be in this post may wish to listen to the podcasts about my mother's disappearance (officially, in fact, her murder): http://thinairpodcast.com/?episode=episode-2-marie-ann-watson-part-1

i found this forum a year or so now, i suppose. i've watched and read and lurked. so many times, i've started this post and deleted it. again and again... 

i've watched people say they want to die because they failed grades or they don't feel good enough for whatever reasons. sometimes even people with family say it, and honestly it breaks my heart to see that. i've also seen people admit they cheated and admit they hurt their loved ones, sometimes in quite bad ways.

i suppose i keep feeling like my confession doesn't belong here. i grew up with no one believing me. now, since there's evidence (since 1996) that can be pointed to, people believe me--but only what they want to believe, but not the rest of it.

yet i've lived with this almost my whole life, and it has gotten worse since they reopened the investigation into my mother's disappearance. learning what i have since then should have alleviated my guilt, but it made some things that much worse.

exceedingly long story unbelievably short ahead: 

when i lived with 'foster parents' from age 3 to age 7, i was abused beyond what most people can stand to hear described. it felt like an eternity of pain and terror. much of it was literal torture. 

part of the torture i experienced was brutal sexual assaults. one of the ways that they used to make me pretend to ""want"" what they were doing to bring me such terrible pain was to beat other kids if i didn't comply. it worked for a while, but i quickly learned that they beat the other kids and raped them anyway, so i quit complying.

eventually, the foster 'father' started to choke them. they choked us for punishment, though, so i still didn't accept that they would kill them. so... he did. the first one he killed to prove to me that he would do it if i didn't stop crying and pretend to participate willingly. 

the second boy he killed in rage, to get even with me. the third was because i just couldn't do it. i tried so hard to stop crying, but i simply could not. the pain was tremendous and there was nothing i could do. i watched as his eyes stared into mine in terror and then i watched as they closed. 

then comes the really bad, ugly, horrible part. the part that gives me nightmares and that makes me feel like a monster if i dwell upon it... the next two? they died because i decided that. i intentionally didn't cooperate. i looked into their eyes, and i saw the suffering there, and i believed we would never escape. yet here, they had a way to escape. there was, for them, a possible end to their pain.

so i didn't obey. at the age of 6, i chose death over life for two other people, with deliberation and intent. i did not kill them with my own hand, but they died by my decision. i was 6 or 7, and i played god. i prayed every day to jesus that i would be free, that i would be 'saved' in a literal sense. one day, i knew. i knew and understood that no one was ever going to save any of us. we were all going to be tortured forever--this was hell. death was the only way out... and they made sure i never died. i was blond and blue-eyed and fragile and thus a favorite to beat and rape and torture.

that's not all. that's not the end of people who died because of me. my mother was murdered by the same people. she was trying to get my brother and me back, so they killed her. if i hadn't have been born, none of it would have happened. her husband left her because i was born. proof beyond question of infidelity... my family never let me forget that i was the reason she died. i was the reason the marriage fell apart and when my mother wouldn't split myself and my brother up, he went to the same monsters i did. 

i destroyed all of their lives, just ask them. 

one of the foster brothers who i remember helping murder my mother is on death row in california now. http://murderpedia.org/male.r/r/rogers-ramon-jay.htm he was taught how to murder and how to get away with it... because of me. he went on to almost get away with 3 other murders because he learned from killing my mother how to get away with it... 

before my mother died, i begged her to take me with her. to leave and never come back and just hide us... you see, the fosters warned me that they'd kill anyone who tried to take us away from them.... i asked her to take me away and then they butchered her. i have lived with that pain and guilt and shame for most of my life. sometimes it still burns inside me.

so when i see people saying how worthless they are, how horrible and how they don't deserve love or happiness... i can't help but wonder... when i am so much worse than they, do i also not deserve love, happiness, or hope?

i don't want to be told all the nonsense of how it wasn't my fault. the mind knows, and sometimes so does the heart, but not always. i don't want to be told that i was just a kid. i was never just a kid. not a single day in my entire life.

**tldr**

i was violently sexually abused and during that time, it was ""pretend to enjoy the agony or we'll kill these kids"" and so the kids died, because i simply couldn't at first and then later i decided they were better off dead than living in the hell we were in. my mother was murdered trying to get me back and then as a result of that, one of the murderers went on to kill more people since he learned how to get away with it (but he didn't get away with their deaths). i was the reason my mother's marriage broke up and she was in that situation to begin with (according to my family). **end tldr**

the police won't do anything because they can't prove anything. nobody believes me, anyway. so i will live with this for the rest of my life and that's that. there's nothing i can do, and nobody cares about those children. i am hopeless to ever see resolution to any of it, and every once in a while i am okay... but sometimes... sometimes i'm not quite okay. 

i have nobody to talk to about it. i talked with shrinks of various types and i have one now... but it doesn't help and it's beyond the realm of what even most of them can cope with. 

sometimes, i wish my life wasn't so horrific that other people can't even hear about it. sometimes, i wish someone would sit and listen and not disbelieve me. sometimes, i just want to be normal and not sit there listening to someone tell me how horrible they are while i sit there knowing how much worse i am, have been since i was a child. sometimes, i want to pretend i'm someone else. to pretend that my parents were happy married all their lives and just recently died and that i'm normal and everything's fine and nothing ever happened... 

i also sometimes want to punch people in the face for telling me how strong i am when i'm crying inside and aching and feel sad, pathetic, and far too fragile.

and at times, i despise people who have family and they don't even know. they don't even have a clue what it's like to live an entire lifetime without any at all. they hurt their family and sometimes they even gloat about it. they sit there and look me in the face and tell me how they hurt a family member and they don't know that they're talking to a person who, as a child, squatted at the corner of a building and watched while her own mother was butchered like an animal... their life is so very hard because their parents are angry, you see... or because their sister lied, or because they found out that their parent had an affair... 

it could be worse. ",11
"i killed two people, and i felt nothing.. it was years ago, but it haunts me to this very day.  this wasn't a premeditated murder or revenge or a drug deal gone wrong. it was just me being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and i acted purely on instinct to protect myself.

i was a junior in high school and had just gotten out of class on friday when my older brother called me. he was taking his best friend, chris, kayaking that weekend and he wanted to know if i could go. i drove home as fast as i could and met him to load up our kayaks. we left home around 4:30 in the afternoon. 

after driving for five hours on the interstate, we exited and drove to a gas station to fill up. my brother stayed with the car while chris and i walked into the gas station. i noticed two guys in their mid-twenties arguing with the cashier when we walked in, but i ignored their yelling because the whole situation made me feel uneasy. i worked my way to the back of the store where the restrooms were.  

the yelling got even louder, so i turned around to see one of the men with a blue north face jacket holding a pistol up in the air. he yelled ""enough!"" and brought the gun down and shot the cashier in the head. he started shooting into the store and breaking the glass doors to the refrigerated drinks. i freaked out and hid behind the closest display and started to hyperventilate. a manager came busting out of the back office right by me and he had a pistol, too. he tried to shoot the assailant, but he wasn't quick enough. the man in the north face jacket shot the manager in the chest, and he collapsed about ten feet from me. 

he was bleeding everywhere. the blood was just pouring out of him from his chest and he was struggling to breathe. i crawled over to him since i had learned first aid as a boy scout. i applied pressure with my hands, but i knew it wouldn't make a difference. he was bleeding from his back too and the floor was slippery from all the blood and it was all over my knees from trying to help him. i realized he wouldn't live without immediate medical attention. the man in the jacket started shooting again. he shot the lights over the hotdog display that i had last seen chris standing by. and then everything slowed down and become incredibly vivid and clear. i wiped my bloody hands on my shirt, reached over the manager's body, grabbed the pistol, pulled the slide and stood up. i had fired a gun before. my dad taught me when i was younger. i aimed at the second man and shot him in the leg. the recoil of the shot caught me off guard because it was much more powerful than i expected. the man in the jacket turned around and looked me in the eye. he seemed shocked that i had just shot his accomplice. he kinda shook his head like he had no clue what had just happened and then he started to raise his own pistol. i shot him twice in the chest and he fell backwards and dropped his gun. his accomplice was screaming in pain and started to crawl towards the gun on the floor. i started yelling at him to stop moving but he didn't listen. as soon as he reached the gun, i shot him in the back twice, and he didn't move anymore.
i remember the police coming and asking me to sit down on the curb outside while the paramedics got the manager. i remember the clarity and the vividness while i was holding the gun slowly fading as i told the police what happened. the paramedics asked me if i was hurt because i was completely covered in blood. i remember my brother sitting by me and putting his arm around me while they asked me millions of questions and different police officers told me i had done the right thing. i remember going to some type of insurance case thing for the manager where i told a bunch of lawyers and police officers what had happened. i remember a man coming up to me and saying i had saved the manager's life by doing what i had done. i still see that man's shocked face as he turned around and saw me holding the gun. i remember the look of confusion he had as he fell down with two gunshot wounds in his chest. i remember everything about that night. out of all the things i remember, i don't remember ever being asked how i felt having just killed two people. the only thing worse than nobody asking is the fact that i felt nothing. absolutely nothing. and that is what horrifies me. i killed two people that i had never met, and i felt absolutely nothing while i was doing it.

"i pretended my dad hurt my neck while cracking it so he wouldn't do it again. so i have a lot of boundary issues and i hate people touching me. my dad is a wonderful person but he would always insist on cracking me and my siblings' backs if we (foolishly) mentioned any kind of pain. i hated it and it was a huge ordeal so when i was about 16 i pretended that he hurt my neck, i started crying hysterically and hammed it up for a full day.

"i accidentally killed my foster kitten and i feel like a monster.. i've been rescuing and fostering animals, mostly cats and guinea pigs, for over a decade. i've never lost even a tiny kitten to illness. recently i've been fostering 4 kittens and their feral momma. they were about 2 weeks old when i got them and i had to bottle feed them because their mom wouldn't feed them. i love them to pieces. they're big now, over 8 weeks and turning into amazing little cats. 

tonight i was cleaning my office, which is the kitties' home base as well as where my rats and guinea pigs live. i was almost done cleaning so i let the kittens back in. they were immediately underfoot, and then, it happened. it was so fast. i tripped on a kitten and then my foot came down on him. hard. 

he ran for a second and then i picked him up. it was awful. he died in a few seconds. i hope to god it wasn't painful. he was such a perfect little angel - last night he climbed up in my bed and slept with me. i will never ever forgive myself for this. i know it was an accident but it still happened. i did it. he's gone. my whole life has been about saving these tiny lives and i ended one. 

i have so many awful feelings that i'm almost numb. i don't know what to feel. i don't think i deserve to cheer myself up. how could i be so careless? how could i do this?",11
"i drowned a tortoise.. when i was 17, my kid sisters found a large ""turtle"" on our patio. thinking we were going to be heroes, i drove the creature with my sisters in tow to a nearby lake and set it free..

i thought to myself ""wow that's very tragic. that reminds me of-""

i'm so sad. so so sad. 

the images of the bubbles coming from the tortoise while under water immediately crushed me. while my sisters and i were feeling proud of ourselves for sending off ""george"" as we called him off to ""turtle college""; george was actually drowning right before our very eyes. 

i feel terrible and still haven't found a way to tell my sisters. from now on i'll always make sure. i hope this post pushes someone to look up the difference between the two before deciding to ""save"" their george. :(

"i dislike seeing parents with their severely disabled child.. if its something the doctors didn't catch until after the birth, or something that happened in an accident then that's understandable. hell,veven children with down syndrome live a very happy life, i've seen many shows about them living a fulfilling life. but i just don't understand knowingly having a child with a severe disability that will grow up having to be took care of 24\7. 

a lady came into the store with a child with a feeding tube and was confined to a wheelchair. he just sat there moaning or screaming, and drooling as if he was in pain the entire time. couldn't move hardly at all. i felt so bad for both he and the mom...they both looked stressed.  the child will never find love, or experience life at all for that matter and i just don't see myself carrying a child like that to full term. im sorry.

"why i quit smoking... i started smoking when i was about 12-13. i am just shy of turning 32 and 6 months ago i quit smoking from 25 cigarettes a day to zero, no patches, no aids. i just stopped and never told anybody why..

13 years ago when my daughter was born i promised myself i would quit smoking. 2 years ago when my son was born, i also promised myself i would quit smoking. my parents would nag me to quit, my government raised the price of a pack to nearly $20 almost a full hours pay per day was going on smoking and i didn't mind.

then one day i am out the front of work and a regular customer comes up and starts harping on about how she has stopped smoking. she did patches and now had stopped smoking. i was always happy when somebody made it out. smoking is fucked, i had physically known that for years but i was hooked.

then as i went inside i got angry with myself. here is this lady i had always considered low class, borderline white trash. she had done it, made it. she was free of the addiction and here i am, better then her, still addicted.

the next morning i woke up, brushed my teeth and didn't go for a smoke. i just stopped, patches are for the weak i told myself and i was better then her.

so i hereby confess that i was not strong enough to quit out of love for my children, my life, my money or my future. but i was strong enough to quit out of jealousy and out of the desire to be 'better' then somebody else.

"i'm an awful person for this mid thrust moment. i've (23 f) been out of the closet gay for about 5 years now. about 3 years ago i linked up with a friend from high school (m 20 at the time). our small school community was going through a rough time with the amount of suicides occurring. so we checked on each other to see we were doing & such. we always had a thing in hs but never acted on it because we were always dating someone. we decided to catch up & hangout at his place. he wasn't aware that i was gay so he was super flirty & nice the entire night. when he started to try to hold me hand i awkwardly laughed & asked him what he was doing. he shyly said he didn't know & just wanted to hold my hand. so i accepted & soon enough brought up the fact i was gay. he said that he felt dumb & i told him not to feel that way because we always had a thing in hs & if i were to ever be with a guy it would be him because he was/is the sweetest guy i have known. he said he didn't know what to do because he still wanted to kiss me so i decided to try having sex for the first time with a male. fast forward about 6 mins & i'm just not into it - it's not the same feeling i get when i'm with another female. so, literally, mid thrust i tap his shoulder & say ""you can stop now, i know for sure i'm gay"". being the person he is asked if he should stop & did - i am eternally grateful for how he handled it. i just feel like an ass & still do.",11
"i broke up with my self harming, suicidal girlfriend because i couldn't take it any more. (tl;dr at bottom). conflicted
i am just a sophmore in high school. i was dating a senior in high school, one who i met last year and had an almost ten month long relationship with. it was a great relationship. we never had a real fight. any disagreements we had we would talk calmly about and rationalize together. it was a great relationship, but there were a lot of problems with most of them centering around her. i will go into these problems to try and justify to you, and myself as to why i broke up with her. 

**she has zero self control.**
she has lots of body image problems. she wasn't obese, even by medical standards, but she still had lots of loose fat. she didn't like this, but instead dieting, exercising, or simply just reducing the amount of candy she ate, she instead turned to purging and randomly refusing to eat for days at a time, before binge eating again. 
she could not, or would not try and stop herself from purging. she gave into all of her desires and would not stop herself. i would need to physically hold her back in order to stop her from running into the bathroom and forcing herself to vomit. 

**she would self harm on occasion.**
she would not stop herself, she wouldn't even try, no matter how many of her friends told her not to, tried to help her, or tried to help her find other ways of coping. she would always turn the razor onto her arms whenever she started having a mental break down. 

**she couldn't find happiness on her own.**
she would not find hobbies to do. she would not go out of her way to try and make her day better, she would rely on other people (e.g. me) to make her day better for her. 

**she needs lots of attention, and i mean lots.**
this past week was finals week so i spent a lot of time studying or working on personal hobbies in order to clear my head. i had to put my phone in another room in order to stay away from reddit and be more on task.
this was a problem for her because i was not texting her enough, which led to her feeling like our relationship was falling apart and that she needed other people to fill her attention gap. this led to her cheating on me. 
she was also texting multiple guys other than me, essentially all the time. 
i don't text any other girls at all. i'm nothing more than casual class friends with other girls. if i texted with any other girls to the same extent that she texts 2+ other guys, she would have instantly become jealous and angry. 

**she's a flirt.**
she cheated on me by kissing another dude. she put herself into a position where she was alone with another guy in a car and made him think that it was a good idea to lean over and kiss her. she then went back and kissed him five more times. 
i know this because she told me about it earlier in the week and had a self hating mental break down, cutting her arm 30+ times, purging repeatedly, and crying all night. she promised never to cheat on me again. i believed her, for all of like three days. 

**despite all of this, i loved and helped her.**
i would comfort her while she cried. i would tell her that mistakes that she made were just mistakes and that they weren't the end of the world and just to not do it again. i never held this against her, even though i really, really wanted to. 

#this all came to a head yesterday, a few hours before we went to an expensive restaurant for our 10 month anniversary.

we are laying down on her bed and watching kitchen nightmares together when she received a text from a guy saying something like this 
""hey, earlier when we were at (location), i almost leaned over and kissed you."" 
i read this over her shoulder, she glances at me, covers her phone slightly, and starts to type. i say ""ew gross, no. you have a boyfriend."" 
she responds to this text message with ""oooo"" 
not ""no."" not ""i have a boyfriend."" not ""sorry i'm taken."" 
but ""oooo."" 
if you don't know enough about social trends between texting teens ""ooooo"" leads someone on. 

i confront her about this on the spot, but she says that she doesn't want to talk about it and doesn't ""need this in my life right now."" 

i then start texting my trans friend about it. i practically trust this guy with my life. i've known him for years and helped him break through an addiction to pain meds in 8th grade. i need someone to talk to about this. 

she then gets very angry about me telling one of my friends, so we get into a calm, verbal argument about it and i ask her how she would feel if i were getting texts like that and i were leading people on. 
she continues to say ""i don't want to talk about this."" 
i then text my mom that i want to get picked up from her house because i don't want to be there anymore. i tell her i need some time to think about things and she gets angry and says ""why don't we just end it right now then?"" 
i say that i don't want to break up, but i also don't want to date someone who leads on other guys. she protests by saying ""it's just who i am, i'm a flirt! i can't change that."" 

at this point i'd practically had it. i've been extremely patient with all of her problems, but at this point it's really starting to affect me now. i don't want to date someone who openly cheats on me then turns around and refuses to fix herself. 
i break up with her and then leave her to cry in her room as i go find her mom, inform her of what just happened, and ask her to watch her tonight so that she doesn't self harm again. 

after a few minutes of listening to her sobbing uncontrollably and saying things like ""i can't do it anymore"" and ""my depression went away with you, it's going to come back. i can't handle it coming back!"" my mom pulls up and i leave. 
---
#my justification.
this wasn't a healthy relationship. she was dependent on me for her happiness. she was dependent upon me and her friends for her to not self harm. 
she placed huge expectations on me as a boyfriend. we would see each other for 5+ hours every weekend, 3 times a day at school, and occasionally hang out on weekdays. even then, she felt like she wasn't seeing me enough. 

she couldn't help herself at all. even though she knew that this relationship was very good for her, she jeopardized it by cheating on me, promising not to cheat, then turning around and leading on other guys only days later. 

i understand that a lot of the problems she faced are hard. self harming, bulimia, and body image issues are not easy things to overcome, but she never even seemed to try to overcome them. she was completely dependent on others to try and stop her. 

i struggle with self harming on occasion because my extreme anger issues lead to me striking out at myself, usually by punching myself in the head. but i'm getting over it. i'm dealing with it and working through my problems. she won't. 

i have mild body image problems because i was medically overweight, just on the cusp of obesity. but i've lost 25 pounds. i'm working on it. 

i find happiness in the hobbies that i pursue. i play piano, i write stories for fun, and i sing in choir at our school. she refused to ever try and find choir to be fun, instead seeing it as a drain on her life. 

i no longer want this girl to be dragging me down. i don't want to have to deal with someone who requires constant attention, constant support, and demands huge portions of my time. it's mentally and emotionally taxing on me to try and prop her up all the time. i broke up with her for myself. 

i have some regrets. even though there were flaws, what we had going was pretty good. she loved me and i loved her greatly, but it just wasn't working out for me. she may cut herself because of me. she may purge because of me. she may be depressed for the next couple of months because of me.

but that's her choice. she is the master of her own life and her own decisions. i am the master of mine. i choose to go a separate way. 

#tl;dr: i broke up with my suicidal, self harming, bulimic girlfriend because it was too emotionally taxing on me. 

edit: we've talked a bit since then and i think she's handling it fairly well. she's not calling for me back yet (but it's only been <24 h so we'll see). her therapist is making her go to a kind of intensive therapy again, which should be good because she won't be able to harm herself there. 

she tried to get me back once by asking ""if i would have said no would we still be together"" which the answer is yes, but only for a little while. she needs to fix a lot of her problems before i would consider getting back together with her. 

also, she texted the guy who said ""i almost kissed you"" and blamed our breakup on him, saying that he ruined it. that's not really true. he was just a horny teenager who wanted to get into a curvy girl's pants. yeah she's taken, but ultimately it is her fault for leading him on and showing so much interest in him, then failing to deny him when he pushed it further. 

i wish i knew who he was so i could explain things to him, but i sadly don't. 

edit 2: thanks for all the support. as the post gets more popular, i won't be able to reach everyone. 

edit 3: i am do not plan on getting back together with her until i get into college *and* she fixes the problems that she is currently dealing with. until then i'll stay away from her apart from the casual wave in the hallways. ",11
"i was a shitty kid to an awesome dog. i was a young, stupid, angry, depressed kid. we had an awesome big lovable oaf of a dog. all that dog wanted was love and attention. i only realized it when i was older, and he was literally a week away from being put to sleep. we aren't bad people, i was the bad one. my dad was hardly at home working two jobs to support us, and my mother was absent for reasons i am not going to say here. 

it was my responsibility to take care of the dog. walks, food, attention. i remember days he would howl and whine for attention, and all he would get is me yelling at him to shut up. he wasn't allowed inside, even on -30 degree weather. (we had a garage with a heater in it   and big cushy beds for him so he wouldn't freeze). and times where i was the only one around for a couple days, and i would only feed him and then go back downstairs to play games. it hurts to say that more than once he has gone without food or water. i would get back from school and he would see me walking up the driveway and he would jump around excited and i would walk past him after a pet and he wouldn't see me until the next morning when i left for school. sometimes i didn't want him to get excited so i would be as quiet as possible so he wouldn't hear me. this got easier as he got older and his hearing left. ( now i am crying )

when i did walk him, at least 1-2 a week, i wouldn't let him sniff or have any freedom, just a quick walk around the block. sometimes i would walk us in the middle of the street so he wouldn't sniff anything. lots of times i would yank him to keep walking.

years went on, he outlived 3 other animals we had. eventually our family stabilized and he started living how a dog should live. walks, attention and love. he had this for the last year of his life. later, i eventually grew up (emotionally and mentally), got help and therapy. i walked him every day for my benefit and his. little did i know, shortly in the future he would be put down. he was getting old, difficulty walking and standing up in the morning. we've been giving him pills for a while by this point, but it was time. i was fucking breaking up. i discovered the most lovable dog, realized all the shit i did to him, all the lonely nights he had and trying to make up for it. only to learn he was basically on his deathbed.

i remember the day of, and i was sitting on the lawn with him and he sauntered about sniffing the grass and trees. he was too old to play fetch now, so i sat there holding his kong dog toy. boy did he ever go through those toys like crazy. i knew it was time, my parents and the vet were in the back yard ready for him. i called him over, hugged him and took off his collar. it's amazing how loose it was on him now. his thick muscular neck was so thin now. i never noticed. i couldn't be there with him when he took the deep sleep. i went to my room, placed the collar on my dresser and wept. its still there. 

we found some old pictures, and this is why i made this post. it keeps reminding me how awful i was, and how much of a great dog he was who only wanted love.

"my mother used to make me dress and act like a girl.. my mom used to make me wear dresses and makeup. she made me play with dolls and my room at my mom's house was essentially that of little girls room. i stayed with my dad for one week and my mom the other. when i was with my mom, the only time i was allowed to dress or act like a boy was when i was at school. when i came home, she instantly made me change into girl clothes again. i wasn't allowed to play soccer or lego or play with the toys i actually liked; she would only let me have dolls. i also wasn't allowed to have my friends over. she told me that i would be ""in big trouble"" if i told anyone about it. she used to take me to a (at least i think it was a) mother-daughter group. i remember that she would sit with the parents and i would have to go and play with the other girls. she made me sit down on the toilet and only let me go to the girls toilet when we were in public. i don't know when it started or how long she made me do this for but i remember hating it.

when i was 10 i started living with my dad full-time and i've only seen my mother a few times since - the last time i saw her was on my 13th birthday. i've never talked to my dad about it and i'm not sure if he knows. actually, i've never talked to anyone about it.

"i pissed off a local gang member and was so terrified of telling my family that i made up a lie that i got a job in nyc and had to leave as soon as possible.. i was a really dumb kid, like ridiculously dumb. i grew up in baltimore. i partied a lot, did drugs, sold drugs sometimes, but i wasn't the worst of the worst or even close to it really. we lived near gangs and heard shootings a lot but i was always sort of on the periphery of that kind of stuff. 

&#x200b;

anyways, i was 19 years old, at a party. i had no idea whose party it was but it was a ton of fun. while drunk me and my friend were upstairs and we found a big bag of pills, like one of those big zip lock bags, filled all the way to the top, in the back of a mini fridge in one of the bedrooms. we  drunkingly took the bag and put it in my friends book bag. then we left the party, laughing the entire way, talking about how we were gonna split it and all that. it was a white boy party in pigtown, i didn't expect anyone to come after us. i woke up the next morning, my friend had the pills in his bag. i realized that it was an absolutely terrible decision, and right away regretted it, but i also realized there was no real way out of it. i just hoped nobody found out. 

&#x200b;

anyways a few days later my friend beeped me like 7 times in a day (this was 1998) and i called him and he said that people were saying that people knew it was us who took the drugs. and that it was the property of some guy named mikey who was coming to find us, who was apparently a gang banger in west baltimore. he said he heard it all over his high school, and his high school was way more gang infested than mine, so i knew what he was saying was true. he said he was going to new york the next day to go live with his cousin to lay low for a bit, and that i can come if i want. his moms didn't give a shit if he lived or died, so i don't think she minded that he was leaving. my family though? both parents are educated and normal and everything. i couldn't just leave out of the blue. hell, they got worried if i was out past midnight on some nights.  

&#x200b;

so i told my friend (name is jordan, my parents have met him once) to help me create a lie by using his cousin to call my house phone and call my name, then tell me all about a job that he could hook me up with. it worked perfectly, he called my house phone, put on the best old-white-guy accent he could, and mentioned that i had asked about working with him in new york before and that a position opened up. i came home and my parents were thrilled, and they told me to talk to the guy right away and call him back. i called him back and he started yelling at me saying i better not be in his house for longer than a few days and that i owe him for that bullshit he pulled to get my parents on board with that. i still laugh thinking about that whole scenario, it felt like something out of movie but at the time i was so scared that i didn't even think about how ridiculous it all was. i just wanted it to work. 

&#x200b;

my parents were suspicious at the idea that i had to leave the next day, but i told them that i had a friend who was there that i could stay with and i wanted to set up in new york for a week before the job started regardless. this technically wasn't the first time i had left home, i spent a year in college before. the job was a 'low level journalist job' which is what i told them. i told them i would call them everyday. 

&#x200b;

then me and jordan drove our ass to new york that night. freaking out but also kind of... oddly happy that we actually got away with that. guess what? jordan fucking brought the big bag of pills. i suppose i wouldn't know what to do with it regardless, but i was pissed at him. it was oxycodone and e pills, sort of separated in the bag by a weird sheet. oxycotin wasn't a thing yet i don't think. 

&#x200b;

i stayed with jordans cousin and he was really aggressive and rude towards me when we first met. i was kind of terrified by him, but we eventually became closer friends. he was aggressive because he thought i was a gang banger and wanted me out of his apartment asap, but he slowly found out i wasn't and warmed up to me. he also warmed up to us when he found out we had a bunch of drugs. it helped that he had a huge apartment with a spare bedroom. anyways, i eventually found a job, got my own apartment with two roommates. jordan went back to baltimore after like 7 months and was apparently fine. 

&#x200b;

and i kept up the stupid, ridiculous lie that i was working as a journalist at ny1, a local news station. i provided no evidence or anything to support this, i tried to keep contact with my parents as minimal as possible. i eventually told them i got laid off, but that i had another job, my real job, set up for me. its funny, because something like that would never work today. they would have googled ny1 and realized there was no way my uneducated self could have gotten a job there. i didn't even know what it was, but its a major news station in nyc. 

&#x200b;

anyways, that is basically the entire story. i love telling it, although for quite a few years i didn't tell \*anyone\* because i was still so scared of getting found out by 'mikey' or whoever the fuck drugs those were. i would visit my parents a few times a year later, figuring i was fine. nothing happened. no scary rumors or anything that someone was out to get me. in a way, i am glad it happened? i would end up becoming a life long new yorker and would find a great career and my wife here. i thought i was only gonna be there for a few weeks, maybe a few months. nope, i would spend my life there basically.

"i beat up a 5th grader in highschool.. i was playing basketball at the park with my friend when said 5th grader started talking shit to me. after a while of just shooting the ball, more kids showed up, and even some parents, yet this kid was still calling me a ""n*****"" and ""f****t"" and was being really irritating-mind you he is a white 5th grader. we started some 3vs3 games and we were chilling. the 5th grader started calling me band-aid(i had cut my finger earlier by accident) so i was trying to start being rude back by calling him ""fatass"" (he was overweight). after i beat him he started talking more shit to me and kicked my knee really hard. i was in a lot of pain. he grabbed my leg and pulled me down to the ground. i rolled over so i was on top, i thought i had control of the situation and told the kid to step off or i would hurt him. he proceeded to say ""fuck you band-aid"" and punched me in the eye. this set me off and, well, let's say we won't be seeing that kid any time soon. i punched him in the nose twice and he punched me back. i ended up breaking his nose and hit him hard enough to the point where i fractured his jaw.

i honestly can't remember how the idea came about, but somehow or another a bunch of us got the idea of showing up to school early and going into our classrooms (which were almost always unlocked) and getting the answer keys to our final exams. we went to a fairly large high school so all of the exams were standardized so the answers worked for almost everyone's tests. i think there were two or three of us who were the ones who took the initiative to get all the answers. i remember sneaking into my music appreciation and my algebra classrooms to steal the exams. people also stole the exams for spanish and chemistry.

fast forward and the answers are being passed around to a ton of kids in all sorts of different classrooms. kids were sharing answer cheat sheets left and right. everyone had typed in the scantron answers into their ti-83 calculators for their algebra exams, had them written on small pieces of paper for chemistry and spanish, etc. i remember looking around my spanish class and thinking this was getting out of hand in the study hour before the exam as almost everyone had the answers or was getting the answers. this was supposed to be for only our friends but it started getting out to everyone. at this point i was getting worried something bad was going to happen and was thinking i needed to look through my binder/locker after class to make sure i didn't have any answer keys floating around anywhere.

&#x200b;

then the shit began to fly. one of our assistant principals storms into my spanish class (looking for me it turns out) and walks right into a girl sitting next to the door copying down the answers on a small piece of paper. she grabs the girl and takes her to the office. the student never returned to take her test and ended up getting a zero for cheating and failed the class. 

&#x200b;

right as i was finishing my exam (purposely missing more answers than i was planning on at the beginning because i knew something was up) the assistant principal comes back in and asks me to come with her to the office.  when i get to the office all 4 principals and the school security officer are waiting for me in a conference room. they say that they've been told i helped steal all the exams and are going to search me. i'm freaking the fuck out at this point as i'm almost positive i've still got the algebra exam key in my binder somewhere. lucky for me, my binder was an absolute disaster. every page from every single class i took was just shoved randomly into this binder/the bottom of my backpack with no organization or anything whatsoever. organization and tidiness weren't my strong suites at that point in my life. they start to tear through my bag and binder throwing pages all over this conference table, saying that when they find what they're looking for i'm going to fail all my classes. i'm so scared i can't barely speak. they're asking questions and i can barely get words out to answer. then they get to the bottom of my backpack and binder somehow without finding anything. pissed the fuck off, they tell me i can leave as at this point the school day is over. i then get my confidence back in spades and throw an absolute fucking fit saying this is fucking ridiculous and they need to clean my shit up off the table and put it back in my binder and backpack. destroying my property for no reason, that they were searching me for no reason and this is bullshit yada yada. one of the assistant principals starts to shove all the papers back into my bag with the most smug look on her face.

&#x200b;

when i finally get all my shit shoved into my bag and leave my friends have been blowing my phone up. they thought i was for sure fucked and was going to fail my classes. i call/text everyone with a big sigh of relief saying i got away with it and they didn't find anything. this is when i find out that the way they had found out i helped steal the exams was that they caught another kid with an exam key who ratted me out. this poor kid was a 4.0 gpa student, in all the honors classes, on multiple sports teams, and in plenty of clubs/activities at the school. he was given a zero on all of his exams, failed his classes, and his parents transferred him schools the next year. i never heard a word about the kid again. while i, the stoner skateboard kid, got away scotch free. i feel so bad he got caught because he was a good kid, but at the same time fuck him for ratting me out!

&#x200b;

tl;dr - helped steal almost all the final exams sophomore year of high school and passed them around the school. one kid who was a 4.0 gpa, extremely smart kid, got caught with an exam key and was given a zero on all his exams and transferred schools the next year never to be heard from again. i got searched by all the principals in a conference room but they didn't find shit because my life was a clutterful disaster and i got away with it!",11
"i broke up with my boyfriend because he didn't believe in evolution. i try not to be closed minded, i really do, but he told me that i was wrong because ""god made everything in literally six days, evolution doesn't fit.""

so i broke it off quickly and without a lot of regret.

edit: i honestly wish i could have overlooked it, because i sacrificed what was otherwise a fine relationship for something that a loooot of people said was pretty trivial. i don't regret it because i couldn't have been okay with it, but i wish i could have? i don't know.",11

"i abandoned my family to take my own life. i was born into a family of religous extremists, throughout my childhood i witnessed and was subject to all kinds of child abuse. one of my earliest memories is being pinned down by two of my older brothers and molested by my sister. 

i was convinced that ""god"" could read my thoughts and was sharing them with my parents. it was like living in 1984. i was manipulated into policing my own thoughts. if i had a thought that violated my parents beliefs i immeidiatly purged it from my mind fearing hellfire or worse my parents.

my parents brought me up believing that a gay man is not a man at all, and i believed it, they got me to reject my own sexuality and hate myself for something beyond my control.

for more than two decades i was maliciously bullied by my family. my parents tried and succeeded to stifle my emotional, mental and sexual development. what was important to them was my fathers career as a clergyman. anything that did not fit his narrow world view warranted a violent outburst. 

my family crippled my ability to engage or even feel safe around people. for many years i couldn't even speak to a person unless they spoke to me first. i am an extrovert but i isolated myself as best i could to try and feel safe.

i was extremely depressed, suicidal, miserable and hopeless. i don't know whether no one noticed or no one cared. at 12 years old i decided i would distance myself and then end my life.

i was and am still afraid of my family, they put me through hell. they were violent and morally corrupt to the core. even today i am terrified of facing them. 

 after i had graduated high school i new it was almost time. i found myself a job i could sustain myself on, and once i'd moved into my new home i cut them off completely.

they attempted to make contact with me through various methods but i refused to allow it. 

its been three years since then.

a lot has changed about me

today i don't want to end my life.

today i am an atheist.

today my mental health does not stop me from enjoying life.

today i am self reliant.

today i can start a conversation with a stranger.

today i am not afraid to continue living.

today i can be openly gay.

today i am happy.

today i am wholly and unabashedly myself.

edit: thank you all for your overwhelming support. it means so much to me that my story is giving hope. this is a difficult topic for me to talk about with my friends and colleagues, it has been weighing on me lately and your support is so uplifting.",11
"i bailed on my friends to hang out with mom no regrets. i made plans with my friends to go see black panther on monday. i hung out with them all weekend though, and i realized i never really hang out with mom much. i just moved home after not living here for 8 years and i hang out with my friends more than my family.

so i randomly told my friends that my mom wanted to hang out and i missed the movie to go have dinner and drink wine. 
my mom was so happy. she thanked me left and right for spending time with her. 

spend some quality time with your parents while they're still around, guys. it means the world to them.",11
"i stole my 8 year old step brother's nintendo switch. last year my dad bought a nintendo switch for his girlfriends kid, and mario kart with it. he played it once and never again, it stayed in the same spot collecting dust for a year. since the new pokemon games are coming out in a few weeks and i don't have the money for a console i just took his. its been a few days and he hasn't even noticed. i'm pretty sure he forgot he had one in the first place",11
"remorse i told my wife i wanted to have sex with her mom.. remorse 

first off it wasn't out of nowhere, i don't even plan on it and it's just a fantasy. so my wife and i are both 34, her mom is only 56 and we've been married for 10 years. her mom is smoking imo, i think it's just cause her and my wife look so much alike. they both have nice dark eyebrows dark hair brown hair, not the biggest breasts but nice asses. 

we were lying post sex yesterday, and she asked me some of my biggest fantasies. i told her a threesum, she laughed and reminded me that will probably never happen. then she asked me who i would want to join, and i didn't want to tell her but i just was straight up. i told that her mom would probably be my first choice. 

her response : yeah very funny asshole, now who? i told her i was serious, that i always found her mom very attractive. i reminded my wife that i think she's the most beautiful woman in the world (i do) and that her mom is the closest looking resemblance to her. it kinda sounded romantic in my head, but i knew i fucked up. 

it happened last night and she's been passive agressive, making snide remarks. asking me if she would wear her hair a certain way cause her mom wears it like that, or if she should do her makeup like this etc. she's pissed, i do feel bad but i was honest and don't take back my words.",11
"i've been raped 3x and my views on rape are kinda fucked up. remorse

i've been raped 3 times. 

the first time i was drunk and went to  bed alone (in a hostel, dorm style but empty except for me) and woke up in the middle of the night to the brother of the guy i'd lost my virginity to the previous day having sex with me.

the second time was aggressive - there was no actual violence but i was held down and definitely physically forced, against vocal protests.

the third time i believe i was drugged - i had two drinks and the next thing i knew i woke up in a hotel with a pounding headache next to a guy i'd never seen before who was probably 25 years older than me. he insisted we hadn't had sex but there was a condom in the trash can and, well, as a girl you can usually pretty much feel if you had sex very recently.

none of these experiences affected me really at all. i'm not traumatized in the least. 

i think that's why i have fucked up views about rape. i know logically that rape is awful, but it just doesn't really set off my ""oh my god what a horrific thing to have happen"" bells. with some exceptions, i guess. i can see how a straight man might be very traumatized to be forced into sex with another guy. i can see how it would be awful to get violently raped and injured, but even in that case it's more the violence than the unwanted sex that makes me go ""oh fuck no."" 

i don't get it, and i wish i did because i am aware that i am pretty much objectively wrong about this. i would definitely, a gazillion times over, get raped than murdered. hell, i'd rather get raped than have my arm broken. 

i would never express this in real life because as i said, i'm aware that i am wrong and abnormal, and there are many people who are legitimately deeply traumatized by their experiences of rape.

what's wrong with me? downvote away.",11
"i got tattoos from 15-19 and my parents still don't know. i'm 22m.

when i was 15 i wanted tattoos so bad. i absolutely loved them. i wanted sleeves and a chest tattoo blah blah blah. 

so, my parents didn't let me. i worked a parttime job and saved most of my money. i remember i saved a little over a thousand. 

my uncles friend owned a tattoo parlor and i decided to ask my uncle if i can get one and he said he'll ask his friend. his friend gave me my first tattoo. didn't have consent by an adult since i was under 18, and they only charged me half.

i did this for four years. i have my entire back, chest, shoulders, and quads/ass covered in tattoos. i think i'm done now. i don't want anymore. i don't want sleeves either anymore because i work a corporate job after college.

however, my parents still don't know. i've avoided going to the beach with them and when i do, i don't take my shirt off. they have no other excuse to see me without a shirt so i'm in the clear 99% of the time. but beach time is when it usually gets tricky.

so that's my confession. sorry mom and dad.

edit: for all of those asking, yes, i regret it. it's not smart for a 15 year old to put a tattoo of a large shark on his back. not at all.

edit 2: for those asking. my left shoulder has a huge tribal tattoo that travels from my deltoid all the way down to my side. my right shoulder has a long quote with a huge landscape that also travels down my side. the center of my back has a huge shark coming out of the water ready to bite you. all of the connect and pretty much completes my back and shoulders. my chest tattoo is angel wings because i was 16 and cringe. my thighs have various things, they're all small tattoos that all have different meanings. as i got older i cared less, and now i have a spongebob tattoo on my right thigh of him flipping a crabby patty. i wanted to complete it by getting sleeves but the idea of it just turned me off of the whole thing. so i do not plan on getting anymore tatttos ever. so yeah. it's a lot. like, a lot a lot.",11
"i left my wife because i thought she was cheating, she became a heroin addict. i found out she never cheated.. disclaimer: i have always been an emotional, stupid, dumbass wrecking ball of a person. i wish i could say this was out of the norm. i've been in therapy since i was 11 years old. 

i met my wife in 2005 in a nightclub in lower manhattan, and she was an amazing person and we connected right away. we dated, then got married in 2007. i was 23, she was 25, but we were in love and to us it didn't really matter. we actually had a good marriage, and i loved her, and she loved me. i was shocked at how much we got along, for so many years, meanwhile most people in relationships started to hate me after like 3 months. she still adored me after 7 years. but leave it up to me to screw that up completely. 

in 2014, i had suspicions she was cheating on me. not strong suspicions, but she had a coworker who she was friends with who was... well, really attractive. i just thought, why be friends with this guy? she didn't often make friends with her coworkers, why this guy specifically? because he was hot? she was secretive about him, which made me way more suspicious. i remember one day she told me that she had a secret about him which she would eventually tell me. i probably should have listened and understood what she said more, the hints she were dropping seem really obvious in retrospect. i didn't get any of her hints. 

for a bit, she got defensive over her phone. that was when i sort of began really suspecting things. one day i checked her phone and all i saw was him texting her saying he really needs to speak to her, right now. like a bunch of texts. also texts about sort of inappropriate sex stuff. but it was really the ""i need to see you now"" texts which threw me off. 

i didn't even confront her. that's the worst part. i just left, and went to new mexico to go stay with my parents. i was *so sure* she cheated on me, nothing could convince me otherwise. i was so hurt  that i became suicidal for a tiny bit, then i went to therapy and got better. but i blocked her in every possible way i could. she had no idea why i left. my therapist kept telling me to contact her, i never listened. i actually lied to my therapist and said i did. there were some times where she called my parents and i talked to her and just said that i knew she was cheating, and that i couldn't be with her and that was that and then i just hung up. it was too horrible and emotional and i just wanted to put it all behind me somehow. i wanted to act as if it never happened. i didn't have the balls to deal with it. i didnt filed divorce papers at that time. i never explained anything further than that, i just hung up. 

in 2015, i painfully reconnected with her. i never told her why i left. i felt horrible, but i also felt angry at her for cheating. i never wanted to know who she cheated on me with, or what the situation was, i just wanted her out of my life. but when i finally connected with her, i just found an entirely new person. she was in and out of rehab, she was a pill addict. she said it started after i had left her, that she had a lot of pills left over from a surgery she had (she had a knee surgery in 2013) and started taking them a lot to  deal with the pain of me leaving her. then she connected with her friend who started selling pills to her. 

anyways, after a bit more of talking with her online over quite a few weeks, i eventually told her the situation as to why i thought she cheated. it was sort of this unspoken thing beforehand, i told her i didn't want her to bring it up. then i just asked her, straight up. and she told me, that was her coworker, and he was gay. she hung out with him a lot, and he would often call her and text her to 'come over' so they could talk about his problems. i checked his facebook, he came out officially as gay in 2014, before that he was in the closet. also, the 'inappropriate' sex stuff they were talking about suddenly made so much fucking sense. they were comparing the way women and men have sex to the way men have sex with men. but it didn't seem obvious by the texts i read, it just... kind of sounded like they were planning to do anal with each other. in retrospect it seems painfully obvious, but at the time it wasn't. i just wish i didn't fucking freak out and leave. i think if i even mentioned his name, it would have clicked for her, and she would have told me it was just a misunderstanding. but she had zero idea why i suspected her of cheating. 

 i left my wife, never spoke to her again, and went halfway across the country over a misspoken series of texts that i read because i was a sneaky fucking bastard and was too emotional to even ask my wife what the problem was. i just left. i never asked her to clarify anything. 

she would go on to become a heroin addict from a pill addict. she posts sometimes about how she is '3 weeks sober!' but its never longer than that. i am basically an alcoholic and live near my parents in albuquerque. i have zero interest in finding a girlfriend, instead i just have a bunch of meaningless one night stands when i go out on weekends. i am almost always hammered and coked or adderalled up when i go out on weekends. i sort of have friends, but not really, they're just a bunch of alcoholics and party people in the area who i link up with on weekends. i cant be away from my parents now, they're the only people i enjoy being around. i am just an emotionally fragile mess who feels like they completely ruined someones life over something so fucking stupid. i know it sounds stupid but for the past few years my parents are the only friends i have and the only people i really see besides the people at my job and the women i sleep with, who i never make connections with. i cannot help but think i will literally never get over this. the fact that i ruined her life over this. i go to therapy, and it helps but not enough.

i still sometimes talk to her. we officially got divorced, nothing split, in 2017. she is a heroin addict and i am horribly depressed so we have some relations, but i cant help but think that i ruined her life far, far more than i ruined mine. and the worst part is? the only reason i am in pain is because i ruined her life.

i binge watched all of bojack horseman and connected with his character, a lot. i feel like he inspired me to make this post.
