&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is an issue that has been chronically inadequate for moderators of large subreddits reaching out to the admins over the years. reddit is a great site with an even more amazing community, however it is frustrating to volunteer time to run a large subreddit and have questions go unacknowledged by the people running the site.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have not gone private because our team has chosen to keep the subreddit open for our readers, but instead stating our disapproval of how events have been handled currently as well as the past.",9

one statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and i'm glad it is taking place.

another point brought up was education and degrees. in this question, i don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

i realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. one just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. it also begs the question: what is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

an educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education. however, in case there is a trend of a growing educational gap, what concerns me is the possible emergence of an **educational divide**. depending on the definition of ""educational divide"" and high-quality data available, such divide might potentially be underway.",9

"gravitational wave megathread. hi everyone! we are *very* excited about the upcoming press release (10:30 est / 15:30 utc) from the ligo(http://www.ligo.org) collaboration, a ground-based experiment to detect gravitational waves. this thread will be edited as updates become available. we'll have a number of panelists in and out (who will also be listening in), so please ask questions!

faq:

> where do they come from?

the source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. ligo observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> how fast do they go?

gravitational waves travel at the speed of light (wiki(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speed_of_gravity)).

> haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

the 1993 nobel prize in physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, psr b1913+16(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psr_b1913%2b16).

in 2014, the bicep2(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bicep_and_keck_array#bicep2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. a joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the planck and bicep2 team in january 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the milky way.

> does this mean we can control gravity?

no. more precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. it takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. for more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see here(http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> what's the practical application?

here(http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> how is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? is this gravitons?

here(https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (see limits on gravitons below!)

first of all, i'm gonna limit what i put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like egyptian, mayan, greek and latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken english and ipa usage. really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* latin, greek and mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the rosetta stone. when greeks invaded egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. many egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (this i found super interesting) names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this greek language infusion. this means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* in the example of tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (tut, ankh, and amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. the appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: as an example, ""tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""tawat 'ankhu qaman"" (taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn).

* finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. this part seems kind of confusing and i might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. see u/ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point.

also a man is depicted looking directly into the exposed nuclear core, i presume in full meltdown, right after the explosion, immediately his face turns orange reddish and after a couple of seconds he's seriously sick and vomiting blood, is this accurate?

"askscience ama series: we are scientists here to discuss our breakthrough results from the event horizon telescope. aua!. we have captured the first image of a black hole. ask us anything!

the event horizon telescope (eht) — a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was designed to capture images of a black hole. today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, eht researchers have revealed that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.

the image reveals the black hole at the centre of messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby virgo galaxy cluster. this black hole resides 55 million light-years from earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the sun

- press conference right now! eso.org/live(https://www.eso.org/live/).
- details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/eht
- press release: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1907/

we are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result. we will be available starting with 20:00 cest (14:00 edt, 18:00 utc). ask us anything!

"how are we able to perform a body transplant when we can't repair spinal injuries?. so as many of you have probably heard, the first attempted ""head transplant"" is scheduled to occur later this year. i haven't been able to find scientific articles on the subject but it seems they plan to fully connect the nerves/veins/etc, and the spine. however to my knowledge we still haven't figured out how to repair a typical spinal injury, so how can we, even if just in theory, expect to fuse two different spines to any extent?

edit: so this blew up quite a bit. for the record, i am well aware we can't fix do a body transplant yet, i simply wanted to know how we could even attempt it when we hadn't overcome a major hurdle like that though.

i am well aware the odds of success are super low, that's now what i'm asking about.

"if iron loses its magnetism at around 1400°f, how is the earths core magnetic?. after reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system i saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).

im not sure why i never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, i regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

also i know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

so i did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which i have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), i dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  i also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

then i started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

so i researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

edit:  thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  i really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

the major points i have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  we are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

"prosthetics: can someone born without a limb (rather than losing it after birth) use advanced prosthetics controlled by nerves and neural pathways?. i understand (or at least, i think i do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect/genetic condition.  at no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... if he are she is born this way i presume that there is no neural pathways/nerves to dock onto.  i am sure that technology will continue to advance so i guess i am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.

the inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  he utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  a very heart warming video.  many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  but one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.

any thoughts?

&#x200b;

**edit:** thanks so much for the response everybody!  this is my very first post to reddit after years of lurking... first, let me say that i was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much i understood about this subject at a base level.  to clarify the question, i believe what i was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. that seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  i will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. while i am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:

can someone born without a limb as opposed to losing a limb later in life use myoelectric prosthetics? why or why not?",9

"if the universe is an hypertorus, is it possible that we receive the light from a star twice ?. i recently read an article in a french science magazine stating that the universe might be an hypertorus (euclidian, finite and borderless). they represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.

i made a drawing to make my question clearer : drawing(http://imgur.com/a/c84eq)

 *the three panels on the left represent the universe in 2d and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. the star is any star and the black dot represents the earth. the arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *the three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the earth.*

 * the first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * on the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. what we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * on the third line i was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. we would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?


**to recap**

it sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?

i was thinking about something recently. if we have a universe of 2d space that us as three-dimensional beings can look at, we can interact with that universe but only in a distorted kind of sense. a 3d object casts a 2d shadow. a 3d object moving through the plane of a 2d universe would appear to a 2d being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.

we haven't found a 2d plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as i know, we haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional ""shadow."" at least, as far as i know.

> u/yellowstone10: some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a moon rock collected by the crew of apollo 14 was probably ejected from the earth about 4 billion years ago. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon(https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
>  
>u/foramsgalorams: in january of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from earth within it! this would make it an earth meteorite which struck the moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. this would have happened like a game of solar system pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the moon. radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in earth's 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the theia-earth impact event which formed the moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. you can read more on the details here(https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in earth and planetary science letters here(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0012821x19300202). 

**3. moldavite – rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

> u/aa_unfiltered: moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. it formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite(https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. hydrogen and helium** 

>u/slowerthanlightspeed: ""jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atmospheric\_escape#jeans\_escape(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atmospheric_escape#jeans_escape)   
>  
>atmospheric escape of hydrogen on earth is due to jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\10\ the earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\10\ but a japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the earth.\11\ 

**also volcanoes apparently do not have enough force to eject matter into space** 

>u/clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction(http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
>
>u/knowanuknow : it's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. the most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. i thought krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of tnt. but even that isn't enough. it literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 hiroshimas (or 4 tsar bombs) and even that isn't enough. there's something called a verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verneshot(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verneshot)

the iconic ""dive-bomber diving"" sound we all know is actually the sound of a wwii german ju87 stuka dive bomber(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junkers_ju_87). it was the sound of a siren placed on the plane's gear legs and was meant to instil fear and hopefully make the enemy scatter instead of shooting back.

when a person gets really old,cancer cells would form in a certain part of his body since his dna becomes ""weaker""as he got older ,but let's say just in this case that the cancer cells can not move to other parts of his body(metastasis )to make the situation similar to plants where cancer cells are locked in this position since they have cell walls that surround the cells. cancer cells would still originate from different parts of his body as he gets older until tumor covers all of  him and he dies.

"why can't i weigh the earth by putting a scale upside-down?. please read this before answering

this is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. gravity pulls two objects with mass together. the force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. the force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

but newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. it seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

so is force really mass x acceleration? where is this discontinuity coming from?

"askscience ama series: i'm matthias hebrok, and my lab has just published a breakthrough in making insulin-producing cells in a dish. my team at ucsf hopes to one day cure type 1 diabetes with transplantable beta cells made from human stem cells. ama!. i'm a stem cell biologist and director of the ucsf diabetes center. my lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. we just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7unbjg

my lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (t1d), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. currently the only cure for t1d is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.

one of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. they sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. we can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. 

by producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as crispr to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.


i'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. i'll be starting at 9am pst (12 et, 16 ut). ama!

"is it possible to 'store' light so it can be used as a form of energy?. year 12 student here. i recently learnt about superconductors and how they can essentially keep current running in a loop forever without losing energy. random idea just popped into my mind - since we've developed fibre optics - a way of transmitting data by sending light patterns with energy loss close to 0 - why can't we use principles such as tir (total internal reflection) to collect large amounts of light (sunlight) and then store it similar to how the superconductor bank works? 

if we could be able to store light as a form of energy - could be collected, amplified by using mirrors and be a source of sustainable energy much alike solar panels (quite inefficient).

* it's not a major issue for putting out the initial fire. water can still be used. a spray of individual droplets doesn't provide a conductive path.

* it *is* a concern for cutting people out of a crashed vehicle. responders must be careful not to cut through energised high voltage wiring. but non-electric cars also have hazards to cutting such as airbags.

"how did a population of landlocked seals manage to establish itself in lake baikal, of all places, at an altitude of 450 m and several hundred kilometers from the nearest coastline???. i'm familiar with other landlocked seal populations, such as those in lac des loups marins in northern quebec, but those are right next to the coast and roughly at sea-level too .... easily explained by isostatic rebound. 

but baikal???

the baikal critters are perched way up at almost half a km altitude and almost 1500 km from the closest coast (the okhotsk sea).

i don't get it...

and if it happened in baikal, why not in other large freshwater lakes such as lake superior, great bear lake ~~or even lake ladoga~~?

"what is the velocity of the edge of a bubble as it is ""popping""?. take a bubble - soap/water, milk or otherwise - and initiate a ""pop"" from a single point on the surface. what would be the velocity of the bursting edge, as it propagates away from the initiation point?

here is a video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blne2ae5a2c) of some bursting bubbles in slow-motion. notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.

for simplicity, assume a *perfect bubble*:

- perfectly spherical
- evenly distributed surface
- no external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)
- ""pop"" or burst initiated from a single point on the surface

it seems intuitive that the *upper limit* would be the **speed of sound** for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping. but i'm unsure what role the pressure differential(https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/127695/why-is-the-pressure-inside-a-soap-bubble-higher-than-outside) might play - if any at all.",9

"if numbers can be infinitely large, can they also be infinitely small?. a friend told me the following math problem:  


imagine you are walking to the bus stop. your current position has a value of 1, the bus stop has a value of 0, and the distance between the two can be represented by a decimal. before you reach the bus stop you must first reach half way to the bus stop (0.5), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.25), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.125) and so on and so on, i think you get the picture. if you must first pass an infinite number of places before reaching the bus stop, mathematically how do you actually reach it?

if you continue this process infinitely, simple math would suggest that you will never reach the bus stop, but we know that we can reach it in a real world example. is this because as numbers get very small they must approach a finite value? ",9

"does each percent of your phone battery last the same amount of time or does it drain faster as it approaches 0%?. this may be a dumb question because the word ""percent"" would imply equal parts unless it refers a portion of the battery that is charged, meaning that some portions could last longer than others, if that makes sense. 

it may all just be confirmation bias, but i always feel that my phone battery drains insanely quickly during that last 15-20% while it doesn't drain as quickly off a fresh charge. 

lastly, i've always heard that battery technology was moving at a snail's pace yet lately i've been hearing about phones charging to 50% in 20 mins. i'm assuming that the remaining 50% takes longer than 20 mins to charge, which is another reason i feel like each ""percent"" on my battery could last different amounts of time.",9

i keep telling him even if the metal mostly decomposed, we should still have some sort of evidence of really old scrap metal or something right?

"why my phones touchscreen sometimes registers a touch when in reality my finger is millemeter or two from screen?. my guess is static electricity since it only happens once in a while and randomly but i am hoping for more insightful explanation.

edit:
it also usually happens in the middle of typing. it never happened, for me, on first letters i typed. and, i am sure my finger did not touch the screen in a way i just did not feel it. when it happened i was surely away from screen, that is why it always jumps out when it happens. it is always unexpected.

edit2:
i can surely replicate phone registering very soft touches (without me feeling actually touching it) but those random ones i am experiencing are different, the finger is always a lot further away than when i can register a touch without feeling it by testing. a lot may be very relative term but that is how it feels to me, i am not really sure how far the finger actually is because it usually happens really fast and its hard to measure so small distances with feelings. so, there is a small chance that i am imagining it.

if you were in a decompression chamber and gradually decompressed (to avoid the bends), could you walk out onto the martian surface with just an oxygen tank, provided that the surface was experiencing those balmy summer temperatures mentioned in the comment?

"happy pi day! come celebrate with us. 
it's 3/14/15, the pi day of the century! grab a slice of your favorite pi day dessert and celebrate with us. 

**our experts are here to answer your questions, and this year we have a treat that's *almost* sweeter than pi: we've teamed up with some experts from /r/askhistorians to bring you the history of pi.** we'd like to extend a special thank you to these users for their contributions here today!

here's some reading from /u/jooseman to get us started:

> the symbol π was not known to have been introduced to represent the number until 1706, when welsh mathematician william jones (a man who was also close friends with sir isaac newton and sir edmund halley) used it in his work *synopsis palmariorum matheseos* (or a *new introduction to the mathematics*.) there are several possible reasons that the symbol was chosen. the favourite theory is because it was the initial of the ancient greek word for periphery (the circumference).

> before this time the symbol π has also been used in various other mathematical concepts, including different concepts in geometry, where william oughtred (1574-1660) used it to represent the periphery itself, meaning it would vary with the diameter instead of representing a constant like it does today (oughtred also introduced a lot of other notation). in ancient greece it represented the number 80.

> the story of its introduction does not end there though. it did not start to see widespread usage until leonhard euler began using it, and through his prominence and widespread correspondence with other european mathematicians, it's use quickly spread. euler originally used the symbol p, but switched beginning with his 1736 work *mechanica* and finally it was his use of it in the widely read *introductio* in 1748 that really helped it spread.

"if i flip a coin 1,000,000 times, what are the odds of it beings heads and tails 500,000 times?. so i was playing around on excel, and i copied the formula =randbetween(1,2) into 1,000,000 cells. i then summed the total number of 1's and total number of 2's and found the difference.

i refreshed the formulae and the 2nd time the difference was 0, meaning there were exactly 500,000 1s and 500,000 2s. i then carried on refreshing the formula and the difference didn't come out at 0 for quite a while, but was always between -2,500 and +2,500.

this got me thinking - is there a probability of this difference being exactly 0? how would it be possible to work it out, and is there a name for this kind of probability?",9
