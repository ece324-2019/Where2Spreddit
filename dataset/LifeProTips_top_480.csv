"x percent of y is equal to y percent of x. so, if you want to find out what 7% of 50 is, you could instead find out what 50% of 7 is, which is 3.5. this means that 7% of 50 is also equal to 3.5.. more examples: if you want to find out what 2% of 20 is, do 20% of 2 instead and you'll get 0.4. so, 2% of 20 also equals 0.4.

edit: this post got more traction than i was expecting. i'd really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where i am. i grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. from elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

they've had dramatic changes over the years. in high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). a decade later, i can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. it's become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. many middle/high school kids have lan parties. smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). my library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

even though i prefer pin-drop silence, i have no issues with these changes. **it's better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. and putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!",8

i guess i can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what's worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. most american employers/career help centers i've met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won't go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

a few people have mentioned latex. i use latex often in my math coursework, but i'm not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. pages (on mac) has been sufficient for me.

as far as linkedin go, it's a less-detailed version of the master document i keep, as far as work experience goes, but i go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on linkedin than i do on paper.

"college isn't the only way to start a good career. apprenticeships, trade schools, and military training can be great alternatives in today's world.. the price of four-year universities in the us, among other countries, is huge and growing. there are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

if, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**to high school juniors and seniors:** 

your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. if you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. here(https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

these jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. as that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. according to this article(http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. anecdotally, i work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**is there any money in it?**

there definitely can be. unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. i'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until _ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt later. 

that's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. there are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. you're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**what are my options?**

there are a ton of ways to start a career, but i'll talk about a few.

**apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

a recent report(https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from npr took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in germany's industrial success. the us government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. the federal program is here(https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest american job center(https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

the federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. in a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. one example would be the ibew(http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so i won't bother trying to list a bunch. searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**trade schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. there are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. job corps(https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. it isn't for everyone as i understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but i know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. a computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**military** training can also be a great economic ladder. the pay and benefits are good from the start. depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. there are some huge risks associated with this route though, so i would reserve it as a last resort. 

regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. that is not the only income, though. in most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. that's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. on the outside, that would cost a lot.

regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. you could also be a bus driver. you don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. i would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. i really enjoyed most of the time i spent in the military. there were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. the good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. the bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

i know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. in reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**tl;dr**

if you want to get smart, go to college. if you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**edit:** based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. as a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the af lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""no thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

also about the military, i offered it up as a last resort, and i mean that. plenty of commentators are saying ""don't ever think about joining the military for training!"" i don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. you would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. if you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

regarding rotc, it is better than nothing. i intentionally didn't mention it though. my philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing rotc vs my immediate family and i enlisting. if you do rotc, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. after 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. if you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the af, can't say how easy it is in the others. so you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. from a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. additionally, i had a way better time than any officer i know, and i didn't even like the military. the lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. i wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

still relevant to rotc, but about school in general... a ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. i'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful lpt. you have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",8

"high schoolers, dont think you have to go to college to be successful. not great at school?, look at learning a trade. you can make a good, sustainable income as an electrician, plumber, welder, etc. you can enroll in a technical college, or better yet find a apprenticeship at a larger company. wow didnt think this would blow up over night, thanks for all the advice anyone.

"if ever you need a program you want for free (for example a video/photo editor) don't search for ""free"", search for ""open source"" to avoid limited trial versions, adverts and malware. the reasoning being if you type ""free"", generally you will be advertised to or get the lite version which will only have some of the functionality and then will be up-sold to.

open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. 

this has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.

edit: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't mean that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.

i am assuming you will be excising a modest amount of caution with what you download by checking it against trusted reviewers/communities.

an example of what i'm talking about here is that i used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  at first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  the answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether i do it or not. now i don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

"if you get a kitten, do use your hands for play so you can teach restraint when they are too rough. restraint is naturally learned in play with hands and littermates because the fun stops when a bite or scratch is too much. adult cats who didn't play this way are more likely to scratch or bite.. obviously this only works if you shout loudly (""oww!"") and stop playing if a bite or scratch is too hard.

i've only been scratched or bitten by cats that weren't properly socialized in this way. cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. for example, i have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and i can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. but once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.

similarly, there was i time i had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. this goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to.",8

edit - wow, lots of comments - both positive and negative. for some extra help / elucidation:

-	i found this very helpful when i was starting my career. the biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out ""on paper"" to better see where things need to change, where i didn't know all i could know, and where others may struggle in the future.
-	i am indeed now a director. our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. it's those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; i can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. as a manager, it's a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. i'm never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it's because they've found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.
-	most importantly, where i'm from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they've been forced to ""work themselves out of a job"" then they can sue for constructive dismissal. i know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it's not a common motif. as such, i do agree that if you're in a country like india, china, usa, where some of these protections and freedoms aren't so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. in others, like germany, uk, most of scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.

but yes, as with anything - this has been an experience i've personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation. i guess as a second tip - if you're working for a company where you feel the management are always trying to find ways to screw you over, maybe it's time to find a new company to work for...",8

edit: since this has blown up beyond anything i could have expected, i feel the need to address a couple of things. there are about 1000 of you screaming ""just make it from scratch!"" and y'all are missing the point. whether you love it or hate it, box cake mix is a thing, and they're extremely popular. millions of people use them all the time. they use them because they're easy, inexpensive, and accessible. there are 8 billion people on this planet and not everyone knows how to bake. not everyone wants to learn, or can even afford to. and that's ok. but for a lot of people, box cake mix is a great jumping off point. all i did was mention a couple of easy things to improve on that that people might not know *because maybe no one had told them before now.* some of y'all are getting awful snobby about cheap cake and it's not a good look. 

second, a bunch of people have suggested other things to jazz up cake mix, from instant pudding and applesauce to coffee and even soda. and you know what? that's fantastic! if you have something that makes baking easier or makes a cake that you think is delicious, then do it! you bake that cake! baking should be enjoyable, and if it's delicious then why does it matter how you get there? everyone has to start somewhere so play around with it, experiment, learn what you like, and what works for you. have fun with it. it's just cake.",8

"lpt tips: what you should never to bring to a dry cleaners. i owned a dry cleaners for 5 years, and before that, used to work in one for 10 years, both front and back end. i know the whole process. i'm going to spill the secrets on garments you should never bring to a dry cleaners because you are being ripped off.

edit: disclaimer: my experience in the business may not be necessarily reflective of all dry cleaners so take that into consideration.

down jackets -  down items are expensive. it could cost $40 to have a down coat cleaned. down items have to be washed by themselves, lest they spill feathers onto other items, so that's why they're so expensive, to ensure profit from the isolated load. down coats are rarely dry-cleaned, but laundered, and then hung to dry overnight, and then placed in a dryer for a few minutes to plump out the feathers, and good to go. down items are not pressed. you could wash a down jacket yourself, hang it to dry, and get the same processing

comforters - never bring a comforter to a dry cleaner unless it specifically says ""dry-clean only.""  dry cleaner owners won't dry clean a comforter unless they have to, because it's cheaper to launder. comforters can range from $39.99 or higher and you're getting less quality than you would at a laundromat. comforters are rarely ever spotted for stains, and they're laundered in a basic commercial wash machine with a standard setting, hung to dry over night to save on drying time, then placed in the commercial dryer, and then finished. if your comforter had any bad odor before you brought it in, it probably is still going to have that odor. you're better off paying $5 at a laundromat, and choosing your own cycle and spin settings.

spot-clean only dresses - many customers don't check or understand their care labels, and dry cleaners love that. some formal dresses are ""spot-clean only"", which means, it can't be washed in the conventional way.  it might fancy sequins glued to the fabric, which dry cleaning will melt and damage the dress. dry cleaning is oil-based and will melt glue and plastic. dry cleaners may charge you up to $30-50 due to the fanciness of the dress, when they can't even clean it. they may go over the spots and individually spot and treat them, or, at best, hand wash the item by soaking it in cold water, and hang drying overnight, nothing you can't do at home. again, with the fancy sequins, the item typically can't be pressed.

wedding dresses - wedding dressed could cost up to $200 even though they are dry cleaned the same way as a $6 pair of pants, but, if you bring a wedding dress, never opt for the preservation box. dresses are more if you get the preservation box, which adds $50 or more to the cost - but dry cleaners do not press wedding dresses that get placed in the box, which is typically there for an indefinite period. by the time the customers opens it 3 years later to notice it isn't pressed, it's too late to take back to the cleaners for a redo.  so you're paying more money for the dress without the pressing. you get more for your money if you buy the preservation box elsewhere, and put it in there yourself after you get your dress cleaned and pressed.

leather: leather is the most expensive item to clean, around $50 for a coat, but dry cleaners rarely ever do leather on premises, but send it out to a third party leather cleaner. so you're paying more than what the dry cleaner pays to have it cleaned. also, there is no special leather dry cleaning method. leather is simply lightly spot cleaned with a dish-soap leather formula and then hung to air dry in a moisture-free environment overnight. you're essentially just paying for the labor charge. to save money, you could lightly go over the jacket yourself with dawn soap, water, and a microfiber towel.

&#x200b;

worth it:

men's button-up shirts - men's shirts only cost around $1.25-$2 a shirt, they're laundered by the bulk and then heat-pressed on their own machine in less than 20 seconds. dry cleaners don't make their money off of this, so it's a great value to the customer.

wool peacoats - wool peacoat are notorious for getting lint on them, and they're dry-clean only. counter employees will often remove the lint by scraping and shaving the fabric so it looks much nicer at pick-up.

d/c only items - suits, silk shirts, cashmere sweaters, etc.

oil/grease spill - dry cleaning is oil-based and will absorb oils on fabric such as food, yellow body perspiration, motor oil, that water can't get. if you get oil on your fabric, it's worth it to request dry cleaning at a dry cleaners. it's especially great for removing the yellow body oil stains around the armpit and collar areas.

also want to add the benefit of opting for""press only.""  baseball/hockey jerseys cannot be dry-cleaned as it will melt the logos. they are laundered. however they do look nice when pressed. so you could save money by washing items like jerseys and polo golf shirts yourself and then bringing them in for ""press only"" if its the pressing you like - and save a few euros off the price.

bottom-line: to get the most of your money, if you drop something off at the dry cleaners, make sure it can benefit from the professional-grade pressing.  if your item cannot be pressed, you are often paying more for an item you could be doing yourself.",8

"got a friend or family in the hospital? consider giving them cozy blankets, soft socks, open toe slippers, book/ereader reader, long phone charger, and condiments for food instead of flowers.. note: *this is a repost to my previous submission that was removed for an undescriptive title.*

i was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. this made me realize what i would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- hospital hvacs systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. i was told they could only bump it up or down here at my va hospital. also, this was the first time i received an iv treatment and let me tell you they are cold... had an iv in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and i am pretty convinced i could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**warm, comfortable socks**- reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *credit*: /u/getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so i followed up and asked my nurse about this.  turns out, the va hospital does have socks available and my new rn was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


**condiments** - i believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. this problem might be compounded by medication. may have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **edit** i recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  generally, it would be wiser to consult with the rn or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**open toe slippers**- luckily i had flip flops on when i was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if i only had tennis shoes. probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**long, braided phone charger** - my wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. i can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. i recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. also, i am using a 5ft usb hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**entertainment**: a book, ereader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   the tv service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. if they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. the gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *edit* /u/stjerndale recommended audiobooks.  great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**gift cards**: *credit: /u/1900grs, /u/halftimeheaters.*  gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*bonus lpt*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  they take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  this bonus lpt is intended for *adult patients.*


edit 1

**power bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  this was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.


edit 2

**eye mask & ear plugs** - /u/ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/suedeveil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.

**moisturizers & chapstick** - /u/jessicasanj, /u/fatjennie, /u/bluephoto recommended these items.  i will have to admit that my hands were getting pretty dry from constant washing.",8

use a boat whenever possible while crossing flooded urban areas and use extreme caution when walking.

people often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. however the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.

it is way easier to see with an image(http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). if you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.

so i started acting like it was my failure to explain the situation...even if it wasn't. it totally changed the tone of my voice and made the person i was talking to more receptive to my instructions. instead of turning into an argument or debate, it turns into a constructive teaching opportunity.

"lpts: chrome extensions i wish i knew of back when i started college.. as i am about to enter my grad school i have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. as a result, i recently started exploring chrome extensions, and man i wish i had done this earlier. some will no longer be of use to me but i hope it can help others. 

**cite this for me: web citer**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)
this one hurts me a bit as my days with mla, apa, harvard, and chicago are coming to an end. the extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. from my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as easybib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.

**google dictionary**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)
if you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). it's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. i imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. 

**grammarly for chrome**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)
i often use bad grammar and i know it. this extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. it highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. 

**readability**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)
this extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. i would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article i'd give this a shot. 

**speakit!**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-us)

i know i can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. this app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. or i guess you could take notes as you listen too...

it works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand german-english accents over the default one). you can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. i could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but i would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. 

**block & focus**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)

type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. there are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. 

**molview**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)

i haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in o-chem or higher. it allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. i was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what i'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.

**bonus tips that i learned**


***make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. it will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. 

***use sleepyti.me(http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** it's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. i cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as i stayed up too late studying.

"if you believe your employer may be discriminating against you when it comes to pay, do not be afraid to ask your coworkers what they make. it is a federally protected right to speak about salary.. in the usa, since 1935, there has been a federal law that prohibits any company in the private sector (and as of 2014, also the federal sector and federal contractors) from discriminating or terminating an employee for sharing their salary with others.

keep in mind, there are certain positions that are specifically excluded from this law:
- workers in religious schools (they must follow the school's rules)   
- agricultural laborers   
- airline employees   
- supervisors (who aren't classed as ""employees"" for this purpose)  
- independent contractors 

while it may not be specifically stated in the law, positions in human resources or financial positions may also be prohibited from speaking about pay in certain instances, since they often handle money. 

keep in mind, that while an employer can not stop you from talking about your salary in general, they are within their right to ask you not to do it on company time. 

also, keep in mind that while you are within your right to talk about salaries, you should be careful who you tell.

got one last year, was surprised at how cheap and effective it is.

our house is relatively new yet the downstairs gets frigid, my wife mentioned that the windows felt drafty yet they were solidly shut. we used this and found very slight cracks in the chaulking that were letting cold air in. after using it to find all the weak spots and rechaulking along with fixing some door insulation and closing a flue the house is much more comfortable.

bonus: you can aim it at pans/foods and tell temps within a few degrees (surface only of course).

double bonus: aim it at your so and say you found something hot.

"bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike. **tl;dr: short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**

short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.

the recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.

she survived, but she easily could have died. *on a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*

i myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. the only time i've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. i got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. it really can happen to just about anyone. i got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.

and now, with the popularity of parks exploding, i see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. if anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

so: never go unprepared. get a wide-mouth nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.

the things i have in mine include:

\- survival heating blanket

\- plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- whistle

\- flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- critical meds and bandages

\- zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- compass (if you're able to use it)

\- paracord

\- knife

\- duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (i always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing i can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - i've experienced this first-hand).

\- iodine tabs for water

\- beef jerky

\- energy gel

**edit:** because it may be of interest: i just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that i don't mention in the list. for reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.

**edit 2:** i wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. the kit i describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. 

the kit i mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.

for people wanting to see the kit i made, or skeptical it can be done - just google nalgene survival kit. lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than i have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. 

definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.

finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *this kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*",8

"don't judge your ""market value"" as a romantic partner during your teenage years/ early twenties. a lot of decisions during that time are hormone-driven.. adolescence lasts much longer than most people think, until around 25. before that, the human brain is not yet fully mature, meaning that psychological and behavioural patterns still undergo changes. thus, our ""true personality"" only manifests itself during the late twenties.

before that happens, people are often ""in lust"" rather than in love, but without realizing it. our bodies are wired to produce as much offspring as possible as soon as possible, because early humans used to die young. this can lead to our relationship decisions in high school and sometimes college being based on biological urges rather than compatibility of personalities.

so don't worry if you can't find a partner in high school or even college - the good times are still ahead of you!

bunnies are as much work as a cat, if not even more! (ok, it seems they are much more work than a cat)

they poop. a lot.

you need to clean their toilets. a lot.

you need at least 2 bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be spayed*)


bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.

bunnies are not for picking up! they are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!

they need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.

you need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)

"lpt request : do not request one hour dry cleaning if you can help it.. as a dry cleaner, i can tell you that it take an average of 1 1/2 hours for a proper dry cleaning cycle to complete: a double bath (rinse and cleaning with detergent) and a drying cycle. if a dry cleaner is offering an hour service, something was skipped. 
it take an average of 110 seconds to press a pair of pants, so take that into consideration too. that is if all the stains came out on the first try. most likely, they need to be spot treated on the spotting board by a professional spotter to remove some stubborn stains. and that may or may not need to be cleaned again with pre-spot spray treatments to get that last stain out.
usually, a dry cleaner who offers  an hour service have to shorten the washing cycle and skip pressing the clothes and just steam them while on a hanger to get them out on time. they have to also make time for tagging, bagging and racking and inputting the order into a computer or some system for pickups.
in summary, dry cleaning itself needs to be done in 45 minutes (2-3 min rinse and 35 mins for drying and the rest for extraction spinning and cool down) and the rest for processing if the staff is on top of things.
before, it was possible cause perc was a strong enough chemical to wash like water, but most dry cleaners have switched over to an alternative dry cleaning solvents away from perc by now, especially in california.

"genuinely caring about somebody a lot, does not guarantee they care about you equally (or at all) in return. some people will never care about you regardless of what you do or say. so don't assume somebody appreciates you just because you do nice things for them.. this is something that i unfortunately didn't learn until well into adulthood - it may sound obvious when its spelled out, but when you're in the actual situation its not always so clear.  most of my life i thought if i really cared about somebody a lot, then they must care about me to some degree in return. it always felt like that connection was so strong it had to be mutual, even if the obvious signs showed otherwise. despite certain people treating me like dirt and rarely reciprocating, i would do everything i could to make them happy. i would go out of my way to help them, say & do nice things for them, encourage them, etc..with the assumption they'd eventually show their appreciation for me being in their lives.  i'd think ""how could they not care about me when i make it so obvious how much i care about them? if i just keep trying they'll come around"".  this was especially true for people who maybe showed signs they cared at some point in the past, but weren't anymore.

what i've learned over the years is that a lot of times that reciprocal connection is imagined. the amount you love somebody does not always affect how much they love you back. people can and will use you and your emotions. and just because somebody may have once cared about you in the past, doesn't mean they still do now or ever will again in the future...theres often nothing you can do to change their feelings through any good deeds or kind words. 

i'm not talking about classic ""nice guy"" syndrome. not the crush who friend-zoned you that you're desperately trying to win over by being nice when there should have never been any expectation of feelings to begin with...i'm talking about people who you genuinely feel a meaningful connection with. whether that be friends, family, or romantic partners.

i wasted a lot of time on people expecting them to suddenly start reciprocating my feelings and actions. i'd be convinced i could win people over (or back over)...including bad friends and former relationships...if i was just nice enough to them and let my feelings be known. looking back i should have cut my loses far sooner. i should have focused more on finding people who not only cared about me, but wanted to make me happy in return.

its important not to assume somebody appreciates you just because you love them and do good things for them.you can waste a lot of time and energy focusing on people who will never really care no matter what you do.

**edit** i should note, i don't mean to say you should only do good things for people if you expect something in return. there is nothing wrong with being nice to people just because it makes you happy (even if they don't appreciate it). but you can't expect them to some day change their minds. and you shouldn't let your desire to please people who don't care about you distract you from finding people who do.",8

"your hearing is not invincible. please lower your volume when listening to music. bring earplugs to concerts. do not make the same mistake i made.. your hair cells are fragile. protect them. i made the mistake of listening to music and pretty much anything at unsafe levels. now, i pay the price of having an endless phantom ringing noise in my ear, also known as tinnitus.

this will get lost, but, at the very least, some people will see this and correct this mistake i made. 

here is a link to relative noise volumes(https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/training/ppetrain/dblevels.htm). also, when you're outside in a bustling city or on a subway, you might decide to turn up your volume to high and unsafe levels so that your music overpowers the noise around you; don't do this. 

for those who don't know what tinnitus(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiajjogj0cs) is. there are many forms of tinnitus. this(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059qomgla_o) is but one of them. 

edit: i'm glad this is reaching many people. if you have friends or family members, please inform them as well. i often think about why many of us are never taught about the importance of protecting our ears. if you can hear someone's music through their earbuds, then it is most likely far too loud. if you google ""tinnitus definition"" and you expand the definition box, you will see that it's been on the rise lately. 

""the u.s. centers for disease control estimates that nearly 15% of the general public — over 50 million americans — experience some form of tinnitus. roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, while 2 million have extreme and debilitating cases.(https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts)"" 

stay safe everyone. 

edit 2: hello everyone, i've been seeing a lot of post here. thanks for sharing for anecdotes and informing others of how your tinnitus came to be. just a few things to keep in mind. not all tinnitus is caused by hearing loss or loud  noise. tinnitus can occur if you're sick, or if you have an ear infection, **earwax buildup**  or even through medication, or in rare cases if you have tmj. in these cases they may or may not be permanent (i don't want to scare you), and i would highly recommend going to your ent (ear, nose, and throat doctor) as soon as possible. also remember that just because there isn't a cure for tinnitus does not mean there may be professional treatment out there that can significantly improve your quality of life. this is important to remember. see your ent to get these ruled out! 

as /u/ohcleo mentioned, don't clean your ears by putting cotton sticks in your ear canal. this is how you cause earwax blockage. 

edit3: i've been reading all of your comments. here i will include some notable suggestions i've read but may be lost in the pool of comments we have. 1) also wear earplugs while motorcycling, drumming, if you're a musician, . 

2) ***don't wear earplugs all the time, only when necessary***; wearing earplugs for too long can also damage your ears. 

3) **there are earplugs called ~~""etymotic""~~(just search for ""earplugs that don't muffle sound"") earplugs or musician earplugs that actually keep the sounds the same, and in some cases even help sounds sound better but at a lower volume** 4) listening to music for too long even at medium volume can still cause damage, take breaks. 

/u/ukralibre said ""thats interesting but its almost impossible to convince people to use protection before they get harmed."" however, by then it'll be too late. take all these anecdotes from your fellow redditors and heed this lpt. 

edit 4: i put more emphasis on not wearing earplugs all the time only when necessary because that's important. it can lead to hyperacusis. you want to protect your ears from loud noises, not every noise. 

edit 5: for many of us tinnitus redditors, if you already have it, it's not as bad as it sounds. have you ever smelled something that smelled awful initially but after a while you don't even notice it anymore? or that car smell that you recognize when you first enter a car but after a while inside the car it just ""disappears"". same with your tinnitus, only it'll take a little bit longer than that.

our brains are amazing and have crazy adaptive capabilities, also known as brain plasticity(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vadlld97clm). your brain will begin to ignore the phantom ringing, but the ringing itself will not subside. i know how ludicrous this sound, but i have i personally have habituated to the sound myself, and i'm pretty much back to my normal life. things like stress and caffeine can cause a spike in your t. for now, use background noise like rain drops, or white noise, perhaps a 10 hour video of a busy cafe (on safe volumes, of course). as always, seek medical or professional help nonetheless.

"after college, once you get the first job, start looking for a better job after a year or two. don't stay out of loyalty.. because trust me, no company is loyal to their employees. be respectful and professional, but loyalty in a company is rarely noticed and appreciated - unless maybe if its your dad's company.


as a person who has worked for a same company for 6 years after graduating, i found out i didn't get a single raise within it unless i ask for it every fucking year, never got much other benefit than initially signed while studying at school.


so i started applying for 5 months and finally got a job, it pays me almost 5 (edit: 4 is more accurate+ benefits such as health care, lunch, gym etc...) times as much as i used to. my friend from same school, with same seniority was getting 4 times my salary for the last 2 years already.


my mistake was thinking that being loyal to this company was gonna in return make the company loyal to me, the company only wants lower costs, loyalty has no place here.

"the fibonacci sequence can help you quickly convert between miles and kilometers. the fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where every new number is the sum of the two previous ones in the series.

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.  
the next number would be 13 + 21 = 34.

here's the thing: 5 mi = 8 km. 8 mi = 13 km. 13 mi = 21 km, and so on.

edit: you can also do this with multiples of these numbers (e.g. 5\*10 = 8\*10, 50 mi = 80 km). if you've got an odd number that doesn't fit in the sequence, you can also just round to the nearest fibonacci number and compensate for this in the answer. e.g. 70 mi ≈ 80 mi. 80 mi = 130 km. subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding, and the end result is 115 km.

this works because the fibonacci sequence increases following the golden ratio (1:1.618). the ratio between miles and km is 1:1.609, or very, very close to the golden ratio. hence, the fibonacci sequence provides very good approximations when converting between km and miles.",8

"a real, effective apology has three parts: (1) acknowledge how your action affected the person; (2) say you're sorry; (3) describe what you're going to do to make it right or make sure it doesn't happen again. don't excuse or explain.. most people treat an apology as a way to explain their point of view. but that feels to the listener like making excuses or minimizing their experience. 

say your roommate accidentally ruins your  couch by spilling a big cup of coffee on it. think about which you'd rather hear. 

mediocre apology: 
""i'm so sorry! i just got startled when my phone buzzed and i accidentally knocked it over. it was totally an accident. i feel terrible.""

good apology:
""i know you really like the look of that couch, and now it's got a stain on it - you must be really bummed about that. i'm so sorry. i'd be happy to pay for a cleaning, and in the future, i'll keep my drinks in the kitchen. 

edit: reading through the comments, i think i should clarify. i'm talking about situations where you feel bad about something you did or said, and want to clear the air with an apology. this is not applicable to situations where you feel you did nothing wrong, or don't want to apologize.

"never take a problem to your boss until you have multiple solutions to it.. it may seem obvious to some but imagine the difference between an employee coming to you with a problem that you then have to figure out how to solve vs an employee coming to you with a problem they already have several solutions for and you simply need to choose (as the manager) which option you believe is best. 

in my experience when most employees come across a problem they don't know how to instantly solve they simply present it to their manager and wait for a response. 

this does nothing other than concrete your managers opinion that you are unable to do their job and they subconsciously disqualify you from promotion, presenting them with multiple solutions to a problem however makes them feel they are in control whilst simultaneously considering you as an asset worthy of promotion or at the very least retention.

edit: couple of things that have come up

1. time frame - i wasn't suggesting withholding critical information from your superior, if you have 30 seconds to tell them, come up with some ideas in that 30 seconds, even if they are bad ideas it shows you are willing to employ critical thinking in important situations. you can teach someone with bad ideas how to improve them, you can't teach someone with no ideas how to have them.

2. trivial matters - obviously don't bother your boss with trivial decisions that are a normal part of your job, it should be clear based on the roles and responsibilities of your position which decisions need management oversight and which are well within your jurisdiction to make, if that distinction is unclear it is certainly something you should clarify with your manager.

3. you should just make the decision yourself - in many situations this is correct from a pure ""efficiency"" standpoint but often if you don't take things to a manager your solving them goes unnoticed and your clever decision making is superfluous, it is a fine line between irritating and impressing your manager and that line can vary wildly depending on the individual but generally speaking when combined with common sense it works.

4. management perspective - i am not currently a manager, over the past 20 years i have bounced back and forth between employer/employee in different companies, combined roughly 8 years as a manager and 12 years as an employee, i am not complaining about my current situation, i am very happy and follow this lpt on a daily basis.

edit 2: thankyou all so much, i really didn't expect this and the different perspectives presented in this thread are mind blowing, the other lpt i follow is ""seek first to understand"" and you have all helped me (and hopefully others) to do just that.

"when resigning from a company, don't tell a single person until your management has acknowled and accepted it.. as a manager who faces employee resignations, in many ways it can open a door to conversation. it's not always about money. maybe it's an opportunity in another department, maybe it's a change in responsibility and yes, sometimes it's a pay change.

however, the moment you go running to your coworkers proudly telling them you've just given your notice, that opportunity is gone. management generally doesn't need the appearance of weakness and counter offers are precisely that. if half the company knows and you ended up staying with the company, everyone knows what happened and it fosters bad behavior.

also, accepting a counter offer is not the end of the world as many would have you believe. it's entirely situational and sometimes you have to play the game.



edit: wow. compensation is always a touchy subject. a few things to understand before you continue to assume that i am the world's worst manager.  

1. someone posted a good summary of how the annual review/raise process works.  we get a bucket of money to spread across a team as we see fit.  it's usually a small bucket.  i also never have the power to walk into hr and say ""hey, give this guy a 20% raise, he's earned it. oh, and why not do the same for the rest of my team while you're at it?""  in fact, i have very little control and even a counter is just leverage for any manager to get traction on the subject.  

2. seems that the consensus is that every single person in the workforce outside of the fabled ""top performer"" is underpaid.  i can assure you that that isn't the case.  many times people have that impression and they are actually perfectly within their pay bands.  go ahead, tear me apart for this, it's just the truth...

3. remember employment is a mutual agreement.  everything is in play.  if you don't like what you do or what you get paid, talk with your feet.  there is nothing wrong with that.  ",8

"when you see someone being harassed in public, act like you know them and get them out of the situation.. i took a course on civic courage (?) last week and we were taught to not approach the perpetrators when we see a dangerous situation in public -- that would not help the victim, and would just lead to us getting punched in the face too. instead, we're supposed to reach out to the victim, address them by name and ask them to come with us. this gets them out of the situation without needlessly endangering you.

example (we watched a video on this): two drunk guys enter a subway car and start bullying a skinny young guy reading a book (taking the book away, not letting him get up). another passenger goes over (but doesn't get too close) and says, ""hey, peter, i haven't seen you in a while, why don't you sit with me? how's the girlfriend?""

"""nutritionists"",""nutritional therapists"", ""holistic nutritionist"", or ""nutritional coaches"" don't require any formal certification, education or training to use those titles. ""dieticians"" do require it. be careful who you accept diet & nutrition advice from.. **edit** 
important note to this. only registered dietitians or rdns (registered dietician nutritionists) are technically certified to diagnose & treat food/nutrition related illnesses, diseases, & conditions such as eating disorders & deficiencies. 

1) some or most people might spell it dietitian, not dietician. unsure if one is correct or if its just regional.


2) ymmv. certain countries or states likely have different regulations on this. afaik in  most parts of the us and uk, nutritionists *can* get some sort of certification and higher ed training, but its not generally required, and its not as regulated as a dietitian or registered dietitian.  in almost all cases, anything like ""diet coach"" or ""nutrition coach"" or ""heath coach"" or ""nutritional specialist"" are bs terms. main takeaway from this lpt is do your research on your own country or state's rules, and be careful who you trust.


3) i'm not intending to imply that there aren't any nutritionists with 4 year degrees, graduate degrees, or proper training. just saying rigorous education & certification is not always required, unlike dietitian, which is a regulated & protected term almost universally. i'm sure there are some great, knowledgeable nutritionists and nutritional therapists out there...and some terrible quack dietitians. again, do your research and be careful who you trust.

"when arguing, try restating the main point's of the other person's argument back to them and have them do the same with you. believe it or not, the vast majority of arguments are based on miscommunication.  

with arguments, there are often several things occurring simultaneously that result in conflict.

1) not understand the other person's argument

2)  feeling that the other person does not understand your argument

3) convoluting and intertwining non-related issues into the argument

4)  arguing about two different things all the while thinking you are both arguing about the same thing...

5) an unwavering belief that you are right and the other person is wrong and thus you don't need to listen to their argument

...

next time you are arguing with someone pause the argument and restate their argument back to them.  

something like, ""hold on, i want to make sure i understand what you are arguing. you are saying that xyz is broken and the only way to fix xyz is to get qrs to modify y so that it will fit better into z?""

now this has several benefits.  

--first and foremost it helps to identify exactly what the fuck the argument is even about.  this is huge because most arguments get so convoluted the people arguing don't even know what they are arguing about (and this goes double for emotional and relationship type arguments when the people have history together).  

--secondly,   this technique demonstrates you are making an attempt to understand them and this will have a calming effect

--thirdly, it forces you out of the frame of mind that you are automatically right and enables you to actually ""listen"" and ""hear"" what they are saying.

--fourth, it helps you step outside the argument, see both sides, be more objective and able to see more solutions.

you can also do the reverse.  pause the argument and ask ""can you tell me what my argument is?  can you explain the problem as i see it?

this forces them to pause and process what you are saying and it helps to break the momentum and out-of-control death spiral arguments tend to descend into.    and again, it helps to actually help define the exact problem...",8

"daily use of the art of upod (under-promising, over-delivering) will help your life. tell your s.o. that you will be home at 6pm and you are home at 6:30pm, doghouse. tell them you will be home at 7pm and arrive at 6:30, hero. 50% of successful relationships are about managing expectations.. under-promise, over-deliver (upod).  not new advice, i know, but there are some very specific caveats to be successful at this.    these are specifics that have helped me in my parenting of my 4 children, my successful career in the pursuit of an m.d. ph.d. in neuroscience/neurology, my marriage of almost 12 years, and even my self-confidence (yes, i under promise and over deliver in my personal expectations).  

1.) realize that under-promising and over-delivering **is not an attempt to be dishonest, it can actually be more honest**, giving you a buffer in case weird stuff comes up (traffic, health issues, the other obligation you hadn't originally factored in). people often tell if you are just lying to them to impress them. 

2.) upod only works in relationships in the long term if **the under-promise is still relatively close to what your gut estimate would have been in the first place**.  you shouldn't tell your so that you will be home at 10pm every evening, and show up at 6:30pm every day, as 6:30pm will be the new expectation regardless of what you say, and what you say will lose credibility.

3.)  **don't over-promise to try to initially impress someone**, it will hurt you in the end.  if you are like me, you want others to think highly of you, which might tempt you to ""offer"" to do something quicker or much better than you probably can't do (or only can do under ideal circumstances).  this is especially true for people in new jobs and new relationships.  although this might work out for you initially (you work crazy hours to meet a crazy deadline that you set for yourself to impress someone), it comes with some natural consequences that are nobody's fault but your own.  first of all, you have now set the bar very high for yourself, making it difficult to over upod with them again.  many will, going forward, expect you to maintain that expectation of you going forward.  second, even if you somehow manage to keep it up, you will eventually opud (over promise and under deliver), which can really hurt you in the end.  you might also come to resent the other person because of their expectations of you (even though in truth, you were the one that initially seeded those expectations in the first place).  

4.) when starting out, **buffer upod with ""i wish"" statements**.  i have 4 kids, and with my m.d. ph.d. training, i literally cannot make it to all of my children's extracurricular events.  at the beginning of each school year, i remind my kids that although i wish i could make it to every event, i will not be able to attend everything. every time i show up, my kids are totally stoked.  i sometimes wait until just a few hours before to let my kids know i can make it to an event (even though my wife has a much more advanced heads up) just to manage expectations.  although some might say that this makes it hard for my kids to feel that they can rely on me, or trust me, i have found quite the opposite.  i have an almost 100% success rate at being to the things that i say i will be at. 

5.) when employing upod, **focus conversations on what you know 100% that you can do.**  for instance, when a colleague is really trying to pressure you to attend a conference that you probably don't have time to attend, reply with ""i really wish i could go, but i probably can't.  could you do me a favor when you get back and do lunch with me to discuss the interesting tidbits you learned/shared at the conference?""   when a customer at your restaurant asks you to make a specialty order that you are not sure the chef can do, let them know ""i will check with the chef to see if i can do this for you, but it is unlikely that we can do this.  however, i can bring you some free extra breadsticks that i can see you have all enjoyed so much this evening.""   

6.)  **you can maintain an optimistic attitude while still upod-ing to yourself**.  i just realized that upod-ing yourself sounds really weird, but my point is that it helps to have realistic expectations of yourself, and to give yourself some buffer.  i used to always tell myself that i would get more work/homework done over christmas vacation.  turns out, i was always disappointed at how much i actually got done.  now, before the break, i tell myself i will be happy to get 10 or so hours' worth of work done each vacation period. if i get more done, i am pretty proud of myself.   for instance, even though i spent about an hour putting this post together, i am only really expecting it to be looked at by about 20 people, with only about 5 or 6 reading all the way to this point.  this is okay to me as if it helps even one or two people enjoy the success i have, it is worth it (also, i plan on sharing some of this directly with my close friends and family).   

7.) **under-expect in your own relationships with others**, and give people a break.  realize that thing come up, and that everyone is fighting a hard battle.  teach them, in gentle ways, how to upod. 

8.) **in some instances, it is okay to let them know that you are upod-ing**.  example, tell your friends that you would love to play games with them online this evening, but you are pretty sure that your boss is likely going to keep you after work (because he usually does on a friday evening).  i say ""some instances"" because excessive explanations might actually get them to distrust you, especially if the explanations are beyond their current level of comprehension.  for example, for some, when a mechanic or doctor starts using words that no one has ever heard of, people become suspicious or resentful of that person.  for instance, you don't need to explain why the pizza might be an extra 5 minutes later, just quote them 5-minutes later and wow them when you get there 10 minutes early.  

i apologize if this felt like a lecture, i just would have loved if a parent or mentor had shared these with me before i had to learn many of these caveats the hard way.    thanks for those of you that made it through all of this, i am excited to hear from you about what you have learned about the art of upod.

tl;dr:  under-promising and over-delivering has helped my life, and will help your life, but there is an art to it.

edit 3: for anyone wondering, the responses largely breakdown into a few categories:

1. don't answer the phone/just hang up.
2. i don't need security i have guns/dogs.
3. tell them to come so you can use your security/guns/dogs.
4. yes this actually happened to me/someone i know/this is useful.
5. this would never happen/is not useful.

it's that 4th category that makes it all worth it! i appreciate your stories. not trying to paranoid, just trying to help :)",8

"if you've had the same internet service plan for a while, take a look at what your isp's current advertised plans are. you may be ""grandfathered in"" on a slower, more expensive plan.. realized this the other day, and i wish i had figured it out years ago. my family has been on the same internet + phone + cable package from knology (now wow) for over a decade. after fees and taxes, my dad was paying $270/mo for the whole package, and though i don't know the cable/phone details, i do know we were only getting 20 mbps down/2 mbps up internet speed. that didn't seem right to me, so i went and took alook.

on their website, this isp does not seem to offer any plan that has 20 down/2 up internet speed. they do have a 10d/1u single-user service (standalone internet), but in their package deals, they only had 50, 100, 500, and 1000 internet speeds (no 20).

turns out, we've been paying for the same service *at the same rate* for the past 15+ years. so while high-speed internet was getting faster and the cost was going down, we were still paying what was considered a fair price for what was considered a high speed in the early 2000s.

one call to the isp, our plan was changed over the phone and a tech came out today and installed the new modem. we are now getting 1gbps ~~up~~ down, 50 mbps ~~down~~ up, have the same phone and cable service as before, and are paying $30 a month **less** than before.

edit: for like the 50th time, i typed down when i meant to type up, and up when i meant to type down. my speed is 1g down, 50m up, not the other way around.

also, as people have mentioned in the comments, **this doesn't apply to every isp** and in fact some isps will do the opposite: they will actually prohibit you from upgrading your plan if you're a longtime user, as their good deals are only for new customers. wow seems to be pretty decent as far as customer service goes, but i can't speak for any other isp.",8

"a goal towards a tidier home is not through periodic 'binge cleaning' but by keeping the house clean through small, everyday tasks.. to have a tidy, livable house that is always ready for unexpected visitors, you should focus on small tasks that keep your house clean everyday.

for example: if you pick up a book or a magazine up or play a board game, put it back after use.

if you use a blanket, fold it up after you get up. anything that is displaced when in use - even a pencil or a remote.

instead of piling dishes in the sink, try to wash your cup or plate immediately after you use it. this will leave the sink free and you will only need to wash the larger cooking dishes after you're done cooking. 
extra protip: if you have something on the kitchen counter, put it where it belongs (even in the sink) so that your counter is always clear. even if your sink is piled up with large dishes but you have clean counters, it's still a better look than a tidy sink surrounded by dirty counters.

what this leaves is a tidier, clutter free home which will only require mostly vaccuming, dusting, and/or mopping. when unexpected visitors arrive, you don't have to scramble.

i never have to do much in my room. my closet is a bit tougher to maintain but the rest of the things are always tidy and in their place. i have siblings who keep their rooms messy and then they binge clean later. it works for them but i don't think thats an efficient method.

of course its harder when there are more people in the house, but if you encourage as many people as you can then the clutter will reduce.

edit: massive response, thanks! the point is to do small tasks everyday so that it 1) doesn't buildup 2) helps you maintain a habit of cleanliness where you naturally clean something the moment you see it 3) makes your home's default setting as 'clean' :) 

also, if your house is massively cluttered, then it's a good idea to do a binge clean first and then maintain it by doing small chores everyday. it's said that if you do something for long enough, say 40 days, it becomes a habit. 
edit 2: when you rely on binge cleaning, your mindset is that you don't want to do it now because you can do it later. this makes you less likely to clean as you go. whats the point when you can do it later? so the best way is to binge clean once and maintain it by cleaning after yourself.
also i missed a word in the title, sorry!

"if you want to make sure someone has learned the correct process, make them deliberately do everything as wrong as possible. speaking as a teacher (and anyone in an educational or supervisory role will likely relate), one of the most frustrating things is when you explain a task to someone and check that they understand, only for them to completely botch it. in fairness, we often do make assumptions that because *we* can do it well, others will have the intuition to also have the same skill and knowledge. it's difficult for a learner to recognise and validate their own process as being correct. however, people are very good at recognising when something is wrong.

the way this concept was introduced to me was to play two games of tic-tac-toe. the first game: play as normal and see who wins. you normally see some cockiness as people try to outplay each other and reach the inevitable draw. there's no real thought process of how to win, just making sure the other person doesn't.

second game: the goal was to *intentionally lose*. suddenly, the room fell quiet. each player had to think about doing the *wrong* move in order to lose. there was much more reflection and processing than playing to win.

this was then explained in the context of doing powerpoint presentations. we have an idea of what a good presentation should look like (clear bullet points, minimal text, minimal distractions, etc.), but we never seem to get students to understand what we expect. turn the expectations around: as a pre-task, get them to make the *worst possible presentation*, and you suddenly get a bunch of people engaged in outdoing each other in throwing in walls of text, spinny animations and multiple soundtracks. when the students made their proper presentations, they avoided all the things that they had deliberately done wrong.

whether you're teaching someone else, or teaching yourself, it may be helpful to do it wrong.

**obligatory clarification edits:**

1. this is intended to be a one-off exercise to **check** understanding. don't deliberately teach people the wrong method to do this.
2. the key is that the learner is **intentionally** making the wrong move, not accidentally or unknowingly. they must be aware that it is wrong.
3. don't do this in a real, practical situation. this is a learning and training tip.",8

"when reading a company's glassdoor pay attention to the date of the review. if you notice a lot of good reviews in a short time frame then that means that hr sent out a bulletin for employees to write reviews for the company.. my company's hr recently sent out a memo to all employees and left up many flyers to tell us to review our company on glassdoor. this is allowed by glassdoor and a tactic they advocate for companies wishing to combat their negative reviews or low rating. though the memo/flyer say to leave ""honest"" reviews theres an implication that they want us to leave good/positive reviews.

when i had initially started working for my company the rating was in the low 3's and the reviews were pretty sporadic in terms of the date. after the memo i saw a huge amount of positive reviews in a short time frame and their rating went up to 4.6. this overshadowed the negative reviews which i found to be accurate.

"increase your offers to help a friend who is mourning about 6 weeks after the death of their loved one. this is the point at which the initial wave of support has died off and people are particularly vulnerable.. a wise leader of a church taught me this.  he had helped many through the grieving process. when a close friend of mine lost a loved one tragically, i asked him what i should do to help them.  he taught me that often, the hardest time for people while grieving was when the initial wave of condolences had gone away and people don't really know/forget to offer help anymore.  meanwhile, the person grieving has to start trying to transition back to ""normal life"" and routines and they are often left more lonely than ever. **(note , i have noticed that this jump in time to support can be much sooner that six weeks, sometimes it is a soon as a few day).
