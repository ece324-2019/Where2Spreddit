"[Super Awesome Update] Sat down on my friend's MacBook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.","I never thought this would turn out the way it did and I really felt like I learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

I went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.

I did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it's around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I'm withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she's going to take me to court.

I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we'll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I'd give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

If it weren't for you guys I would've paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

I feel good for following all the advice here.

"(Update) Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/

I'm sad about this update for the kid, I took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because I had questions about an issue I'm having and briefly explained it.

Officer shows up, I invite him in and explain the whole situation. He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

We watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.

About 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.

The officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

After they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

I talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

I haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). I should have called them earlier once the CPS reports I was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything.",legaladvice
I think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. He is a doctor.,"This is in north Texas. 

Hey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. 

I think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. 

I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. 

I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. 

I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. 

I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. 

The next day he came over to ""Check on me"" and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. 

I am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  

Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police.

Neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive,"Male, late 20's, CO

I quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (I haven't consumed alcohol in years) and I replaced that habit with drinking Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Juice. The juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to Corona beer bottles. 
Here lies my issue:
This morning I was walking to my car from my apartment and I had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. My neighbors basically jumped me from behind. One grabbed my daughter's car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. He was saying stuff like ""The nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby."" As a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone's screen is destroyed, and I think my nose is fractured. Most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that I was not about drink and drive, but that I WAS DRINKING APPLE JUICE. This all just happened. I'm calling the cops. Any suggestions?

BTW, I didn't get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. They said they were doing their ""duty"" to protect the community.

UPDATE:

The police showed up. As soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. 

UPDATE #2:

Both men were arrested and I will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. I will be talking to detectives. The police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. ",legaladvice
"[UPDATE] [PA] I followed and reported a drunk driver, then I got a ticket for driving past curfew","This is an update to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

I took the advice that I was given and I pled not guilty. Last week I went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200B;

I brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the [""justification"" law](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

The hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

Then it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)

Finally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.

The judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. Judge agreed; I was found not guilty!",legaladvice
"I told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.","I got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. I didn't tell him all the details, but I told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and I showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because I told him I'd run away and call the police if he did.

He called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

We went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I'm pretty sure we're illegal. She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. 

There were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something. 

I should of done this year's ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place I'm in now is way cleaner than I'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. They also weren't very happy with our house I could tell.

I hope we don't have to go back. And I hope it's ok to post this. Even tho I don't need advice anymore. Thank you to everyone who helped me.",legaladvice

Thanks to everyone's terrific advice, I got my university's ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to RAINN) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

Within a day of meeting with the school's general counsel, my attorney and I were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

One of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration's decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching I am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

Between my professors' incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting I was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (I'll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

The ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward.

"UPDATE: My father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). My step sisters father, won't allow me visitations... I GOT CUSTODY!!!","**EDIT: per the bots request, I am required to tell you that I live in Washington (WA)**

[Here's my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

So after one of the most stressful months of my life, I can happily tell you all that I got custody of my step sister.

I did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people I've ever met in my life. I told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

After my step sisters bio dad was informed that I would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. The lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. She said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

After her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, I then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. I've never signed so many things in my entire life. Because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, I was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

Her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

Yesterday, I signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that I had 100% custody of my step sister. After I signed, we both cried and cried for hours. We're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. As I write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

The past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. I consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision I've ever made. These events have made me realise that family isn't just DNA based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

Thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. I owe all of you for the rest of your lives. Once I turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the Aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

I hope you all lead wonderful lives. Give your loved ones a big hug for me.",legaladvice
My wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! I'm growing very worried,"Posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

Title says it all. We've been married for 3 years now. She's always been one for quirky, ""against-the-grain"" thinking and interests. However, it's not just harmless things like believing there's no gold in Ft.Knox, taking pictures of trash in ""aesthetic poses"", or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... No, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. But now there's this anti-vax bullshit. 

She got sucked into one of those anti-vax Facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she's worked at a fucking Wawa for 10 years. She messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on Facebook. 

I love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. Shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her Vitamin K shot, and the Hep-B vaccine. However, now She's refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

I know that in her mind, she's coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we've had a number of arguments already. All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

""Oh well if you look this graph you'll see that the numbers of cases for <X disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <Y vaccine>""

""I'm the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I'm right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc..."" 

I've tried explaining to her the basic idea of ""correlation doesn't equal causation."" By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with ""We aren't talking about ice cream and murder, we're talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They're completely different!""

I've tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn't as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with ""Those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and ""big-pharma""

She won't budge and hasn't budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I'm worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could've been easily avoided. 

I am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife's knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don't want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child.

Update to: Someone is threatening to release nude photos of me that were taken when I was underage and I'm terrified that I'll lose my job and be arrested for what is essentially child porn (Ohio),"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/

So as the title states, last year I was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when I was 14/15. I thought I would update now that it's come to a resolution.

I went to see a lawyer the day after I made that post. He drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that I had nothing to worry about. It was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. Then I got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

I panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. He was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

Long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn't really allowed to know about.

Anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus I'm getting married in a few months and I'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. So I thought I'd update here with the good news! I was afraid that I'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys I got up the courage to deal with the situation. I really appreciate the advice I got here! Thank you again so much. ",legaladvice
"I was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the DA finally got around to my case. I did nothing wrong.","Okay, so a few days ago I was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. I lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

I was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

So then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I'm about to owe.

When he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and I was released.

What can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I'll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.

EDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told ""good luck"". Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.",legaladvice

Subaru Service center gave my car to someone else,"FINAL UPDATE

So I dropped my Subaru WRX off to be serviced at a third party service center.  They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. 

<EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

EDIT:

Thank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  They if I didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but Im really not having that.  Not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

FINAL UPDATE:
Hey guys I just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  Little backstory, when I first bought the car in November the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  That is what I was getting fixed.  That being said, in the end I will be getting a new 2019 WRX, I am pressing charges against the SM for theft, I have filed official complaints with the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board and the Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Section, and I will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  For everyone DM'ing me and asking about what the location is, I am not at liberty now nor will I be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  It is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  Thanks again everyone!

So, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200B;

So, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.

&#x200B;

Sorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

So, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.

(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

My brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.

During the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

Suffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

So, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don't need pity. I'm doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.",legaladvice
My Daughter Disowned my Underage Grandson. What do I do?,"I posted in r/JustNoFamily and was told to post here for better advice on what to do in this situation. 


My sixteen-year-old grandson was kicked out by his mother because he came out of the closet. He travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. I found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first I'm hearing about it. 


I phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. She said some very nasty things. I honestly thought I raised her better than to act in such a manner. But my grandson doesn't want to go back home, I'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but I want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible.

[CO] My ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. She now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. I want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible.,"Me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. There were a variety of reasons for this that I wont get into here. One of them though was her anti-science beliefs. She's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. Well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200B;

We have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. Well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. My ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. And threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200B;

Around this time I also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200B;

Ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. She somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. I have been stressed out from the minute I got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. My daughter must have picked up on this and thought I was mad at her because when I was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200B;

Turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. She made my daughter lie about it. Instead she has been using ""Special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" What about the forms I got saying she was vaccinate? There fake. I called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. So my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200B;

I'm pissed to say the least. My daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. My ex doesn't know I know yet and I told my daughter not to tell her, I want her gone now. How do I approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. I have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. I also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones I have a forged. I'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but I would like to know going in what to do. Thank you.",legaladvice
Little sister (16) needs an abortion. Texas wants parental consent which we can't get. Can I take her to New Mexico? (UPDATE: it's done),"https://redd.it/6m79kf

So it is done. We called an abortion clinic in New Mexico and asked for advice. They were very helpful. Scheduled an appointment.

I told my parents that I'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in New Mexico for 2 days. They never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. So in the morning I picked her up and we drove to New Mexico. We took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. Had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. Spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. She spent the day and that night at my place. I called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so I'll bring her there tomorrow.

She was feeling fine by then. So nothing suspicious at all. She's very happy this worked out the way it did and I'm happy that she's happy. I told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. You can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

Thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. Once we knew I won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. ",legaladvice
[Update] [MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,"I'm updating [my last post](https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

I did what you all told me to do. I wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. I also called them. They said they will speak with the school.

I was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

I said loudly ""I think you owe me an apology.""

She said ""yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.""

I said ""Yes, and another apology for saying I don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

She said ""I'm sorry"" and left.

The principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

I said ""It wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

He apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

So things are sorted out now. But also, I'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them. And the counselor had given me horrible advice.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!",legaladvice
Update - My brother went missing 6 years ago. Police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? How do we get more information. Illinois.,"https://redd.it/74we5z

I talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. They found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. The officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

There days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed DNA samples to confirm. DNA confirmed it was him.

What happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). That was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. That's when they decided to... His friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). Recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

The officer says my brother didn't die in pain. It was multiple gunshots. You'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. We had a funeral for him. Now there's a place that I can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

I thank all of you who helped.

[UPDATE] Had a falling out with the girl I love and got served a cease and desist order. What can I legally do? [Michigan] (x-post on r/relationships),"Past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

Oh boy. I've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn't going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

For those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

First, I want to assure everyone that I didn't contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don't want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn't recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn't be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt's house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. 

After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn't stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn't actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because I wasn't ""like"" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn't one. But I am. I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. 

In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. I've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

Thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I'm sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.

**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.

**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn't expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. 
I wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn't reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. 

2. I didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I'm not sure why I did it, but I don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don't know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. I've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I'd rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don't think.

4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real ""friends"" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say ""oh I'm perfect now so I can do what I want,"" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

Please get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",legaladvice
Update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. I'm back after 6 months.,"You can read my old post here: [[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

The place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.

They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.

They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.

From there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.

When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.

I don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

That's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",legaladvice
Can I get a paternity test on myself?,"Hi, I'm 16 y/o and have good reason to think my mom and dad aren't my real parents. I had a much older sister who killed herself when I was 6. She was 26 when she died. All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. She got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. Well I started thinking about it. I am the spitting image of my sister but I don't look like my mom or dad.

My mom and step dad are really into ""new age"" science and beliefs. I've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. Recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird ""support group"". I say that in quotes because I have no fucking clue who they are.

I tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. According to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. I've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but I've been unable too. They cut of the internet, phone and TV Tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. I'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way I've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. Last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy.

I'm at a friends house because I was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after I told my parents I wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. Her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and I plan to stay here tonight if I can. My parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"".

I'm so lost right now it makes me sick. I do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and I need to know what the fuck I can do here. Can I just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. If my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.

Edit:

I talked to my mom and told her because I would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times I could see my friend I would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was ""trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view"". I got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. He did not agree and was told I didn't want to talk to him.

He says that he is already looking into emergency custody (I want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great.

I have contacted amazon and UPS about their trucks crossing my property, UPS has instructed their drivers to no longer use that route, haven't heard a thing back from amazon yet but i have stopped two of their trucks so far,both of which were ticketed by the sheriffs dept and the one needing a tow to get pulled off the berm it got stuck on.

thank you all of you for the suggestions, hopefully soon this will all be over and i can get on with my life.",legaladvice

"GF's dad filled out her mail-in ballot, forged her signature, and sent her a photo of the completed ballot with the caption 'If anybody asks, you voted.'","My girlfriend was furious. Not only is this obviously illegal, but it's a huge breach in trust for my girlfriend and it totally defeats the purpose of voting for her, her  brother, and everybody else that this happens to. To be clear, my girlfriend and her parents DO NOT share political views, and they know that. 

I just want to know what action can be taken to potentially block the ballot from being counted and/or what can be done to press her father to understand that this is a serious crime and a clear breakdown of the Democratic system.

Edit: This is in Arizona.

Edit 2: We found out that the ballot has not been mailed yet. We are having her father send us the parcel instead of having him ""throw it out"" and risk it being submitted. The reason the ballot did not come to us is because he signed her up for early voting and put his address as the place to mail it. We live in a different city. ",legaladvice
[Update] I take prescription medication for ADHD. Started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. Company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. Left old job for new one and now I'm unemployed.,"Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)

I am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

I met with an attorney for a consultation Thursday. After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don't want to sue anyone if I don't have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

Ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

I asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

Anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.

When I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they ""want nothing more than a person with my background on their team."" He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.

He told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn't necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

So now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

Edit: I'm going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I'm taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it's not as ""intense"" as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn't give me the ""crash"" that Adderall does when wearing off.

Ex-wife is suing me for child support. I don't even have a penis... (update),"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/585svt/exwife_is_suing_me_for_child_support_i_dont_even/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I have both good news and bad news.

The good news is that I won the battle with my ex. I put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. I had documents about me showing I don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (I don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before I married her. However paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. That ended the case. It took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but I won. I don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. Maybe she thought that I won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.

The bad news is that, I'm dying. As I mentioned in the comments of my original post, I was battling cancer at the time that I made the post. It was the fourth time in my life that I was dealing with cancer and even though I had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and I have very little chance of beating it again. I will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. I'm happy with the life I've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until I finally rest for good. 

Thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. It helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. You could see from my comments on the original post that I was almost ready to give up. ",legaladvice
"(AZ) Our neighbors dog was poisoned. Police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). Wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. I say absolutely not. How should we proceed?","I guess some background is in order here. Earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. We were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 Our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. The next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. They did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. The next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. This all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

So they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. We tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

So we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. We have yet to contact the lawyer. 

We had made the initial report to animal control last Thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" I was really taken aback and I think I asked ""I think so, do you need some?"" 

He then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. I literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. I explained that I actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and I really have no way of knowing which dog is which). He said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" I got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


The officer then asked if he could take everything. I said I wasn't comfortable with that but I would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. I did exactly this. I was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. Again I was taken completely aback and said that I'm not sure what he'd be looking for. He told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. It took me as second but I asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. I asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if I remember) ""not yet."" 
I asked him if I could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. I said I would really rather not but I would get back in touch with him. He gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

I just got home and told my wife. My wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. We have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but I feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

She thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. I say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. I'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

Thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. Police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. Wife thinks we should let them, I say absolutely not.

>Edit: hey guys I'm involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in DM but it would sure be easier if I could just answer them once. I'm sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, I really don't want to say where I am and my attorneys name. All the laws I found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

So thank you to everyone who responded. And I guess thank you to everyone in the DMs who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, I want to sleep in my own house. Just to allay the fears of the other nice DM's, I did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. Also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

I took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on Monday night. I also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. I called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

He was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the DA actually pursuing this were slim to none. He did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, I could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. He said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


So basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as I type this) but I just heard (Wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. Basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. In fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. The people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. They also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all I know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people I've ever encountered). The can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). So with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

So our complaint to animal control from last Thursday is still on the books. The lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. Our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. The criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

"Cops completely destroyed interior of my car looking for drugs, found nothing","I had purchased a used Cadillac a few months ago for a good price from a mechanic I knew. He said his son was driving it. When I first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of BHO oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. I threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. 
Flash forward to the other night and I was pulled over for an improper lane change. Officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when I was being pulled over. He asked to search the vehicle and which point I said no. Waited half an hour for the dog to show up. He alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  He checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. After his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. They cut into the leather seats. They also cut into my spare tire. Mind you, I have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. They cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. I'm obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. After this well over 2 hour ordeal, I was told I was free to go. When asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. Before I do that I would like to know if there's any better options and how I should pursue this. The seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there's so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what I probably would've payed for it. Not to mention they also ruined my spare. Thank you.

"Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","For the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

At first I just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. However after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

I've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

She will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. I've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. Before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

Numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. I don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

When she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when I'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. Before I started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. Now since I've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. Somehow this is my fault.

Now I'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred German Shepard, an English bulldog and a mix Sheppard/bulldog).

I just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. I have a pool and if she falls in when I'm not home she could very well drown. That's why I installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, I truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

I've called the local child and family services office (CPS) several times in the past two months to report it because I feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. I have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that I've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when I open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

I feel like I've done everything I can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. I just have no idea what to do now? I've debated calling the police when she enters but I don't know how that will escalate.",legaladvice

I watched the VHS tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. That's why he kept his savings in cash. He didn't even trust a safe deposit box. That's why they were kept in his walls. And it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. I found the other $20,000.

I went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. She talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

I scheduled an appointment with the bank. When I told them it's for a cash deposit they told me I don't need an appointment for that but I told them it's for a large deposit. They still said no appointment is necessary, but then I said it's a very large deposit. So they booked the appointment. Everything went smoothly at the bank. They made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. Money was in my account a few hours later.

I made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and I now have a larger emergency fund.

I posted this 2 weeks ago and a lot has happened. Something happened before I could go any further with the lawyer I spoke to.

The Monday following the incident I was asked to come speak with a VP of HR I'd never met and only knew by name, because they work directly for the company that bought ours out. When I walked in the conference room there were 4 people waiting for me, 2 of which I was told was part of legal. What I didn't realize, is my friend who I mentioned in the comments of the other post ended up saying something to another coworker because he was so horrified at the situation (even though I told him to keep it secret). This information ended up making it's way up the chain and was not taken well, to say the least. I was asked to explain exactly what happened, who I told, and asked a lot of questions. Everything I said seemed to make them very uncomfortable, especially when I told them I was in touch with a lawyer. They had me leave the room for nearly 40 minutes and then called me back in and let me know they were very concerned about this situation, and assured me it was an isolated power trip basically....  

This is the holy shit part. They say that due to my long tenure in my position, knowledge of how the team works, and my relationship with clients that they felt I would be a good fit for the position the jerk manager sat in, and if I wanted the position it was mine, as their way of saying sorry. They also made sure to mention the large salary increase and bonuses this would come with. I took a couple minutes to think about it, and took the offer. BTW I'm not stupid, I know they did this so I wouldn't take any legal action against them, but I love my job and don't blame them for the actions of a 20something on a power trip. I also know it came down to he said/she said, and would've been a hard case to prove.

There's going to be a company-wide training on gender and interpersonal relations, and I finally have an office with a door I can actually close! I'm in the field a lot less now, so I guess the jerk got what he wanted, because now I don't interact face to face nearly as much as I used

[Update] [Iowa] City threatening a lawsuit to get me to take down a website criticizing town odors,"This is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jubfl/iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me_to_take/

Hello r/legaladvice,

A few months ago I posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town I live in sent a letter demanding that I take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. Most of the comments I received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my First Amendment rights, and yes, I should seek a lawyer. 

So I did so. I set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. However, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended I speak with someone ""outside the city's little sphere of influence"". 

Skipping over unnecessary details, I met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. I updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about "" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services"". 😉

Once I updated the website and the city realized I wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. I went, although now I realize I probably should not have done so. He was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought I should take down the website because it was hurting the town and ""we both want what's best"" for it. He also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think I should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. I declined the interview, because I was afraid I'd get sued (whether justified or not) if I said something the city didn't like.

Of course, I was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. So she ran her story, and I was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. What's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. They were also quoted as saying ""there may be legal stuff coming down the road"".

A few weeks later I received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. It was the attorney from the original letter writing ""on his own time"" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several Iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. He told me I was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. The letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.

This was around mid-January, 2018 (I received the first letter mid-December, 2017). Everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until I got an email from the legal director at the ACLU of Iowa. On the advice of Reddit, I had emailed both the ACLU and the EFF, but after over a month with no response I had figured they were too busy to look at my case. I was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.

I spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the ACLU of Iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. Toward the end of February we filed suit in Federal court, and by March 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:

1. They had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content I produce regarding the town.
2. They must pay legal damages to me.
3. They must pay attorney fees to the ACLU.
4. They must write an apology letter to me.
5. My favorite part, the city's staff *and its attorneys* must take First Amendment training.

All in all, I'm incredibly impressed with the ACLU's work on this case. I know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but I think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were.

[Update] My landlord shut off the electricity in the middle of a heat wave,"Original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cg42cd/my_landlord_shut_off_the_electricity_in_the/

This happened in NY.

I'd like to thank everyone who replied to that post. It was very helpful.

After the post my SO and I decided to get a hotel. When we came back this morning the power was back on. My neighbor told me what happened:

Shortly after we'd left, someone in the building called 911 because their son was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion (he's fine now btw). The firefighters were curious as to why the power was off. Long story short, after the kid was safe they had a nice talk with the landlord about endangering a child's life to save some money, and she was asked to turn the power back on.

The poor kid's parents have already begun complaints to the relevant authorities. I'll be meeting a lawyer tomorrow about breaking my lease.",legaladvice
My daughter was bit by a raccoon with rabies. My wife does not want to give our daughter the rabies series because its a vaccine. I am taking her tonight to a hospital against my wifes wishes in secret.,"My daughter was playing with a wild raccoon last night and got bit. I killed a raccoon in the area foaming at the mouth. Not sure if its the same one but refuse to take the chance. 

My wife vehemently refused the rabies series because its a vaccine. I am in panic mode and I am taking her to a hospital over 50 miles away near Dallas. 

Can I kidnap my own daughter? There is not a custody agreement in place because we are married and not separated. Probably will be soon though. 

I need to know what to watch out for here and what to say to police if I get stopped. Rabies is fatal so I am not playing with this one. 

I am leaving here in 10 minutes so just need to know a few things. 

Is it kidnapping in this case?

Will I be arrested? 

What do I do if she calls in an amber alert?

I am desperate.",legaladvice
(UPDATE) NSW Australia. Last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. I jumped out because I'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. I now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.,"[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a2bj15/nsw_australia_last_month_a_friend_began_to_cross/)

I went to a lawyer my parents had used a few years ago and they recommended. She took one look at the letter from my friend Aaron's lawyers and said she has concerns about it, and she'd respond. 

She contacted his lawyer, and my lawyer mailed me to tell me Aaron's lawyers aren't his lawyers at all, but to contact her if I heard more otherwise no need for more action.

Aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. He wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. I hadn't complained to them myself so I did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

Update - Dog Ate Neighbor's Drone,"*Edit: [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

A small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

I was served a summons by a Sheriff's Deputy, neighbor decided to take me to Small Claims over his drone. My MIL is a paralegal secretary, so I was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. He seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. He also suggested I counter sue and how I could possibly add in more damages. 

He also told me that my neighbor and I technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under FAA regulations. I called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). I don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. They took my information and have called me back once, so I know they're investigating but don't know anything else. Not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

I brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos I had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. His main argument to the judge was that I ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which I (somehow) trained him to do"". Which, yes I had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so I have somewhere to sit and eat outside. I argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. In the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). He is also banned from flying over my property, and I installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. He seems pretty upset with me, so I wanted to be careful. 

The only thing that could make this better is if the FAA finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.",legaladvice
Doctor's office keeps telling my mom my test results. I'm 22 and no longer even live with her.,"Background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. My GP who I have seen since I was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. I moved away for college when I was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new GP and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since I've seen him half my life. 

I get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication I take to make sure that I'm not getting too little/too much. The results of this information or the fact that I have those tests done isn't a big secret I want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless I were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. 

The first time I had this work done, I hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. They even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/mL the medication level was. Again, it's not like to my mother this is anything I want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and I never received any call about my results. I go in for these monthly, so the next month that I went I told the woman working in the lab of the office that I wanted to update my information to make sure I got the results (I thought also since I had been seeing this doctor since I was 10 I probably had never given them my phone number). A few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; I again got no call from the office. Once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when I explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, I was a little tipped off that I wasn't called again. I chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. 

At this visit I had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. He asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. I wasn't worried that I was pregnant, but I knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. I asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. It did, so on my way out I stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that I and I alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. They nonchalantly agreed and I asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. I happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. My mom BLEW UP at me asking why I needed to take a pregnancy test (I didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). That all blew over, but at this point I was pissed that she kept getting this information. 

I ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of HIPAA and she knows it after working in a hospital. She laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since I was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, ""it's not a big deal - I'm your mom!""

Since then, I've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. To no surprise there are no issues. I don't really know what to do here. Since I cut ties with that doctor, I no longer have personal problems with this, but I'm sure other people do without even knowing it. I don't have resources really for a lawyer. I might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. So how serious is it really?

Mother took 500$ dollars from my account to pay tithing that I said I don't want to pay,"So my parents are heavily Mormon and we just recently had a tithing settlement and when they asked me if I had paid my tithing I told them no. They then asked me if I had a plan to fix that and I told them that I worked too hard just to give that money away.

Anyways so afterwards, my mom, who is my account co-owner as I am under 18, decided to take 10% of my bank account out and refuses to give it back.

This isn't legal right?

*Update: I plan to slowly over the next few days, withdraw the money over time. I will leave some in as to not look suspicious. I will try talking to my mom about paying the 500$ just to keep her on my good side. 

*Update 2: Ok now this has gotten ridiculous.

Turns out my dad is sick of my mom overspending so he did two things. He's stopped paying tithing himself and swapped my moms credit card for a debit card. My mom took my money to pay off tithing for him and she gave me roughly 200$ back. She said she'll give me the rest back and that she's still disappointed in me for not paying my tithing. I'm at a loss what to do next.

*Update 3: Doesn't sound like I'm getting my money back any time soon, both my parents are in a significant amount of debt, my parents fought a lot yesterday apparently. My mom spent almost 10,000$ on stuff for the past month or so. My dad has started making cuts in our budget to fix this, tithing being one of them. 

I'm still following through with taking my money and putting it in a place where my parents can't touch it. Just in case they get any ideas.",legaladvice
[CO] My retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. I fear that she intends to abuse other children and I want to stop it. I have proof of her abuse against me. How do I go about this?,"Between the ages of 9-11, I took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. If memory serves, I believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that I took lessons with her. The only reason I stopped going to her was because she retired. 

My teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". I won't get into specifics, but I have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

I never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

Recently, I found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. I am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and I want to stop it before it's too late.

So my question is: legally, what can I do and what should my course of action be? I don't want money, I just want her stopped.

I have the photographs, but I am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

Please walk me through this, because I genuinely don't know what to do, and I'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because I didn't stop it sooner.

"UPDATE Neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. Now she's trying to sue me. We're the ones with 29k in medical bills. NC USA","Here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=JSCE6BW3&sh=7f56780f


My sister and I spent the weekend after I posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
The guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
He is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

Ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

The neighbors mean dog has been put down.  She was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

We've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

Our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

She was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
One from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  I'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

One for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

Her lawsuit against me has a court date of March 5th.  After she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   She then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

She finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

Our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in NC where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

Now for some extra facts. 

My left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on February 27th. 

Our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  The vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  She still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

The destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

The day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  She broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  She straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  She also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

We called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. They asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

Our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

The video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  It shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. It also shows her audibly laughing during it. She only started trying to help when I started smashing her dog into the ground. 

We also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the HOA. 

He said it's pointless to go after the HOA and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  Our lawyer did tell us that the HOA has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

There was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

I honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

Either way, my sister and I both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of March. 

Thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. You guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

I'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer whatever I can.

I went to my parents and talked to them and they have begun to see that they were wrong too.

The owner was genuinely happy with us for this so i'm glad we did that. The girl who who my brother touched was also at the store and despite what many of you said I felt that I needed to apologize to her too because she deserved it after my actions and she thanked me for it. My parents are now looking into different options to deal with my brother including therapy and other programs.

I really want to end this by saying thank you for helping me learn I was wrong. Like I said I'm sorry if i hurt anyone with my post, I didn't mean to do that but it was wrong of me too.

I've decided not to press charges, I don't really have the money/time for it, and all I needed was my medical expenses paid. I just plan on not going to any family gatherings where he is for a long long LONG time.

A former Air BnB guest put a hold on my mail for everyone at my address and has been paying to hold the mail for 2 months! (Texas),"Its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  One guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  A lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  One lady missed the receipt of a Death Certificate.  We thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  So I tried calling the USPS and that got me nowhere.  Going down in person was the only way to do this I guess.  Turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal PO Box?  Who knows.  The post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  Still, how could this have happened?  Surely this can't be legal.  I got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  She hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one. 

Edit:  Well that was quick~!  The Post Office called me directly before I could even report her and pro-actively already reported this lady to the postal inspector.  They're very certain what she did is illegal.  Thanks /u/BeamDriver for the advice!

Can you legally steal your own property hours after a police officer hands it to the thief?,"Yesterday my phone was stolen at lunch and I chased down the girl who stole it making a scene in the mall. A Plano police officer overheard the commotion and came over.

The girl tried to say I was trying to steal her phone. I told the officer that I could unlock the phone and the girl could not, I told him my pictures are on the phone, my bank information was on the phone, and basically my entire life was there to prove it was mine. 

He refused to give me the chance or believe me. He told me to back off and leave her alone or he would arrest me. 

I left. 

The girl was wearing a uniform of one of the shops in the mall so I decided to check back 2 hours later. I saw her set my phone down by the cash register of her work after failing again to break into my phone. 

When no one was in her store and her back was turned I took my phone back. 

Before anyone starts going off on me for it, I know. I know exactly what I did was extremely stupid but I am still paying for that phone so...yeah. 

I am asking for the legalities of it.

The phone was set on a counter and not in an area that would be considered employee only, the store was open, and the phone is legally mine. 

The place is obviously heavily video monitored so there is no doubt that I am on video. My questions are simply did I break any laws?

If the phone was on the counter, not behind the register but on the counter, the store was open and I was not asked to leave, and the phone is legally my property did I break the law?

EDIT: Thanks for all of the info. I do not wish to pursue a police complaint nor do I wish to report the crime. I am too lazy for that.

[Update] Girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. I don't. What are my rights? (Texas),"[This is my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice) 

Short version: I'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

Long version:

If you remember, I asked about how I should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. I listened to the suggestions. Got a lawyer. Put myself on the registry as well.

She really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. I was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. But in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. So we had no messy legal right over it.

The childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. My lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. Her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

So I have my baby daughter!

Taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. I feel like I have something to live for! My family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. I also got a promotion at work. I realized that I need to be more ambitious because I now have a baby to provide for. A higher position was open at my work and I asked for the promotion but they told me I'm too young. I offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that I can do it. After a month they gave me the job! 

As most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), I had my lawyer file for child support after I had full custody. My ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. She actually called me names and various insults and all of that. But I didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. She said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. I don't know. I didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but I think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. I didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, I'm not good at studying) but I want to make sure my daughter has the chance! My sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and I think I'll send most of the child support payments there once I start receiving them.

Thank you all. ",legaladvice

So in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""Good luck with the mortgage and bills, I've taken MY money out of our bank account and turned off your card on MY credit"".

I obviously need an attorney, I logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. What resources can I begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until I can find childcare and a job? Is there anything I can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney?

It didn't take long before my mom caught on that I was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  My mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because I had been ""corrupted"" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound.

In the end my dad made it so I would not have to go with them but the only ""safe"" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. I stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. My mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and ""save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: My step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month I was coming no matter what. 

&#x200B;

After a week of this, everything changed. My mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. Me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. My sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. During this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  After this my mom called me one last time.

&#x200B;

She proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". All to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand I was being used by evil.""During these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn I was."" According to her I am a ""evil seed"" and that I not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". I also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. She told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. She ended by telling me that I was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". The last contact I know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

At the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. I moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then.

"[ON] I caught my neighbors son stealing my underwear/other things. Family refuses to believe me or my landlord, and is threatening to sue me for slander. What can i do? - UPDATE","My original post is here: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ayhlsu/on_i_caught_my_neighbors_son_stealing_my/)

Thank you to everyone pointing out i was an idiot and i should have called the police to make a report.

A long story short i went to station made a report, gave them all the details i had along with showing them a copy of the security camera footage of both incidents that my landlord was kind enough to send to me. Thee police officer didn't seem to really care from my impression, but he made a report. No one to my knowledge ever came out or anything. 

Anyways today the father, and son came to my door today and he basically apologized for accusing me of lying, and made his son apologize to me (awkward..), and gave me a bag consisting of my clothing. I told him i didn't particularly want to that stuff again, and was going to throw it out (just the idea of keeping it made me disgusted). So the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.

I am satisfied i guess, the entire situation seems extremely uncomfortable and akward. ",legaladvice
Dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. How do I protect myself legally?,"I have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. A few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

The last few months have been hell. They have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. They are loud way past our community quiet hours. They have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). I have recorded it. It wakes up my 2 year old. Do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

They leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. It has ruined my outdoor rug. I took pictures. 

They drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

They regularly park in the reserved spot I pay for monthly. It is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. They are an extra $50 a month. The minute I leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until I threaten to involve the apt. Manager.

They have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

They like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. I have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. It ruined my potted plants outside. 

I have reported all the incidents. I have tried to ask them to cut it out. They don't care. 

I recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out I am not the first to complain that day. The police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (I am not sure of how it was found. I stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

Since then they have taken to recording me any time I leave my apartment. They have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

The woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how I am impeding her ability to exist in public because I am racist. She says I call the police on her for doing nothing. I only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

I understand I am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. I would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

I just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot I pay for monthly, and play loud music I can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

She had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

They have really upped the bleach game too. It has gotten on a few spots on my door and I am scared they might throw it at my car. 

I have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. I can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

I can't lose my job and I am not sure how protect myself legally. 

They are actually my paid space right now but I am scared to have them towed because I don't know what they are going to do. I pay for that space. I have proof. The sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

If I tell the apartment they will have the car towed but I'll look like a racist. 

All it takes is one video and a lie and I am ruined. 

I want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but I think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that I pay for is reasonable. But maybe not?",legaladvice
Boyfriend and I slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. Landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out,"This happened in Ontario, Canada.

So this past Friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

I found out about it the next night at work (I work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and I were the night before. He filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

For more context, on the 24th of October a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. It has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (I sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

All we asked for was the alarm for our unit. Luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

Boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

I dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. My dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. But I don't know. Came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in Ontario. 

EDIT: More direct questions; should we pursue action and report? If we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? I know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. I could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

TLDR: Boyfriend and I were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. Basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

Caretaker left cat without access to water for days and died as a result,"I went out of town for 5 days and a co worker offered to check on my 4 cats while I was away. I came home to find they had no food or water and their litter box hadn't been cleaned in days. My oldest girl was in really bad shape, she couldn't move her back legs at all. I thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. Took her to the ICU and the doctor ran a lot of tests. The doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. She was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. This caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. She suffered for two days in the ICU before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. There was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering. I stayed by her side as they euthanized her. That was about 3 days ago. My heart is in pieces. 
There is no signed document of my friend agreeing to watch my cats. But I have text messages of when I tried to check in on them, then 42 messages in the morning and another 4 hours worth of messages from this friend trying to blame me for not reminding her and not telling her about an undiagnosed condition and even blaming me for trusting her.

I know I'm angry and grieving. But because of what this person did my cat suffered for days until I had to let her go.

"Son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts.","This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him. 

We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

Once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". Okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""Do not worry! This won't happen again"". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers not parents.""

We have no issues for a while until this week. Some parent brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.

We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.",legaladvice
Neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard,"Update: I'll be sure to post updates so please stop PMing me or replying to my comments/post history outside of this sub asking me to do so or suggesting I shit-bomb them back. 

My wife noted that what we think might be his kid comes around most weekends. In the interest of remaining neighborly and with the possibility neighbor dude might be losing his mind, we're going to talk with them before lawyering up or involving the fuzz. Updates forthcoming.

Original post:
Hey all, I have a shitty situation here that I'm hoping to get some advice about. This is in Idaho.

&#x200B;

My neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. A new neighbor bought a house across the street about 6 months ago. A few weeks back, I was working in the garage when I saw him take his dog directly across the street, into my front yard. He let it pee in my yard and then walked straight home. He didn't notice me  - my garage is set up as a shop and is pretty busy, and the garage door is up a lot - but this piqued my interest because it's goddamned weird. Now, my wife and I have a dog so there are a few dog droppings from her that we pick up on a regular basis. My wife had been doing the dooty duty recently, so I asked her if there are more piles than normal. Sure enough, she said there had been a ton for a while now. She figured it was assholes walking their dogs and letting them crap in our lawn. I figured it was our new weirdo neighbor.

&#x200B;

It happened again around a week later: I was in the garage as the neighbor took his dog into our lawn. This time the dog dropped a deuce and he started to walk away without picking it up. I called out to him, asking him if he needs a plastic bag to pick up after his dog, and he avoided eye contact and scurried back home.  I went across the street and knocked on his door. He didn't answer. We set up a security camera to discretely watch the front lawn and I kept an eye out for when he was next out in his yard so I could talk to him.

&#x200B;

I reviewed the footage over the next few days and, sure enough, he was consistently taking his dog to do the deed in our yard. Why our yard? No clue, we've never had any interaction with this guy whatsoever. The next time I saw him walking to his car, I confronted him. I simply told him that I knew he was taking his dog to shit in our yard and if I caught him doing it again I'd call the police to report him for trespassing. He denied doing it, claiming it must be other neighbors, got in his car, and drove away with me standing in his driveway.

&#x200B;

So I review the footage from the last few days. Dude is not walking his dog into my yard anymore: he's letting the dog shit in his yard. He then scoops it up, walks it across the street, and tosses it into my yard with a shovel. What the absolute fuck.

"(update) [Nebraska] I just closed on a new house, sellers allege that I owe a portion of their 990$ security system cancellation fee because I did not take over their contract. Threatening small claims court.","https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9h80ot/nebraska_i_just_closed_on_a_new_house_sellers/?ref=share&ref_source=link

Thank you to all of the people who commented on the original thread. This was my first time dealing with small claims court and all of the helpful advice and information really helped set me up for success.


So, short story is that the sellers did end up taking me to court for roughly $1,400. This was for the total cost of the contract buy out for their security system, travel expenses since they moved out of state and would need to pay for gas and lodging to come back to sue us, as well as court costs. 


Small claims court was surprisingly straight forward and informal. I've never been a big talker, but I honestly don't think I was able to say more than three words at a time without the plaintiff interrupting me. The judge eventually asked her to please stand in the hall way so I could speak my side fully. She absolutely refused to leave, but did stay quiet for a short minute so I could say that I never agreed to take over her security contract, and there was no documentation to suggest that I did.


The judge agreed and ended up ruling in my favor. I thought it was done there but the plaintiff swiftly appealed the decision. So now we had a new court date early this month with a different judge. 


During this time the plaintiff continues to send me hostile emails and voice messages. The seller's broker (their realtors boss) called me while I was at work to tell me he was very displeased I filed a formal complaint against his realtor. He told me I was not welcome to pursue any future business with his company, and I assured him the feeling was mutual. The broker said he supports all of his realtors and will not be acting on the complaint in any way. So I went and talked to the mayor's office about the situation. The mayor asked me what I wanted out of this, and I showed him the hostile emails from the seller and told him I felt it was the realtor's job to act as an in-between, even after the sell was complete. The mayor said he would step in and speak with the broker. (This is a fairly small town, they probably already knew each other). 


I never heard from the seller again after that, thanks mayor. So now it comes time for round 2 in small claims court. The new judge goes through and reads the write up from round 1 and asked the plaintiff if there is new evidence or information that has not been covered. Long story short, there was not. The judge ended up sustaining the previous ruling in my favor, and strongly advised the plaintiff not to appeal unless there is new evidence or information that has not been seen by the court.


It's been five days and no word on an appeal so I think it's safe to say I'm finally done and ready to put this whole ugly thing behind me. Once again thank you to all of you who helped me on the original thread. I'm very pleased that resources like this community exist.


On a final note, gossip, but I got a call from the mayor at 2am the night before last because there was a house fire down the street from me. (The mayor and I know each other well). So I went to go help the volunteer fire brigade put it out. We got it under control and we were winding down when a deputy from the sheriff's office comes to tell me that the lady who sued me waited around the court building the day of the appeal for the judge to get off, then tried to confront him about the ruling in the courthouse parking lot. I didn't really care to hear about it, but it sounds like she's in some pretty deep shit now. Kind of cathartic.


TL;DR: They lost and I think it's finally over.

EDIT: thank you for all of the very kind and thoughtful messages! To clarify some common questions, the ruling stipulated that the plaintiff pays all court costs, including my own. Yes, I could probably countersue, but I'm very interested in dealing with the seller and broker as little as possible for the rest of my life. :)

Please do not take this post as a representation of Nebraska, most people here are actually quite nice. There's a couple rotten apples in every bunch.",legaladvice
Police broke into my home because my child cried during the night while I was asleep,"This has been a really weird morning... not sure if I chose the correct flair

I have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. He sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). Lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. I put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. Around 3am I got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. She gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.

At 6:30am I am awoken by a single low knocking sound. I get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point I usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more Z's). As I exit my room I am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. I dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if I should serve them a drink. One cop asks me who I am to which I reply with my full name and ask what is going on. He continues his interrogation, asking If I live with a woman. Fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. I answer that I live with my girlfriend. The cop asks me if I have a son to which I reply yes. He asks me where he is. At this point I lean over the wall and I see my door busted upen. I am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so I look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. I see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop ""he is there, what is going on!?"" The tell me to step out into the dining room and I put my hands up as I walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. I sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. I look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex I live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.

 The cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. He says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. He claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. They never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. My apartment has weird acoustics and I cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.

He asks me why I didnt hear him and I told him I must have been deeply asleep. He asks if I am under the influence of drugs and I say I just went to bed late because I was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. As the cops leave I could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. The cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. I asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. I asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...

So now I am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. I fear when I go outside I'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.

I have been trying to understand the timeline of events. I went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. If the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. My son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. The cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the ""detonatios"" NOT a crying child. My son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.

Is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? What about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? Was that just an excuse to burst in? He sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.

Update: Landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. Good news!,"Well, here's my update! And with good news!

So first of all, I just wanted to say: wow. The amount of support I received, both in replies and in PMs, was absolutely amazing. Everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. The person who said ""Sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

That said - I feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). He's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. He grew up in rural (Arkansas, I think? That or Alabama) and came to MA later in life. This was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. That, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

I know some of you were hoping I'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, I decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

Yesterday I sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. Everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. He realized VERY quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. He also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. He just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

We ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if I weren't having the conversation with him I'd think he were a caricature). He's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so I think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". He seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. I reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

He still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. He seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. He agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which I will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

The past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. If things go well, I might even potentially renew the lease come September. I'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but I think I'll leave the issue where it lies for now. If this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, I'll go at him with everything I can in the future - but for now I'm satisfied. I'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",legaladvice
[MN] A girl is planning to claim I am the father of her baby when we never had sex,"I've been living in a foster home since January '18. I turn 15 in March. The foster parent if you want to call her that is a woman with a weight and alcohol problem who loves to yell. She blames me for getting her daughter pregnant who is 22 and lives here. I never had sex with her, and I would choose death if it were a choice between that and having sex with her. Unless she somehow raped me without me remembering it, it's not mine, but she's going to put me down as the father anyway. The foster ""parent"" claims teenage boys can't control their hormones so it must have been me.

I can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court. I said I would go to the doctor with her and get a paternity test, and she thinks I will falsify it by giving someone else's semen sample.

NSW Australia. Last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. I jumped out because I'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. I now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.,"Long time LA reader here, and I'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story.

It'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. I'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. There was no way I'd go through the water as it looked, but because I'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river I didn't want to risk it. I didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. I said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

Aaron decided to push on and started moving and I panicked and got straight out. It was FAR more water than I'd had to go through when I near lost my car and life before. I got out well before the water though so I didn't let water in the car btw.

Aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. He was EXTREMELY lucky not to drown, and I ran down & helped him out. Immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. Admittedly I'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of eBay parts in the back so it's not like I'd have made much difference.

We phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. We haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. But on Friday I received a letter from a lawyer I know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. It's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because I made the car unsafe by getting out. It was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

I think he's being a dickhead. Someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? Ideally I'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what I think they'll be. I want to contact his lawyer to tell them Aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should I get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

I've spoken to several attorneys and law firms throughout the state and have settled on one and signed the papers and all that stuff today. I want to thank all of you for giving me advice on what to ask and look for when speaking to them all, it really helped in narrowing it down and figuring out who was the best to go with. I can't really give out a whole lot of information because we are just starting to gather all the pieces and put it all together. There most likely will not be any updates to this for quite some time.

To answer the endless messages I received about race, I am white and early 20's, the person I was misidentified as is also white but in his 30's.

I spoke to my boss and HR and will be back at work very soon and 2 months pay advance that will be paid back with OT. Also my landlord was really nice and is letting me pay the back rent over the next few months in installments.

"UPDATE - [MI, USA] Considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now I have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi\_usa\_considering\_suing\_my\_uncle\_after\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi_usa_considering_suing_my_uncle_after_he/)

I promised an update so here it is. First off, I want to thank everyone who strongly suggested I go see a doctor ASAP. I went to see an ENT and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. My hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. The tinnitus was still quite bad, so I wanted to see if the doc could help with that. He put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. I saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (This was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

The ringing has gone down considerably, and I'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. It still bothers me at night and while I'm trying to work sometimes. The biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. This has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point I'm far too behind schedule to complete it.

My uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. I'm not planning on suing him. He knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what I was going through. My aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. I haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. They have offered to call me and apologize but I don't want to talk to them. I just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. I'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but I don't care. Fuck that guy. Thanks for hearing my story and for all the advice.",legaladvice

Kicked our at 16. Parents took all my money.,"I had posted this on other subs and was told to post here. 16f.

Three nights ago my parents and I got in a huge fight. I am not a Christian. They are extreme bible thumpers. I am bisexual, they believe I'm going to be burning in hell. I was forced to come out of the closet due to blackmail reasons, and my parents promptly kicked me out. 

I managed to get my dogs and my keys, took my car and left. We just moved to this state so I have no friends. My siblings all have the same beliefs as my parents. My related family is all thousands of miles away. Last night, my parents cut off my phone plan and told me they're kicking me off of their insurance. Right now I am on my own with my two large dogs, pitbull and American bulldog, sleeping in my car. My parents forced me to quit my job last week so I could focus more on school. Last night I checked my bank account. My parents drained the 1k savings I had in it. It is completely empty. 

I'm just scared and don't know where to turn. I primarily want to be able to take care of my dogs. I do not want to give them up but I'm not sure how much longer I can without neglecting them. Giving them up would be out of absolute desperation. I will not give up on them easily. Having them around has protected me from many bad situations.

Work Punishments Include Drinking Soap and Other Abuse,"My girlfriend works at a retail store in California.

Other punishments include doing pushups, coworkers being allowed to hit you with a stick, drinking soap, eating dog food, and sucking on undesirable objects that are not meant for human consumption.

UPDATE 2.5: There's been lots of debate about whether the sling is allowed or not. AA told me: 1) Yes, medical devices are allowed. 2) I am protected under ACAA and ADA. 3) Technically on AA you don't need to always make a ""special request"" to allow the device. In most cases, you can just tell the crew that it's a medical device and they should understand. But for extra safety it helps to make a note on your profile about it. 4) There should be no obstructive items in the way during takeoff and landing. However this particular AA representative said that the sling is ""not an obstructive item"".

Amazon link for the curious: https://amzn.to/36xbjY3


UPDATE 2: AA called me, apologized for the FA ""escalating out of control"". They will open an internal investigation. I conveyed that I don't want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. 😞 But that it's up to AA to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. I don't want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. 

She assured me that I won't get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me. 

**I did not ask for compensation and told her that I'm NOT here on a vengeance.** Not here to make money or fame from AA. Nope. Did not make a dime from this and don't plan to. I will not be responding to media inquiries. https://imgflip.com/i/3f8i7p 

For those of you calling me obese and telling me to die - I'm a 120lb girl lol. I injured my foot and was hospitalized thus the sling. 

Forgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. Around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. It's just that I talked back (""no I don't but okay"") and I regret that so much. 

Halloween is over but she spooked me to the core. 

Someone asked if it's a racial thing. I'm not white but it's probably not a related to race.

UPDATE 1: Thank you so much for your quick advice on a Sunday morning! I memorized some of the lines you wrote below.

As we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija

""The police will contact you when you get home. You will be banned from future flights."" 

""Ok."" 

""Oh I hope so."" As she walked away. 

I burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. She won. 

There was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my Miranda rights. I made it home in one piece. Still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future AA flights. I've been an emotional wreck and can't stop crying. My Thanksgiving and Holiday flights are both on AA. 

My seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. They gave me their business card in case I need a witness. 

Thank you again for your helpful comments. I am not in jail (yet) at least!

Original post: 

I can't believe this is happening to me. I'm flying from Chicago to Boston now and police are waiting for me when I land, so I don't have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

Edit: I've looked all over the internet and can't find any FAA rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

Here's what happened:

..

I was on an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Boston on November 3rd, 2019. Because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, I use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. This sling is often advertised on Facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

Right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. I am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

""You have to put your feet on the ground!"" I cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

""No I don't but okay."" As I put my feet down. Emphasizing again. **I complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** Although I had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights I've taken with my foot sling, I complied. I put my feet down immediately. 

Even if it's technically not allowed by some rule I'm not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

She immediately escalated: 
""Would you like to go back to the gate? We're gonna go back to the gate!"" And immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

But right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

She came back to my seat and barked: 
""Police will be waiting for you when we land in Boston.""

My seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. I had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, ""no I don't but okay"" are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

Her statement caused me to panic inside. I'm now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

So I took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight.

"My niece's (5) school allowed a person to visit her at lunch and bring her a drink, all without this person being on the list of people my sister (26) approved to have contact with her.","Located in Oklahoma, USA

My sister and I have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. Our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. My niece told my sister about it when she got home. My sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. So they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. 

The principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. The only thing I can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? They risked my niece's safety and I think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but I'm not sure what could be done.

Update: My sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. The board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. The school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution.

[UPDATE] I'm pregnant and being investigated by DCS.,"[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5smsoi/indiana_im_pregnant_and_being_investigated_by_dcs/) is my original post. When I made it, I was advised to get a lawyer right away. I was also advised that Indiana's DCS doesn't investigate pregnant women who don't already have kids, and that the woman claiming to be a social worker might be an imposter.

I contacted and met with a lawyer, and explained the situation to him. He seemed to agree that something was very fishy. To make a long story short, the woman ""handling our case"" has no affiliation with DCS. 

I'm still in complete shock.

We went straight to the police. They're taking this very seriously. I can't give a lot of details because it's an ongoing investigation, but she seems to have been a very skilled/well-researched liar. I never would have known anything was amiss without the advice of this subreddit and the intervention of my attorney. I feel like a complete idiot, but the instinct to cooperate unquestioningly when faced with an intimidating ""authority figure"" is strong.

I haven't had the baby yet. We're staying at a trusted family member's home until the baby is born. My OB and the hospital we'll be delivering at have already been informed of the situation, and will be taking the appropriate security measures. I'm still freaking out, but we're taking every precaution for the safety of my child, and hopefully everything will turn out okay.

Left her at a daycare with a group size of 11 and 3 care providers.

I jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she'd found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (I have no reason to doubt the woman's intentions because there was a police station on this road.) 

I drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.

I was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a Good Samaritan that I just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her.

When I saw it, I told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and I also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that I told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

The movie ended around 9:10 pm and I had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. I told her I'd be up to tuck her in.

He mother was SCREAMING into the phone ""YOU TELL HIM FUCK YOU! YOU CAN SAY THAT! I SAY ITS OK FOR YOU TO TELL YOUR FATHER FUCK YOU!!""

I took the phone from my daughter and I said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

She yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn't true at all. 

I asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. My ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

I handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear ""daddy is going to leave the room now, please don't stay on the phone long, it's way past your bedtime."" (Bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was Saturday night so I bent the bedtime a bit). 

I had to get my stepson to bed (he's a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

I walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she's repeating ""I'm sorry"" into the phone. I fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

I walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

It wasn't until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. She had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

I sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. She was really upset and wouldn't speak much. I hugged her. My daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her.

"UPDATE: Hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. Building management's negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (TO, Canada)","Link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

First I want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and I are quite happy with. I've been very active on Reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. It has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. I digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

Through the advice I received on this subreddit, I contacted the city and the health department right away. I was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. The more we spoke the more interested he became. He called and asked me ""if I were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would I be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?"" To which I replied ""150%"". He then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, I said ""no."" 

Shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. I went out and asked them why. They told me they were instructed to because they don't want people panicking etc. I told them they were to leave it there as I have called the city and they are on their way. They didn't seem happy. As if the whole floor isn't already in a panic anyway. Literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. I also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. I have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. This lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

I explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. According to Toronto Health and Bylaws that is bullshit. The situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. The bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information I have been receiving from the building management. 

The bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. I heard nothing until Monday. Come Monday morning I get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that Wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. They will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. The cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. I'm guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

The city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. I do not believe them at all. We have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they ""didn't know"" and will be handing it over. From what I understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. Now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. I have the personal contact information for the officer I spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. We went from ""submit a maintenance request"" to ""we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately"" in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

Thank you so much Reddit!!! I couldn't have done it without your help!!

We called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. We start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iPhone and seen where he was and we headed there.

We got there at maybe 1:15PM and were completely stonewalled. No one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. Which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. He spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing Nerf guns (this is important later).

We continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. She wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30PM and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7PM. They did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

We get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". Nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. They never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""Creepers"" from their Minecraft game. They painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

When they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. We've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

They kept offering him McDonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. They asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. They kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

The school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. We can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. What the hell do we do?

Edit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords.",legaladvice
"[NE & CO] My mom wants to have me ""repossessed"" from college and taken home by force over state lines. Can she do that?","For some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. She has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since I've moved out for college. She demands access to absolutely everything I have. This will be important later.

&#x200B;

I'm 18 years old, and I'm a college freshman. I go to college in Colorado, but I was born and raised in Nebraska. In Nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. It was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. Like I said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when I do things that are outside of her reach.

&#x200B;

My mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. Email, WhatsApp, Facebook (even though I haven't used it in years), Twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if I don't give it to her. In the past, I've rolled over and taken it. It was a survival mechanism more than anything. If I'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. She justifies this by claiming that because I have autism, I can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200B;

About a month ago, I changed all my passwords. Sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that I need to give her my new passwords. I tell her no. This is where trouble begins.

&#x200B;

Over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. She's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. Although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. A week ago, she showed up here and I had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. That pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200B;

Recently, though, as in last night, I was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" I asked her to clarify and she said that because I'm still a minor in Nebraska, and I'm a resident of Nebraska, I have to abide by Nebraska's laws and as such, I am still a minor and she can do that. I wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like I wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as I've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. It's not nice. I do not want to be gooned and taken home. I don't want to face my mother again.

&#x200B;

So the question is this: can she do that? Is the Fugitive Slave Act not dead after all? Does my having autism change the circumstances any? If all else fails, what can I do to protect myself?",legaladvice
(va) My son stole a rare toy from my brother. My brother is refusing to take it back and is threatening to get the police involved. What do I do?,"Right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. Here is the story.

&#x200B;

Last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. While we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. My brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what I know it's one of his biggest hobbies. Well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

&#x200B;

Well, until yesterday. My brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and I needed to return it immediately. I honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. Well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a Boba Fett figure from his collection. He confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.

&#x200B;

I was furious and took it from him. Here is the problem though, after I confirmed with my brother it was his I found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. Apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. So my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. Well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. I told him I would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, what are my options here? I can't afford to pay him back right now. If he does go the police will my son get arrested? He's only 15. It was very wrong of him to do but I think my brother is over reacting. What can I expect if he does take me to court or call the police?",legaladvice

"Bored middle age neighbor has been giving me a hard time because I dress like a ""hussy"", is that a crime?","I have been accused of a litany of sexual crimes, some against children because of the way I dress. My neighbor is so adamant about all of this she's got me a bit worried. 

About a month ago, I moved in with my sister and her boyfriend into a neighborhood that's mostly families. I didn't expect any trouble. My first introduction to this woman, let's call her Karen, was my first week here. I went to check the mail and I wasn't wearing a bra. I had on a baggy t shirt and basketball shorts, though. Karen is one of *those* Southern women who spend all day in their yards, pretending to garden, but are really spying on their neighbors. You know the type. She waved at me and I waved back, trying to be pleasant. She came at me, I thought to make a proper introduction, or whatever, but she started lecturing me about not having on a bra.

It was creepy and weird. I am not at all well endowed, I go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not Karen. Karen urged me to think of her children and Jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. It was so goddamn weird, I felt like laughing in her face, but I didn't want there to be issues so I said I'd be more diligent in the future and Karen went about her business.

Well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for Karen, y'all, oh no. Not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. Karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. While my breasts are small and humble, I am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

The second time Karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. She threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated I got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a Jezebel and that I needed Jesus. Because I was wearing Jean shorts.

We live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and I like to go out for walks, but it seems every time I step foot out of my door, there's fucking Karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. It's getting annoying. 

This is in Florida, by the way.

EDIT: I got dressed up in my skimpiest daisy dukes that barely cover my ass and a legit camel toe, a half shirt with no bra on, my abs exposed to check the mail (I do not regularly dress like this) I must have been quite a sight to Karen who immediately stormed over once she spotted me, nearly knocking over her lawn chair she stood up so fast. She started laying into me. I just stood there letting her bump her gums for a minute then I said ""you can stop the games, Karen. I see the way you look at me, I know you want me."" Her face went beet red and she stammered out, ""I'll pray for you."" Then scurried away. Actually went inside her house. 😂",legaladvice

My mom's defibrillator malfunctioned and shocked her 40+ times at 600V. The doctor's all denied responsibility for the cause. It put my parents hundreds of thousands of dollars into medical debt.,"Location: US. Original incident happened in Indiana.

I should first and foremost say that this happened about 10 years ago, so at this point I doubt it's possible to do anything about the situation.

&#x200B;

When I was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. She thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. This led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. It turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

&#x200B;

It could be some form of PTSD I suffered from seeing my mom nearly die in my arms, but her defibrillator almost triggered again today and it brought back those memories. She told me that her and my dad tried to pinpoint who was responsible (the company who made the wires, the defibrillator company, etc.) but all of the doctors she saw denied responsibility.

Is there anything they can do at this point? I feel like she suffered so much and was given absolutely zero compensation for what happened. It makes me furious knowing how much pain she went through and nothing was done about it.",legaladvice
A male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. He just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists.,"Spa is in Maryland. A friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it's ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. He is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. He has not spoken with management yet. He just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. Any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

Edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

Minor update: I advised him of his many options after reading the comments. He went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. Mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

I'm guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. The mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room.

"New York- Mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while I was babysitting 4 year old step sister","Hi folks

I'm a 21 year old college student. My parents separated soon after I was born, and my my mom raised me alone until I was 15. She met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister Eliza. She's grown up with me, and I often baby sit for her for short periods of time. I live with a roomate in apartments owned by the College

Late last week, my stepfather's mom died. He's Polish, so my mom and he left for Poland leaving me to babysit Eliza for a week. Yesterday, I got a call from my stepfather's sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in Poland. I've tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it's starting to sink in that this is real

I have no idea what to do. My biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. My mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the USA that I am aware of. I'm studying Political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but I have no job and no salary. 

Eliza has no family other than me that I can turn to. I'm not ready to take of a child, but I also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she's my little sister, and I've been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. But we also look very different- my dad is Jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. So I'm a tall, mixed race dude while Eliza is a small blonde girl (I bring this up because I was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn't get sorted out till my mom showed up).

So what do I do? I'm barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and I haven't even told Eliza yet. It just hit me that we're now alone, and I now have to step up to the plate and take care of Eliza. I have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

We talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  This has not helped.  We escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  Not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

The principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""

The principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

I went to school and asked what's going on. I did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

First, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. Second, the principal explained the situation to me. It had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. Thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

When I asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. I asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

I told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. I told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat I'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

Up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

I talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. He only knew that she had left the school. He showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

In short: they backed off after I made sure they understood that I won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

Small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. Someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. I will try talking to them to make sure. They deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at. ",legaladvice

**Old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that I was having a ton of issues. I found out my therapist is her husband, but I didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200B;

**New developments summary**: There's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. I even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200B;

**New developments, continued**: Therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). I have a very peculiar family dynamic, so I think he talked about that. However, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. Unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that I was depressed and had family issues. Neat. One of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. Understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200B;

**Resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than I thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. Therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. I don't know if he'll practice again.

I suspect my step-mom attempted to poison my dying dad's food. I managed to procure specimen in question. What do I do now?,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit. Sorry for the wall of text, but my head is spinning and I don't know what to do. Let me break down some background first:

&#x200B;

My dad is currently dying of liver failure. He's in end-stage, at-home hospice care.  We have nurses and social workers that visit every single day in the hospital bed we set up to help care and clean him up. The man is incontinent and can barely move unassisted. He's taking light doses of morphine and Lorazepam so that he can sleep. The consensus seems to be that he'll be lucky to make to Thanksgiving....

&#x200B;

My step-mom has a very shady history....she has three dead husbands  prior to my dad from whom she collects monthly in the sums of many thousands combined.  There was a fourth man after that she got engaged to after a mere 6 months, who died under mysterious circumstances, and she fought to take as many of his valuable possessions from under the noses of his children as she could. (My dad would be the 5th man)

She's euthanized 2 of her own dogs and 1 of her own cats....herself. NOT through any Vet or other official. She is barred from EVERY animal shelter and adoption agency in the STATE as a result.

So with that pre-established pattern in mind....let me bring you to last night.

&#x200B;

She brought in a ""home-made"" tuna fish sandwich to feed my dad, because he barely eats anymore, and it's somewhat of a thrill when he requests something. He was lucid and alert, laughing and joking. In a matter of LESS THAN A MINUTE after devouring half the sandwich, he began to have the most extreme reaction I've ever seen him have:  his eyes rolled back, he began to seriously convulse, let out a series of loud groans and moans....his face contorted, and he was completely unresponsive to all outside stimuli - lights, loud voices, touch, you name it. Before I even put two and two together, she's asking him (a little too enthusiastically) ""Do you see the light yet??? Do you see all the pretty angels??"" (WTF????). He's been in an essentially catatonic state since. Out cold for the past 12 hours. It was a transformation that happened mid-sentence as he was speaking. In tears, I begged him to squeeze my hand if he could hear me, but....no dice. I was truly scared and genuinely thought I was going to lose him right then and there. We called Hospice to send a nurse over (instead of calling 911, which is what we've been instructed to do. They are on staff 24/7). She wasn't sure what the catalyst for this episode was, but she did say that his vitals were okay and that this is a normal part of the dying process, and that if anything, we will be seeing things like this more often, and that it could also possibly be the drugs.

But he's been on them for weeks, at low, very controlled doses, and NOTHING like this has ever happened. I'm just a lay person, but that did NOT seem normal, and it's very suspicious to me that it happened IMMEDIATELY following the food, like flipping a light switch.

Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe i'm reading too much into it.  But I managed to wrap up the other half of the sandwhich in plastic wrap, and keep it refridgerated. My first thought is to get it analyzed in some lab somewhere....but....where? Is that even a thing? Do I take it to the police and tell them my suspicions? A hospital?

With him being in the dying stage already, is it even worth pursuing??

Again, if it weren't  for this woman's history, I probably wouldn't think anything of it....

Any and all feedback would be much appreciated. I'll do my best to answer any questions as well. ",legaladvice
Minnesota: Landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. What now?,"For some background I am renting an apartment and my lease ends on September 30th. My landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. I do have a lease that says I get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which I believe is the law itself, but in this case I did not get that notice.

Last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8AM saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). He asked if I could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing I'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

I did not see these messages until I took lunch at 12. I texted my landlord back saying I thought I am supposed to get notice for entry and I'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though I'm sure that doesn't legally count).

Long story short they robbed me and I have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. They took everything of value such as laptop and TV and even some stupid things like my lamps.

My renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). Now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and I should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

Meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. He met them at Dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. I told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place I would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

What now? Push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? I would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.",legaladvice
