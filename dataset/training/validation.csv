"if i don't let my daughter put a lock on her door? my daughter has recently turned 16 and, for a couple of months now, has been constantly asking for a lock to be put on her door.  she says it's to keep her brother out - who barges into her room every now and then to bother her - but i'm not sure if the benefit is worth having the lock in place.

i don't like the secrecy of her locking herself in her room and i'm worried she's trying to hide something from me or that she'll take the opportunity to lock me out. i admit that i've forgotten to knock sometimes but other than that i see no reason as to why she'd need a lock. 

the way i see it, it's my house and i am simply unwilling to have any locks put in anywhere. she's young, and doesn't really know what's she's asking for.

so, if i don't let her get the lock installed?",3
"because i finally learned how to wipe my butt i asked my girlfriend the other day, ""why do the doors of the bathroom stalls have space on the bottom?""

she told me they're like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a ""duh\~"" tone.

i followed up by saying, ""but sometimes, people can see my butt.""

she started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.

so i had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; i wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.

i then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/(http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and i was shocked.

we were both curious where/how i even learned that from.

was it a potty training error? apparently not. we asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, & uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.

so, i've been wiping my butt and mooning hundreds of people in bathroom stalls for 20 years of my life.

\#dead

tl;dr

for 20 years, i squatted all the way to the ground after pooping in order to wipe my butt.",4

"by blowing my load absolutely everywhere during a massage so this actually happened almost four years ago now and will need just a little back-story.

i visited thailand in september '15 as part of a (still on-going) trip around the world, this was via a tour group and so, to keep the budget low, we were often put into shared rooms. this meant that trying to jerk off was a little bit of a problem, and i never felt ok jerking off in shared bathrooms/showers, so i decided to just not bother for the duration of the trip. i was there for a month and this happened during week three, so you can imagine, my cajones were a little heavy by this point and my libido was getting just a tad ravenous.

one morning whilst enjoying the sporadic sun between the monsoons on koh samui, i decided to strip down to by boxer shorts and plunge into the warm ocean instead of heading back to my room and changing into my swimming shorts. after a little splash around i used the outdoor shower to wash the saltwater off and put my sweatpants on with no underwear, i didn't think much of it. i then proceeded to drink a fairly decent amount of beer and gorged myself on plates of delicious pad thai.

i suffer from ongoing back pains, so when i hit thailand i took full advantage of their cheap massage houses. now, considering how vulgar my username is, i am actually bit of a prude. i didn't want any ""rug and tug"" situations, in all honesty it just does nothing for me once i start visualising how many other dicks those hands have played around with you know? not that i'm chastising anyone who does enjoy that, its just not my cuppa tea. so, after being a little drunk and full of food i decided to go to a nearby massage parlour and to get my near-daily full-body rub down.

this wasn't one of those sleazy parlours you see dotted around everywhere, not a hint of neon lighting or blacked out windows, it was small and a tad ramshackle but was obviously a classier establishment. i went in and there was one woman working, it was otherwise entirely devoid of anyone else. i asked for the same as always, paid up in advance (in case she thought i was after anything ""extra"") and got ready. it was only when i started taking my sweatpants off that i remembered that i was free-balling, i explained to the lovely young lady my dilemma and offered to just roll up my trousers but she just handed me an extra towel and turned around whilst i awkwardly positioned myself on my stomach with a towel under me and another over my arse.

the first half of the massage went well, it was actually one of the best ones i'd had by this point, she seemed to pinpoint a lot of my knots and just went to town on them (i'm a big fan of more aggressive massages), i was in absolute bliss. then came the time for the front. look, by this point i had been massaged by young women, elderly women, flamboyantly gay men, miserable old men, lady-boys and everything in-between, in every single instance each one of them had ""awoken the beast"" to some level or another. with this massage i was at absolute full-mast. one of those ""i've not jerked off in three weeks"", my dick actually aches type of stonkers. i apologised profusely because no towel in the world was gonna hide that particular beast. she laughed and started working on my legs, i started relaxing a bit more, i imagined it was nothing she hadn't seen before (my dick is a bit overweight but not particularly long) and tried to settle back down and enjoy it. she went up the thigh and nudged by nuts with the kind of delicate touch i imagine a pixie would have, my helmet popped out from under the towel in an almost mocking manner. i went to pull the towel back up a little more but she did as well and in doing so managed to stroke just the tip of my cock.

cum fired out of my dick with such ferocity that i thought i'd broken something, a load of it shot on her hand, a lot went all over my chest but i also decided to try and sit up at the same time and another hot wad of baby batter shot itself all over the massage bed, the floor and on her forearm. all the while i'm desperately trying to apologise, mopping up my seed whilst still emptying both barrels in a confusing mixture of ecstasy and despair. mostly despair. after a short while, the fireworks were over. there was a pregnant pause, she looked neither angry or sad, just a little bewildered. i realised that i'd been using both her fresh towels to mop up my mess and was just this gollum-esque, butt-naked creature awkwardly perched on her massage bed, covered in cum and probably reeking of alcohol who up until recently had been screaming apologies in-between the occasional gasps of joy. wordlessly i put my clothes on, not making eye contact, i pulled my wallet out and gave her about 1500 baht (the massage cost 200 to put that into perspective) and slowly slunk out. i often wonder if she talks about this absolutely fucked up situation.

edit - typos  


edit 2 - after desperately trying to reply to as many of the posts as i could, i received a notification that i'd hit the front page. so, i guess its gonna take me a while longer than anticipated to get back to y'all, i still need to work too. in all honesty, i wrote up this event because i had been told i had to during one of the many times i have regaled people with it. i had spent all day yesterday just writing incredibly downbeat stuff and decided to take a break and to quickly scribble up something a little more jovial, more for myself than anything else, thinking that it would maybe make a few people chuckle and was pretty harmless, so i posted it typos and all. i did not ever expect this response, its really lifted my spirits and i am grateful beyond words. every little complement and giggle is doing more good than i think most people would realise. thank you.

"by being accidentally racist so this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.



recently ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so i thought i'd go along. 

so anyway here i am about to play my first game of chess ever. i sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (i should now mention my opponent was african american). the chess teacher says ""first rule of chess, whites go first."" 

i think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. 

so i grab a pawn and slide it forward, then i look up expecting my opponent to make his move. instead i'm met with a look of confusion and horror, i begin to hear laughter from the people watching. 

i then realize my error ""oooh you meant the pieces"" i murmur. 
the teacher nods. 

now everyone thinks i'm a massive racist.

"for sending an explicit video my ex sent to me to hurt me to her family hi aita. i am going to try to make this as brief as possible so i don't ramble.

&#x200b;

i dated em for a year and a half. during this time i confided in her some personal secrets, which i don't feel comfortable sharing even anonymously. because of these she knows that there are certain things, related to sex mostly, that i am very sensitive towards.

&#x200b;

we did not part on friendly terms after our breakup and we don't talk anymore. i broke up with her because i found out she cheated on me, and she flipped out. recently i found out that she is seeing one of my coworkers, and that he is spreading rumors about me that she told him. she basically told him bits and pieces of the personal information i shared with her when we were together and now he's spreading some of that around the office.

&#x200b;

i sent her a message telling her to stop spreading my secrets around and to leave me alone. she replied sending me explicit videos of herself having sex with my coworker because she knew it would hurt me. that was the last straw for me, and i sent the video to all of her family and friends with the message that ""this is what em sends me when i ask her to leave me alone and stop spreading rumors.""

&#x200b;

her familly is quite religious and they lost it. apparently, they pulled their financial support for her college and arent speaking with her atm. aita?

&#x200b;

tl:dr my ex sent me unsolicited sexual videos when i asked her to leave me alone. i sent them to her family. aita?

&#x200b;

edit: well this blew up. i'll try and answer some of the things i have seen asked most often here:

&#x200b;

1: i feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that i have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. to put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, i was a victim of csa for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. it led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that i struggle with to this day (i never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that i've done that i'd like to not have spread around). she has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.

&#x200b;

2: by all of her friends and family, i meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. i worded that terribly. i have not been in the best headspace as of late. sorry.

&#x200b;

3: we have not spoken since. i have no desire to speak to her ever again. my coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and i have not heard anything from him. as petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all i care. i have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. maybe i am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. i feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.

&#x200b;

4: i will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. i have the money to fight a legal case if i have to, though obviously, i would rather not.

&#x200b;

yeah. that pretty much the main things i wanted to clear up. i'll go through the thread tomorrow if i feel up to it and see if there's anything else. it's a bit of a shitshow and i'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm",3
"neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the two spaces in front of our home. after asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving all their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home. california here, getting that out of the way. and full disclosure, its not my home. the home belongs to my parents, but i house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus i love my parents and want what's best for them). i will just be saying my home or my driveway so i dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


these neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with all the memories. i thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

my parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. he has it parked in the middle so that it takes up all the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. it has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. why? i don't know. perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. all i know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

i want to also mention they have a full garage. they also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. and a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

i politely asked him to move his car when i saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. he followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. several days later i visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

i spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since i had asked him to move his car as payback. they said he's really mean and to just let it go. this did not sit right to me, so i later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. i explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

bad idea. i assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. i assumed mom would just tell 'billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. turns out he got it from mom and dad. i get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how i did not just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

i didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. my mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an fu to my mom and dad. that's also when their car got keyed

so since i made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. now the parents are retaliating too.they finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. the one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. the beater was moved so its parked on the other side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. sorry for the run-on sentence. did that all make sense? i hope so.

this has been going on for a few weeks now.

is there anything that can be done? my parent's just seem to want to let it go. not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. my parents travel a lot and my work makes it so i cant always be there to sit the house for them. they fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. i used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?


tldr - neighbors parked all their cars in front of my parents home and wont move them, only rearrange them. the neighbors go out of their way to be jerks to my parents. parents fear retaliation.",2

\-----

&#x200b;

two weeks ago we were two weeks away from getting married.

she asks me to go to therapy with her. she was already seeing a therapist on her own, and wanted me to go with her and have a talk, before the wedding, where we could be completely honest with one another. that sounded a little weird to me, i thought we were already completely honest with one another, after all, we were getting married in two weeks, right?

also, she was super protective about her therapy sessions, didn't really talk about them. i have never met her therapist. so to be invited there all of a sudden seemed a little out of place to me.

the day comes, and i go there. but out of self preservation, i had my phone opened and recording any audio.

my fiance was already there. i had to wait 20 minutes before i was invited in. the therapist greets me and shakes my hand. we have small talk. she tells me i am not at all the way my fiance described me. i think she is trying to compliment me. then she looks at my fiance and tells her ""this may be harder than we thought.""

that absolutely weirded me out. but i am a calm and collected individual, and i don't react, just kept that dumb smile on my face we all have in awkward situations.

so the therapist starts talking. has a small speech i don't care to repeat. my fiance takes my hand as the therapist starts telling me that ""we live in a modern world, and that my fiance wants us to have a non-conventional marriage moving forward.""

i smile, i am not sure what the hell that means, through my mind i am thinking she wants to talk how she will not be a slave to her husband, she will not sacrifice her work life, etc. modern woman and girl power and all that.

nope, she is actually talking about how once we get married, she wants to be free to sleep with other men.

the other non-traditional type of marriage. i forgot it's 2018.

but she loves me a lot, and would not be comfortable with me having the same ""benefits"".

because she would be too heart broken knowing that i find other women attractive and that one of them could steal me from her.

so i let them finish talking. they were very fluent, and they got more confident talking, probably empowered by my lack of reaction, and because i wasn't saying anything. this was definitely something they have rehearsed.

i then asked the therapist if she is licensed. this, by her reaction, was not what she expected to be the first thing coming out of my mouth. she said yes. so i told her to explain to my fiance why we will not be getting married any more, and why we will not continue being a couple starting immediately.

i wished them good luck, and left the office.

now, i want to report the therapist. i am not sure if i have to report her to the clinic, or is there a board that supervises therapists? i don't think their planning and attempt to corner me is professional conduct, and i want her to pay for the misconduct. that ""session"" did not sit well with me.

to be clear, there would have been no positive outcome to this talk my fiance and the therapist had with me. even if she wanted a completely open marriage, where i could sleep with other women, the outcome from my part would have been the same. that's is not a marriage, that is a sham.

it also dawns on me, she might have cheated on me. now that i have this clarity of mind, certain things don't match up.

so i was a fool anyway.

i listened to the recording, and i still can't believe what was said there.

anyway, i called off the wedding.

i am a very easy going guy, there are no fights with me because i am not seeking them. there are no conflicts, enemies, because my life is guided on principle and common sense. that might have given my ex the impression i will be easy to walk over, like a door mat, but she is an idiot for thinking that. having listened to the recording a few times, i am confident the therapist recognized i am not how my fiance must have described me in their sessions.

hence the ""this may be harder than we thought.""

now that the wedding is no longer happening, people are starting to ask questions i am not comfortable answering.

how do i navigate this sea?

i am sure my ex is doing damage control, but i have the recording, and if she goes too far off the path, i will not shy letting people know what she wanted us to talk about.

but my parents and family also want answers, and i am not sure what bs to tell them. i don't want them to think i am an idiot for allowing my ex to get to this point where she was so confident that she straight out told me she wants to fuck other dudes.

she is also blowing my phone, my best friend's phone, my brother's phone.

""we can work on this"", ""i didn't understand what they were telling me in the therapy session"", ""she will do anything to fix this"", ""it was the therapist's idea, she was against it"", etc.

last cry of a dying siren. all her cries fall on deaf ears, and i am the owner of said ears.

we were also working to get a loan to buy a house, but i cancelled everything.

i basically erased any ties we had financially, or otherwise.

her current plea is that in therapy she exposed her insecurities about our sexual history. i had considerably more partners than her, and the therapist came up with the idea we should ""level the field"".

regardless of the truth of this, that therapist gets reported once i figure out where to do it, and what to say.

this post is mostly a rant, but i would also want to know how would you handle the questions of friends and family. my ex is certainly doing her own damage control, and i don't want to be a he said / she said. i do have the recording, and am wondering if i should send it to the interested parties.

my ex doesn't know i have the recording.",8

"by trying to edit a headshot without permission, hr is involved. tl;dr at bottom.

i work in a corporate environment in the marketing department. a portion of what i do is handling the corporate website. one of our mid-level professionals (i'll call her gina) has recently published an excellent research paper that is topical, relevant and insightful. it's a pretty big deal for her professionally, and the company as a whole.

every year, we get professional headshots done to feature in corporate documents. it's one guy who does every office, and he's usually pretty good, but with 800 staff and unrealistic deadlines, he'll do colour correction, but no retouching.

so, gina's paper is being published, and i'm called on to do all the marketing around it. this includes getting professional hard copies of the document, a social media strategy and some conference speaking work.

the thing is, gina's headshot is a little... off.

as a thumbnail, it's fine, but when it's zoomed in, you can see a definite moustache. not a little ""maybe she ate a chocolate doughnut for lunch"" mo, but a lip full of whiskers that you'd expect to see on a 90 year old woman who enjoys hitting children with her walking stick.

so, i can't exactly call up and ask if i should do something about this, as it's not really a conversation i want to have, and i'm also not known as the most tactful person. i'm very familiar with photoshop, and use it all the time (i've got no graphic design qualifications though, so i'm very slow by comparison), so i go about just blending and masking her whiskers a bit. i'm zoomed right in on her mouth to clean up the zone.

i work in an open office, but not many people are in my immediate area. still, it's not something i want to embarrass her about, so any time someone walks by, i alt-tab to a different screen, or move the pic to a different area.

lo and behold, gina decides to drop by with her feedback on the printed draft that she's marked up. as she comes by, i hear her footsteps and hit the scroll wheel on the mouse. she comes in and freezes, asks what i'm doing. i say im just tweaking a picture, and when i look at my own screen, it's zoomed right in on her cleavage.

she gets louder and asks what the fuck i'm doing fixing her chest area. she then asks if i'm making her breasts bigger, or doing something shady. for some reason, i decide to avoid telling her the truth and just say i'm evening out the skin tone.

she dumps the hard copy draft and walks away.

about an hour later, i get an email from hr saying that i need to stop working on this project, and come in for an interview.  i ask if i can speak privately first, and explain the situation. i still get in a lot of trouble for fixing an image without her consent, and that gina is more than her appearance, and a suggestion that it's sexist to try and ""make her prettier"". i acknowledge that, but also mention that i tidy up all images that are going to be blown up, men and women alike, but to be honest, i'm just trying to get out of the awkwardness. 

we have the meeting, and i had to explain the whole thing to gina directly. she is adamant that she doesn't have a moustache (an to be fair, while sitting there, she doesn't. she's sorted that out in the days between the pic and this event). she then goes on to suggest that i altered the pic to add the lip hair as an excuse for staring at her chest (worth noting here, she wasn't dressed provocatively or anything, just normal corporate wear).

i then had to get the photographer to re-send the originals to the hr rep, and they indeed show her lip-bristles.

she's still livid, and hr suggest that i should jump off this project. 

i'm actually a bit concerned as to where this leaves me going forward, as she does have a bit of influence. i told my boss the whole story and he's assured me i'll be fine, in-between being sympathetic, and stifling his laughter at my misfortune.

i called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . he seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  he said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. i sat her down and we talked. all she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . i tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. i asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. she said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . so i did. she kept changing subjects or saying that "" a mother just feels it. you wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". she got very agitated and was crying telling me that if i wanted to leave her i should simply leave but i shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200b;

somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

after she did i went on her computer. i do **never** snoop on her. but i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . oh boy. she was in 2 facebook groups. one was a normal mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. in the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. they were feeding in each others delusions. a woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. my wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. so many women were making her fear that i would leave. saying things like men can not stick to a woman . many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

i was really fucking scared. i researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of schizophrenia(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3361851/). so to say the least i could not sleep. i was and am still very afraid of losing her. she woke up and i tried to act like nothing was wrong . we were going to the doctor. and it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. she was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. he was really tactful when talking to my wife. he tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. we tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. she got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . she began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . we could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . she could not breathe. the doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . she had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. did an ekg to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

at that point i really had no other option than to inquire about involuntary commit. so i could not do it myself . i needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . after that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". so far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . my wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. when i last her she was furious with me. she said i was taking away her freedom which i am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. she is so mad at me. i feel like i am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. i love her with all my heart. i am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . i feel like i failed to protect her. at this point i am just rambeling . sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . i feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : i will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! when i gave my vows i meant trough illness and bad times. i am not only on the ride for the good times. if you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? i am here to stay. i will not divorce her. she is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. i hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

sorry for the rant. but if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. i understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it beginns to mess with their mental health  and i respect that but i won't do that.

edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. she was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

i don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as i was so distraught. but i was not a sedative. i think it was something along the lines of valium or baldrian. over the counter stuff mostly.

she has family. she is estranged from most of them. her sister is now at our place to help.

also refrain from such stupid comments like ""i'll bet she will leave bro. she is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. just seems like you want me to divorce. get a life.",8

"by using my parents pc. tl;dr at the bottom.

nsfw

this is still fresh in my mind as i'm typing. i take some time out of my daily commute home from night shift to make a detour and spend time with my dad (71 years young) who spends most of the week alone as my mom (62) works all day. today was just a routine visit. my folks live in the country and don't have trash pickup so i visit with dad while driving their garbage to the dump. as we are talking i bring up a video i had seen and suggested i share it with him. he agrees and once we get back to the house he suggests i find the video while he does something else. 

commence fuckup. 
my dad has an older model desktop pc that is quite temperamental and only likes to use google chrome. i go to open a window and see that my dad has 20+ tabs open. all of them were different profiles on fetlife. for those who don't know, fetlife is like myspace for people with fetishes (bondage, waterworks, furries, etc). i just brushed it off as my dad being a dirty old man. unfortunately the tab i opened chrome to was my parents profile page. i not only saw my mother in *very* revealing garments; i also saw my dad gagged and hog tied like a pig at a pork roast. so now, not only do i know my parents are pretty kinky, i also know what it looks like when my dad is getting stuffed like a christmas turkey. 

tl;dr:
opened google chrome to share something with my dad, only to find out he gets butt-raunched by my mother on the regular.

edit2: wow my first gold! thanks stranger!!

edit 3: my wife is a reddit user and knows her husband posted this from the commute detail. she didn't believe me so she temporarily created a fetlife account so i could, for once, be right. now she is very distraught and has told me she can never look at my parents the same. what do?",4
"neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard update: i'll be sure to post updates so please stop pming me or replying to my comments/post history outside of this sub asking me to do so or suggesting i shit-bomb them back. 

my wife noted that what we think might be his kid comes around most weekends. in the interest of remaining neighborly and with the possibility neighbor dude might be losing his mind, we're going to talk with them before lawyering up or involving the fuzz. updates forthcoming.

original post:
hey all, i have a shitty situation here that i'm hoping to get some advice about. this is in idaho.

&#x200b;

my neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. a new neighbor bought a house across the street about 6 months ago. a few weeks back, i was working in the garage when i saw him take his dog directly across the street, into my front yard. he let it pee in my yard and then walked straight home. he didn't notice me  - my garage is set up as a shop and is pretty busy, and the garage door is up a lot - but this piqued my interest because it's goddamned weird. now, my wife and i have a dog so there are a few dog droppings from her that we pick up on a regular basis. my wife had been doing the dooty duty recently, so i asked her if there are more piles than normal. sure enough, she said there had been a ton for a while now. she figured it was assholes walking their dogs and letting them crap in our lawn. i figured it was our new weirdo neighbor.

&#x200b;

it happened again around a week later: i was in the garage as the neighbor took his dog into our lawn. this time the dog dropped a deuce and he started to walk away without picking it up. i called out to him, asking him if he needs a plastic bag to pick up after his dog, and he avoided eye contact and scurried back home.  i went across the street and knocked on his door. he didn't answer. we set up a security camera to discretely watch the front lawn and i kept an eye out for when he was next out in his yard so i could talk to him.

&#x200b;

i reviewed the footage over the next few days and, sure enough, he was consistently taking his dog to do the deed in our yard. why our yard? no clue, we've never had any interaction with this guy whatsoever. the next time i saw him walking to his car, i confronted him. i simply told him that i knew he was taking his dog to shit in our yard and if i caught him doing it again i'd call the police to report him for trespassing. he denied doing it, claiming it must be other neighbors, got in his car, and drove away with me standing in his driveway.

&#x200b;

so i review the footage from the last few days. dude is not walking his dog into my yard anymore: he's letting the dog shit in his yard. he then scoops it up, walks it across the street, and tosses it into my yard with a shovel. what the absolute fuck.

&#x200b;

how do i even begin handling this?",2
"if your child is obese (outside of medical reasons) it should be considered child abuse. 
imo a dr or teacher should be able to contact cps for an investigation if a (young) child is morbidly obese. 

last night i saw 2 small children, brother and sister, who looked around 5 and 8 years old who were both massively overweight. it broke my heart to see them struggling to play, breathing heavily, and see their overweight mom hand then candy bars and chips. 

i don't know their circumstances and for the most part, i am indifferent to other's choices in raising their children. however, there is no reason a child that age should be obese (aside from a medical condition). a child that age is not in control of what they are given to eat and if you as their parent are over-feeding them junk to the point of childhood obesity, some sort of child abuse should be suggested. 

these poor kids have to grow up with the consequences of your bad eating habits and you are setting them up for health problems later in life. 

edit: thank you for mentioning the factors i naively missed such as poverty, the effects of corporations targeting children, and people who don't know better. these points are very valid and make a lot of sense. perhaps if counselors, teachers, doctors had the ability to become more involved in extreme situations (as some can with underweight, starving children) this could be a good place to start. 

i had no idea this was a ""re-post"". 

as anyone, i am speaking from my own experience and i did come from a family who struggled with money. i don't know how my parents managed to keep our meals balanced. 

 i think we need positive ideas of ways we can help prevent this problem. my doctor's office has material for families about healthy eating. i have seen free ""classes"" offered in the community for families about healthy eating. 

edit 2: i remembered more of our eating habits as a child. we had a garden, my dad's friend gave him grain that we ground up in a vitamix for flour, we ate a lot of rice, beans, veggies. we also spent a lot of time outside. all in all, education is a huge influencer and effort makes a difference!

also for the love of god everyone saying this is a popular opinion should read the comments because a good portion disagree with me. yay for a lively debate!",6
"by sleeping with a married woman. so, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. nsfw or for anyone, really. and i may not be alive much longer, because i'm probably going to be murdered.

i'm at the bar the other night, watching the hall of fame game. after it's over, i go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before i uber home. this girl sitting next to me, very attractive. out of my league. like wayyy out. i'm just scrolling through memes on my phone. and she asks me 

""hey! can i trust you to watch my things and not drug me?""

 ""uhh what?""

 ""can you watch my stuff while i go pee and not drug me"" 

to which the bartender said ""oh you can trust greg, he's really nice"". annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. just random shit. showed pictures of our dogs to each other. talked about shows n stuff. typical 'meet a girl at a bar' flirting shit. she asks if i've ever seen the show years and years. i say ""no, but i've seen the band perform live"". so she goes on about how great the show is, and how i need to watch it. asks if i have hbogo. ""yes because i forgot to cancel my cable after got"". so she makes me download the app, so i could start watching it when i get home. thanks for the recommendation! i'll probably check it out never. so a few minutes later, she said

 ""hey do you live close by?"" 

""yea, like half a mile""

 ""we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. i have a bottle of whiskey in my car""

""idk, my house is kind of a mess right now""

""that's okay, i have pets too"" (or something like that. all i was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

""i mean i guess, but i have to be at work early tomorrow""

""that's okay, i can only stay 30-40 minutes and then i'll have to go home""
""that's fine"" heh, cuz that's all the time i'll need! am i right, fellas??

no. nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

it's about, 11pm at this point. i think? and mind you, i've only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

so we tab out, get in her car. which is a stick shift. and i say ""oh no shit, i like you even more now! no one drives a stick anymore! i drive one every day!"" which i'm excited about, because at this point i'm thinking to myself ""hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows i like, and imma bout to get laid""

we talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn't the first time that this subject came up). which is just a half mile away. so was a short drive. she parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

go inside, i try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. while i try to get my chromecast set up on my living room tv. ya know, to ""watch hbogo"".

she runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

it's fucking evan williams.

and this is the first time where an ""oh no"" thought crosses my mind.

kids, i've slept with some strange in my time. i don't know how or why i get myself into these situations. i honestly feel that i'm a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. sure i troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but i do genuinely care about other people. being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. but in this case, i was dead wrong.

so after some talking about random shit. we get the show playing. i couldn't even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

sex.

so after, we're just laying there. pillow talk. was a good night. i just got laid. she asked if she could stay the night. we're gonna go to sleep. everything is cool. i let her know that i have to be at work in a few hours, so i need to get some rest.

now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* right?

wrong.

i say ""that was great we should do this again sometime""

""i don't think so""

""what why?""

""i don't think my husband would appreciate that""



i am speechless. i don't think i've ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. like, how the fuck did i not see this coming. omg imma home wrecker. i'm probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

me: ""ummmmmmm what? is this an open relationship? does he know where you're at? like, why didn't you tell me that?""

her: ""idk, does it matter?""

""uh yeah, i'd be pretty pissed if i was him""


now i've been cheated on before. and that feeling sucks. i've been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. where i didn't know that i was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. i had found out a couple days later, and i found him on fb and let him know. he thanked me, and didn't get mad at me at all. cheating is the worse thing ever.

so this is where shit starts to hit the fan. i don't remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

her: ""we're getting separated soon""

me: ""well you're still fucking married to him""

""yea but that's okay""

""how is that okay?""

""he's been..... abusive""


there's a slight pause, then she starts crying. so this is where the sober me starts to kick in. this girl is struggling. she's in a bad spot. and no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. and now i'm trying to empathize with this trashy evan williams drinking bitch. like i legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

que the panic attack.

she starts going nuts. ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. knocking shit over. basically trashing my house.

she asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. which i do. she takes it. and calms down. (for the most part).

now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. i tell her that we need to go to sleep. because i have to work in the morning. she tells me ""(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy"" btw, evan williams isn't that bad when you're slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

we finally get to sleep around 4? maybe? i wake up late, she wants round 3. and who doesn't like morning sex. i'm still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. so i gave her a fuck.

anyways, i need to leave for work. but her car is blocking mine. i tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can't because she didn't know where her clothes were. and told me i couldn't move it because ""i didn't know how to drive it"" 

""uhh, this is the third time we've had this conversation. i drive a stick every day, i can move your car""

i move her car. i leave for work. and i just let her stay at my house. i let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. two, i was already running late, and fuck it she'll probably leave before i get home.

a couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. i get concerned, because i'm starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. i came to the conclusion that i should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... but, i see that she had already messaged him. from my facebook account! my computer was still logged into fb when i left, and i didn't think to log out or shut it off or anything.

i tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. he lets me go home. when i get home, i find her still naked in my bed. i get her friend to get her an uber. and i leave. oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

go back to work. thinking everything is over. that's the end of that. wrong again.

i get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. and only that shirt. like vag all out and everything. this girl is afraid to go home. which i'm worried about at this point. because i want her to go somewhere safe. she's refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

oh yea, she had me find her phone. which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. and several others from other people.

she hands me $20 to order a pizza. and after we eat the pizza, she'd uber home. fuckin bet. i ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

i kid you not. i'm sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. and she just opens her legs and says ""make it quick""

this bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and i'm just ready for her to leave.

sex.

after, we're just sitting there, and she starts crying again. asking to go home. and i'm like 

""i'll get you an uber home, but you gotta put pants on""
""no""

""what do you mean 'no'? you can't get in an uber with your pussy out""

""no""


so i gather up all of her belongings and clothes. and try to help her get dressed. to which she refused to allow me to do.

most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... that ""arch"" thing that women do when you're pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#i had the same feeling when i got her panties on.

pizza arrives. i go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. come back inside. panties are off again. god dammit.

we never even opened the pizza box. she's saying that she wants to go home. but is refusing to get dressed. i'm starting to panic myself. because i don't know how i got myself into this situation. but, am me.

she eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that's she having with her husband. and i read through the conversation, it's her sending multiple texts saying ""i'm so sorry babe"" ""idk where i'm at"" ""come get me"". and him saying ""nope sorry"" ""this is on you"" and ""call 911""

that last one though. that's what i did.

before i called 911, i offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because i knew the husband would give her a ride back there. and not to my house. because now i'm starting to worry about my safety. i don't want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. but then again she states that ""you don't know how to drive my car"" with it being a stick and all. even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

i told them that i have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. etc. i tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn't answer.

the ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. this girl is drunk crying. trying to get me to go for yet another round. where at this point, my dick hurts. also, ""girl you need to get dressed, you're gonna be going home""

finally got her panties back on, i didn't tell her that i had called the cops. i told her that the uber was coming. and was trying to get her to put her pants on.

cops show up, i go outside. explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. but i kept my calm. i told them that i was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. but they can't force her to go anywhere she didn't want to. she wanted to go home. officers ask if she was presentable. i pop my head back in the door. she's still wearing my shirt and her panties. so i'm like ""i guess?"", and then i let them in.

she yells ""are you fucking serious? you called the cops?"" 
""uh yea, you didn't wanna leave. even though you said you did. plus your husband said to call 911, so that's what i did""

the officer said to her ""you're on this man's property, and he wants you to leave""

que crying and what not.

cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. which i do. her husband calls her phone, so i accept the call, and then put it up to her face. tell her to tell him what's happening. and that she is getting an uber home. apparently her card and paypal was getting declined for the ride. so she couldn't do it herself. they live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. i live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a lyft/uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... girl finally decides to get dressed.

i had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... i could see the officer's partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. lol.

anyways, i hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she's still wearing mine) to the officer. made sure she had all of her belongings. we get her to walk out of my house to the uber. but she tried to grab the bottle of evan williams. to where i audibly laughed. ""i don't think they'll let you take that""

cops didn't let her take it. she got in the uber and she was gone. policeman handed me the bottle back. where i say ""usually this is the other way around, ha""

po-po leave, i call it a night, and it's over.

flash forward to today. i get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she's asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. i was at work at the time. so i wasn't able to check. but i'm 98% certain i handed those over to the cops. i look for them when i get home. found nothing.

oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

so that brings us to now. i haven't heard anything from her. or the husband. and i'm not sure if it's safe for me to go home. but ya. know what? fuck it. i'm glad i could share this story with y'all. there might be more to come, but you'll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

the moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

jk don't do that.

and don't stick your dick in crazy.

tldr: took a girl home who i didn't know was married. she trashed my house.

edit: i'm not gonna change ""que"" to ""cue"" because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while i deal with mine.

edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2gia

edit 3: her car is still there. can't get it towed, because it's on a public street. i'm still alive. i see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. i'll get to them when i can.

edit 4: fml. i sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. no response. bartender texted me late last night and asked if i used a condom. which many of you have asked.... and no. i didn't. the girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. so i think i may have been baby baited.

edit 5: i'm still not dead. her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor's house. i just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. so i walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it's front of their house... this woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. and she's most likely high on meth. because when i asked her ""hey do you wanna get this car that's in front of your house towed?"" she said ""no, noooo hehe"" i'm like ""yea, i'll talk to y'all tomorrow"" just wtf.

**update**

i've been texting a mutual friend of the couple. apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. i'm in the works of a tifupdate. but i'll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. i'd like to protect the privacy of those involved, but i'm just too lazy to do it right now.",4

"update if i don't go on a second date with a larger lady because she doesn't match her tinder pics? original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/axpo27/wibta_if_i_dont_go_on_a_second_date_with_a_larger/

hey again everyone. i finally have answers.

i never gave fake names to anyone so my date is now alice and her sister is gabby.

on saturday i got a facebook message from gabby. it boiled down to ""this is stupid, will you meet alice so she can properly explain?"" i try to get an explanation straight from her, but she refused and so on sunday i go to a coffee shop to figure out wtf is going on. 

she was cute, my crush was strong, but i managed to sit down with a decent poker face. she pretty much burst into tears the moment i arrived. lots of sorrys until she pulled herself together and i really nearly bolted bc i felt so awkward. 

gabby was the one to suggest alice use her pictures. alice showed me her phone and... it was a picture of her from a few months ago and she swiped through and there were more pictures, ones she said she was gonna put on tinder. all of herself... and she was bigger. 

i feel really fucking dumb. still. alice has been losing weight over this last year (down over 100 pounds!!!) and didn't have any flattering pictures bc she's continuing her diet and shredding weight off and her and her sister didn't know how to portray that on tinder without scaring everyone off. so that's why gabby suggested she use her pics bc they believe alice will look like her soon (tho she has probably several months to go before she's close if i'm being honest, not that i care. never did just thought i was being lied to).

when i sent the screenshot, she panicked and blocked me out of embarrassment/shame and it took a talking from her sis to meet me and come clean. i'm the first guy she's gone on a date with that wanted a second date so... fuck. sucks to be all those other guys i guess because i'm taking her out this weekend again. 

i'm gonna be cautious moving forward bc that was a shit ton of drama for a first date, but i don't know. maybe i'm being dumb? she's real sweet and we share the same hobbies and she's even pretty when she cries and my pa always told me that's how you know you're in it for the long haul and holy fuck i need to calm my crush down. this feels like high school again.

and that's that. just wanted to clear up the catfish fiasco since i got a good many comments and pms. thanks again for helping me set my head on straight.",3

"my school is demanding for a copy of every students car key. (ga) i found this out about two hours ago. my  high school posted the rule book along with the normal info for the  school year.

in the rule book section about driving to school, it states in bold letter; all students who drive to school using a personal vehicle must give the school a copy of the key or key fob.

after i read this i thought it was a misprint or a mistake. so i called the principal and school board, they both said that it was real and if you park on school property you must follow that rule.

about 30 minutes later i checked the school website and others were complaining  on the forums about it. they went on to post their reason, they want to be able to do random searches or drug sweeps.

i personally find this to be a invasion of privacy. what can i do to stop this?

edit: campus is the only place around to park at without paying $100 for a parking pass.

""i don't know what to do here,"" says the devil."" you're on my list, but i have no room for you.

you definitely have to stay here, so i'll tell you what i'm going to do. i've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you.

i'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. i'll even let you decide who leaves.""

donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

in it was barack obama and a large pool of water. barack kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. such was his fate in hell.

""no,"" donald said. ""i don't think so. i'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair.
i don't think i could do that all day long.""

the devil led him to the door of the next room.
in it was al gore with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks.
all he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.
""no, this is no good; i've got his problem with my shoulder.
i would be in constant agony if all i could do was break rocks all day,"" commented donald.

the devil opened a third door. through it, donald saw bill clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. bent over him was monica lewinsky, doing what she does best.


donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""yeah man, i can handle this.""


the devil smiled and said..........

""ok, monica, you're free to go.""",0
"for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson? necessary information: when my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. after a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

that was when my husband and i stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. when she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and i still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200b;

now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. he's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. my daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. since i'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. i asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. i asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. i also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200b;

he thought of asking me because i had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". i told him that no, it was not. i was 42 then and i'm 59 now, i didn't had the health issues that i do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  i would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. now he thinks i'm playing favorites and that i'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but i think i'm just being reasonable.

&#x200b;

edit: while it is nice to know that i'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". i disagree as it was not my intent and i never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. he's also very mad about being called an asshole. while he is my son, i find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. i'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",3

"my sister caused a scene at mother's day brunch because we didn't honor her as a ""cat mom"" hi guys. i am a man, 32m and i have two sisters - carly (38f) and melinda (26f). we went out to a family style restaurant for brunch and just returned home.

melinda and i are happily married, each with three children. my older sister carly never married. she had a fiance that she cheated on and he left her. that was 10 years ago and she hasn't been in a relationships longer a few months ever since. she has 4 indoor cats and also feeds a few stray cats that hand around her neighborhood.

my mom was very ecstatic because in the last year, my younger sister and i both gave her an additional grandchild. so she gave a speech.

in her speech, she thanked us all for coming and said some flowery lovey stuff and then thanked melinda and my wife for both being excellent mothers to her beautiful grandchildren.

upon hearing my mom praise my wife and my younger sister for being mothers, my sister carly butt in rudely with a loud and irked ""achem!""

she then went on a diatribe about how she is a mom just like they are, and why don't we ever wish her a happy mother's day?

i explained calmly that she isn't a mom at which point, she threw a fork at me and raised her voice in the restaurant ""i am a f*cking mom too you d*mn a**holes! just because i don't have human babies doesn't mean i'm not a f*cling mother too!""

my younger sister tried to calm her down but instead, carly just poured her third glass of white wine into a nearby potted plant, spit at the plant (wtf i know right) and then stormed out.

we thought that we be the end of it, but now she has published a manifesto on her social media calling us small minded and disrespectful and went on to explain why she feels that she is a mother. despite never getting pregnant and giving birth.

we have family and friends calling us on the phone since, asking what happened. i don't know what to tell them other than maybe my sister is showing signs of a nervous breakdown?

i tried texting carly to say ""hi"", but my text came back green (which she has an iphone so it's usually blue). does this mean she blocked me?

anyways i would appreciate any help y'all could give here :/",8
"by accidentally getting sexual with my dentist, again. i'm a 32 year old woman who can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because i'm an idiot. 

my dentist is a very nice and professional man. our first appointment was going pretty smoothly until he made some innocuous remark about us ""being strangers."" my immediate reply was ""oh, you're not a stranger! you've been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!"" i did not intend to make a sexual joke. his face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

i had my second dentist appointment today. i actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. he had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. his face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. i was a bit concerned and also confused. like how could i have embarrassed him this time? i had hardly spoken! so he keeps working in there and then i realize what the hell is happening. my dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. i had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time. 

never going back.

"update i have been paying for my entire apartment buildings water heating! and my landlord's response was: ""if you don't like it- just move out!"" here is the original post in case you are not up to date on the situation(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a05jq6/i_am_left_freezing_cold_in_my_apartment_as_i_pay/).

i have managed to uncover (for the most part) the cause of my exceptionally high hydro bills (averaging $400cad a month) in my apartment in ontario, canada.

&#x200b;

based on all of the advice i received from the original post – here's what went down after the comments got locked:

&#x200b;

**i managed to get onto my online hydro account – and discovered some very suspicious activity:**

* i noticed that each month was consistently high usage (every month i was consistently consuming around 2600 kwh. no matter the month – no matter if i was or was not using air-conditioning or heating during the month.
* i also checked the specific weeks where i was on vacation. i was not home at all and everything in the apartment was turned off- i paid around $70 for each week i was away. a total of $140 i paid when i wasn't even home for two weeks!
* furiously, i called the hydro company and asked them to look further – she told me the usage she is seeing is very unusual – it appeared as if the unit is vacant (consistently high consumption without much deviation).
* she also informed me that an inspector would be coming any day now...

**the inspector came to the apartment a few days ago, and accessed the meter (which was in the basement beneath the restaurant):**

* i was in school at this time so my boyfriend was there when the inspector came.
* the inspector noticed that the plumbing in the apartment for the hot water supply feeding each unit (possibly also the restaurant) were combined.
* the closest tank in circuit (mine) was doing all or most of the work for the entire building! feeding hot water to all the units.
* to prove this further, the hydro company closed the cold water intake to our apartment – and we were still receiving hot water! meaning the next closest tank in the circuit (our neighbor) was feeding our hot water.
* also, our hot water tank was feeding the cold water intake of the nearest hydro tank (the apartment next to us).

after emailing the landlord multiple times and waiting days for a response from him – he finally only came because now one of our neighbors was not receiving hot water. we noticed that he was in the basement doing something (probably fiddling around with the plumbing). after he left- we stopped receiving hot water ourselves. i had to shower at the neighbor's house yesterday because of this mess.

&#x200b;

**yesterday my boyfriend confronted the landlord when he came to ""see what's going on.""** *my boyfriend recorded the entire conversation in case we will eventually need it to support our case.*

* instead of getting a professional plumber to come and actually fix his mistakes. he is just poking and prodding at the hot water pipes (literally) and pretends as if he has any idea what he is doing.
* my boyfriend insisted that he get a certified plumber come and fix this massive disaster - and the landlord just complained about money and says that *we* should do it. (as if we haven't already done enough).
* the landlord was just complaining the entire time and even said ""**if you don't like it- just move out!""**

**i am almost certain that the landlord was aware of what was going on with the pluming in the building before we moved in**

* due to the fact that all the tenants before me have dealt with the same high hydro bills and have made complaints before (but they were all old and probably did not know that it was wrong, or what to do – likely my landlords favorite kind of person).
* since my boyfriend and i are having a hard time showering and washing the dishes with no hot water – we turned the hot water back on… meaning at this point we are carrying the entire load for the building again.

**my question to all of you:**

1. what do i do now?... can i trust my landlord to 'solve' this issue on his own – even though his ""plumbers"" will likely be rehired to do the work if we do?
2. what happens to all the money that quite literally went down the drain for this - and is still currently going down the drain?
3. do i need a lawyer?

thanks to all of you again – you have helped tremendously!

&#x200b;

***edit!***

* thank's to all of you who commented last night! - unfortunately the comments got locked before i could even reply to any of you! 
* i am working on contacting some lawyers now  and calling the tenant board on monday!

"update my (28f) boyfriend (29m) and his best friend (29f) are going on a week-long vacation. they uninvited me. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/copzwa/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_and_his_best_friend_29f_are/)

update, as promised.

i was really upset the day i dropped him off and he was texting me but i wasn't responding. i wasn't sure what i wanted to do, but i didn't want to do anything at all in the state i was in. i waited until the next day, and then i sent him a thought out text letting him know that i didn't feel safe or loved in the way the trip was handled and that i would be dropping his things off at his place and leaving his keys with the neighbor. he called but didn't leave any messages and then he messaged me that he didn't understand.

the rest of the week, he called and messaged me, but i couldn't bring myself to pick up or text back. on thursday, i think that he realized that i was serious, and he asked me some questions about logistical things — i told him which neighbor his key was with, etc.

when he got back and saw all his things at his place, he got pretty frantic and called and left me a long message. i was working all day, but also i still didn't want to respond. he asked me to explain because he didn't understand what was going on. the next day, i sent another text making it clear that it was over, and he got upset and sent me a bunch of texts in a row about how he didn't understand why i was throwing away everything that we built. he left me a voicemail that was really angry that said he had no idea why i was upset and that he did not accept the break-up because he had no say in it and that he wanted me to tell him the evil story that i had made up about him to his face.

i wasn't going to respond to him and i wanted to remain calm, but this upset me. so i sat down to write him this letter. it's long, so skip over if you want. i tried to call him but i started crying and told him i'd just send him an email instead. this is what it said.

""the time that we have had apart has given me some good space and time to think. i have had a chance to think about the things that are important for me in a relationship and i see that we should not be together. i am sorry that i have been asking for you to change things about your life that you shouldn't have to change at my or anyone's behest.

from the very start, this trip was made in an insanely disrespectful way in which it started out from you being given an ultimatum by your female best friend who i had never met that either she goes or i go on this trip, and you picked her. you didn't offer to have her meet me (theoretically i was your long-term partner, so this would have made a lot of sense), you didn't encourage her to find someone else to come, and you didn't consult me at all. that's enough for most people to have a deal-breaker, right there. however, i stayed.

this is a person who you have a history with that is not entirely clear to me. here is what i understand: some bad rumors got started about the two of you in which you spent an entire night out with her on an acid trip while you were dating someone else. nothing happened. the other thing i understand is that you were interested in her romantically at some, theoretically other, point and that she started dating her boyfriend and that closed the door on things for you. according to what i also understand, it took a long time for 29f's boyfriend to feel comfortable with you being around, but you apparently worked to ultimately make him feel comfortable with you after i'm not sure how long. this is the completely unknown person who shut me out of a trip that i was originally going to go on (unilateral decision). you did not tell me this was happening until i asked when the trip to hawaii would be.

you purchase tickets in another very disrespectful situation in which i have cooked dinner and have guests present, and you choose to go into my room for well over an hour to select tickets with her, and in which i repeatedly ask you to please come to dinner because you say it will just be a few more minutes each time. there is absolutely no reason for doing it at that time and in that situation, seeing as how she is in the same time zone as us and has a 9-5 job. this makes me feel sick to my stomach.

so, to make myself feel better about this whole arrangement, i tell you that i want to meet this person. on my request, we arrange a trip to go meet her and her boyfriend — a brief trip in which they are (and you explicitly agree) inexplicably cold. the first conversation that we have is one in which 29f and her boyfriend argue about how she dm'ed him while he was already in a relationship and got him to date her instead. you tell me about conversations that 29f has had with you recently in which it seems implied that there is some real instability in their long-term relationship — stuff about kids and dogs. i have a discussion in which i let you know that i see that and that it worries me. 

meanwhile, i am still wanting all of this to work out for you and for me and for her. i, at this point, am planning on being with you for the long term and see no benefit in telling you to not go on a trip with your best friend. i want it to work out. but each and every interaction surrounding this trip chips and chips and chips away at my ability to handle it: the conversations that seem to go nowhere, etc. your dad, your mom, and your grandparents are all very surprised when we tell them about this trip. it is becoming very obvious that this is a dangerous trip to make with the fragility of our relationship. 29m, we had only been together for nine months. how long did it take before 29f's boyfriend was comfortable with you hanging around? much less going on a one-on-one international tropical vacation in which he was uninvited because of your request?

we go over it with (friend) at the rock climbing gym, we go over it in the car, we go over it while we're booking our airbnb for copenhagen, we go over it when i tell you that i still feel uncomfortable and i do not feel good about the trip. talk about repeatedly saying something! although i ask for you to help me, you actually ask me instead to come up with what would make me feel better. surprisingly, i have no ideas either. 

ultimately, it appears that the original plan to meet at my place and hang out and do a game night before you two go on the trip has been canceled, and 29f will be staying at my place, but not hanging out with us at all beforehand. you attribute it to you not bringing it up with her early enough. this is apparently not something that was discussed even two nights before the trip. this upsets me. you do not know what to do. i don't blame you — at this point, it was well out of hand. i don't know what to do either. there is no good solution that i can think of besides waiting for the trip to be over. i tell you that either i have to get over it, or i have to break up with you, and that i don't want to break up with you. but my ability to get over it is rather rather rather worn down. 

she arrives at my place very late, and we wake up the next morning for me to take the two of you to the airport. after all of this lead-up, i know that you can tell how unhappy i am. i fully absolutely know you can tell how unhappy i am. you leave, and when i don't respond to your text messages, you text me to tell me that you hope i'm okay and you're going to bed. no call.

the rest of the week was rough. my text to you was met with, essentially, ""i'm sorry you feel this way."" you tell me that i'm being unfair.

there is no acknowledgment (and there still has been none) that this trip to a fucking honeymoon destination, as we have discussed before, could be a crazy and horrible thing to go through with, even with my quasi-blessing. this is not something that people in relationships have to deal with. this is not something that people in relationships do, besides 29f, i guess.

in the end, all of this is to say that i have felt serious emotional needs go seriously unmet in a way that is a deal-breaker for me.

there have been some wonderful, very positive times, but there has been an unnecessary amount of heartache and suffering for me over things that come down to what i can only assume are personal differences.

i cannot handle your relationship with 29f. and i suppose i could ask you to pick between her and me, but that's not what i want to do. i want you to have your best friend, and i want to leave. i did love you, but i am not about to fight this fight and hear you tell me that i'm crazy for not seeing how totally platonic everything is for the rest of my life.

it seems like trying to convince someone to like different food, or to have a different favorite color. i am not happy in this, and i do not want to feel these feelings any longer.

there is no need for this to be mutual. i do not need your permission to break up with you.""

he wrote me back an apologetic email in which he accepted responsibility for most things without any argument, except he denied anything that had to do with his relationship with her making me feel uncomfortable and he denied that i would not be able to handle their relationship.

he said that the only thing that made their trip bad for me was my own perspective.

i wrote him back that trust has to be built and that he put too much strain too early on a relationship in which we had not developed that trust.

he agreed and apologized. for me, it ended on a pretty amicable note, but this style of relationship really doesn't work for me and i don't feel like his responses to me really healed or changed anything significantly. i stand by my decision at this point.

tldr: we broke up.",8
"my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my gf was raped. it was done in a park. she didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. i couldn't force her, so i just stayed with her.

she was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and i've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. we went to therapy, and she knows i'm there for her. she has a history of depression, and i've been really worried.

last week, we found out she was pregnant. i was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. so the baby definitely isn't mine. she is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

so we had a discussion. she is a devout catholic. we initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

i flat out told her that i would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. she cried and begged me not to leave. i told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and i leave, or she aborts the baby and i stay. i would not let this go.

she didn't want either of those things to happen, so i told her we were done...

"""you can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea.  let me preface this by saying i do believe in being grateful for what you have. but there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. i hate this for several reasons.

1. the people who say this almost never have it worse. they are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. i have a disability that limits my ability to walk. i don't complain about it much but i've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. i'm aware of that, but i've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. by the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. complaining solves problems. now, i can't speak for everyone with a disability, but i personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. in fact, i'm probably the best person you can complain to. i've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and i grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, i might be able to help. 

4. also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. so even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. look it up.

5. those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if i do it right. after all, isn't that what protesting is? complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. it's used to silence people who need help. i don't think i need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. it's human nature to complain. it just is. 

just something i had to get off my chest, thanks.

"by hoarding my grandparents' pension and starving them. my grandparents don't earn much and are living hand to mouth. they don't go out much from their house. so i help them in their routine chores like paying bills, going to atms etc.  i'm also incharge of collecting their pension. 

few days back, my granddad gave me the undertaking required to collect the pension. it usually takes an hour but that day it took 3. i also had somethings to attend to. so, when i was done, i realised that it was late. i came back to my place (we live separately) and figured that i'll return his pension the next day. 

the next few days were so hectic that i completely forgot about his pension. i usually keep two wallets, one has all the cash (which i keep at home and has the pension) and the other one has only cards. i use the latter one more. after 5 days, i was in need of some cash. so i opened my other wallet and realized that his pension was still sitting there. 

i was horrified and then some guilt came and then a little more. i was so ashamed that i ran to their house. i knew that they'd be angry so i bought some groceries as a compensation. as soon as my granddad opened the door,  i started apologizing. he kept smiling during my apology and forgave me as soon as i was done. i handed over the pension and went to keep the groceries in the fridge.

well my guilt was gone and i was again my normal miserable self. i opened the fridge to put the groceries in, and it was literally empty except a few ice trays there was nothing. my guilt came running back to me, i walked in the kitchen and there was just a half cut loaf of bread. i knew i was the cause of this. 

i asked them about it and they told me how they knew i was busy and thought that i'd turn up when i have the time. they didn't even try calling me because of the same reason. i had never been more ashamed in my life.  my one mistake pushed them towards starvation. 

they already had a really hard life. they had been abandoned by their children, who took all their money. first their children stopped caring then somewhere down the line, they did too. and i guess that's why they've stopped asking for anything from anyone. it's really hard to watch and still, they keep smiling with their saddened eyes. i guess when you get old, you stop expecting from life anymore. 

tl;dr: forgot to give my grandpa's pension back due to my busy schedule. they didn't have enough money to buy groceries and had to survive on a loaf of bread.

edit4: guys i'd like to give you some context. there are so many valuable suggestions but i'd like to mention that i live in india. there are not many services available related to elderly. even the normal food delivery services are scarce.
also i've tried many things but my grandparents are very unlucky. they were doing well until 4 years ago, when my grandpa lost his eyesight due to his diabetes and cataract. he now can only see from one eye having only 1/8th vision and is advised to not to read or write. he used to handle all the finances but now he is unable to do anything.
my grandma is not literate. she dropped out of school in early years and couldn't read or write much. so she can't access any services. she just does the household chores. 
that's why i've been helping them. 
even after all this, they don't let me pay for anything. even a simple thing like electric bill payment is reimbursed to me. it's really unfortunate what happened with them but they don't show it even a bit. they're a proud couple and i really love them a lot.",4

"update: today i came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from delaware, usa

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d9t0ez/today_i_came_home_to_a_new_fence_in_my_backyard/)

i found the fence on thursday. saturday i was having about a dozen people over for a family birthday party so the eyesore of a fence had to go, one way or another. so on friday morning, i had a follow-up call with the realtor who knew nothing about the fence, and he told me that the homeowner didn't either. i called my neighborhood civil council president to let him know about it, and he told me about encroachment issues (as the fence was on my property), but also let me know that in my city, a permit is not required to build this type of fence.

i took many commenters' advice and installed security cameras around my house, two of which have either full or partial view of the neighboring backyard.

i also took to heart the idea that there may be squatters living or preparing to live in the house next door. if i find anything on my security cameras indicating there may be squatters, i'll be informing the police.

so, on friday afternoon, i removed the fencing in its multiple different pieces and gently leaned them against the brick garage, with the exception of one door-sized section, which i put against the basement door in case there are indeed squatters entering through there. saturday, sunday, and monday came and went without any indication that the yard was entered again, and the fencing over the basement door hasn't moved.

we still don't know who built the fence or why, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares, and at least now i don't have an abomination of a fence to stare at anymore. i will likely build my own fence though, one that looks good and is structurally sound, and that spans my property line.

thanks to everyone for your input and advice, and if i learn who built the fence i will be sure to update again!",2

"update: my ex husband and his new wife made my daughter a back brace out of wood and steel and forced her to wear it (florida) **edit:** forgot to add this...my first post was here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4a97dq/my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my_daughter_a/

firstly i would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive pm's i received. it was really overwhelming (in a good way). a few people asked for an update so here it is.

so a lot has happened since i first posted. i called in to work while i was trying to get all this sorted. one of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. my husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. my daughter went to physiotherapy. eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. i was against it but the court ruled against me.

i gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. on her second visit it happened again. this time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. the next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. the neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. they had to cut the brace off my daughter. my husband and his wife were arrested. they got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with cps. my ex lost visitation and custody and i'm working on making it permanent. unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. it set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. she needed surgery and is still recovering. she always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. i hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. right now i'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. that's my update.",2
"there were better female-empowering shows and movies 20 years ago than there are today. this came up while discussing movies with my sister. i asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry. she said something like ""i'm not sure if they got the roles cuz they're good and female or just because of the latter"" and it really opened my eyes. 

the current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like wonder woman being exceptions). i found terminator, power rangers, castle, etc. way cooler when they made them equals with men and not simply trash them. also, wasn't it more inspiring when women made it big back then? i remember when the chess player judith polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. now, with a separate chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. but i'm digressing.

power rangers vs the new ghostbusters is my point. females were part of the original pr team in almost equal numbers. they usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. that. was. awesome. the new ghostbusters isn't. 

now i'm just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

edit: to answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, i'm not making this up. women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. although this was challenged by judit and now by hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn't getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.",6

shortly after we'd left, someone in the building called 911 because their son was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion (he's fine now btw). the firefighters were curious as to why the power was off. long story short, after the kid was safe they had a nice talk with the landlord about endangering a child's life to save some money, and she was asked to turn the power back on.

"american colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path. according to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. in america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


in those 8 years of school, i must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. there are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and i hate using this term) a sheep. to my understanding, american colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (not 100% sure on that) so, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of stem field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90°, not 45°, not even 1°.


edit: ok, i understand and agree that philosophy is important. however, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. i just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. hell, my school has bio ethics, i haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. 
 

it honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.",6

"wa my father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). my step sisters father, who has previously never cared about her, is getting full custody and has told me he won't allow me to visit. is there anything i can do? hi, so my life is falling apart.

as the title says, a few weeks ago my father and my step mother were killed in a car accident. they have been married for 7 years, and my step mother had a daughter from a previous marriage who is 8 years old. i love her unconditionally as if she were my own sister and i would fight tooth and nail to keep her safe.

she has no immediate family other than her father in the area, so he is going to receive full custody of her. i don't know if subjective opinions are allowed in posts like this, but this guy is a fucking asshole. the reason my step mother left him is because he was abusive (which was never reported to the police, but i know several people who have witnessed it first hand, so it absolutely 100% happened), and the reason he was abusive was because my step sister was born and he didn't want a child. as a result, he has never given a shit about her, never asked to see her, and has never wanted anything to do with her until now.

i was at home with my step sister a few days ago and he knocked on the door. i opened it and we had a really ugly conversation about what was going to happen to my step sister now that her mother and my father were dead. i told him that if he did end up having custody i would want to be seeing her as often as possible as i consider her my family. he told me, verbatim ""that's not gonna happen, son. i don't want my daughter spending time with half caste blood."" (he's referring to the fact that my father is mixed race, and that i am too as a result. i slammed the door. i was absolutely livid, which brings me to this post.

so basically, i have a few questions:first, can anything be done to stop him having custody? there are no police reports about his abuse, and his criminal record is clean by all the research i have completed.

third, at the very least, could i contend in a court that i have visiting rights to her? i'm not actually related to her, so i'm not sure what the standing is there.

third, if it's not possible to force allowed visits, is there anyway i can straight up adopt my step sister? i have an office job that pays well, so financial security wouldn't be a problem, i have an apartment of my own, and i would be 100% willing to be her full time guardian.

**edit: i want to make it absolutely clear that my sister does not want to live with her dad, and she says she wants to live with me.**

"for pointing out to my friends that they are not famous? my friends are dating, they're also actors who have had small roles on a few tv shows (i'm talking two lines or less). i say this not to be a hater, i truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they've got under 1500 followers combined). 

anyway last week i posted a group picture on instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other's shoulders. very platonic. 

anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don't want ""the public"" to know they are dating. i would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don't. also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. 

anyway i asked what they meant, and they said they didn't want to end up in gossip rags....

i pointed out that they are not famous and that they don't even have functioning imdb pages. they were livid and called me a bunch of names. 

i think they're delusional but they've been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). at this point, i don't even want to be their friend. however, and probably because i'm an asshole, i don't want to delete it based solely on principle.

"my ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), i was starting to heal until i found out the reasons why he ghosted. the past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. i'm not sure if i'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

my ex, 'tom', and i had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so i thought. we had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). i was happy, and i thought he was too. we had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, i could go on. 

everything was fine until our last trip together. we went to a destination where i had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something i'd have to wait longer to do. it was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

after we landed (the last time i saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. i didn't think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. i tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn't respond. i started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. from there our communication basically broke down. i can't say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn't remove me from any social media. from that point i'd try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn't respond. after about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then i wouldn't hear from him for several more days. what hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with new years, valentine's day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn't even wish me a happy whatever. 

i felt like i was going crazy. i had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  i was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. i stopped going out as much, and didn't really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. i found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse i could think of whenever i showed up somewhere without him. 

i eventually broke down, i contacted one of his good friends who i felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. i told her that tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he's only sent me a few text messages and i have no idea what's going on. i told her i didn't know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that i needed to know about. she looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and i that i was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. this was soul crushing to hear and i felt humiliated and worthless. i told her this wasn't the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. she said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

throughout march and april i felt like i was starting to heal some. i felt broken, but i started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. i told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. then i found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

he had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. not sure how long, but a little less than a year. i'm also hurt because i know the person he cheated on me with. she's an absolute garbage person. and i'm not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. she has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. i've heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the lgbt community and non-christians. she is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn't need it. she somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government's eyes. i think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, i'm really not sure. i can't really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. i've always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can't help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. her parents have paid for her car and i think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. she spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and i frequent and will interject herself into our outings. she has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew i wouldn't approve. then he started to get high and then have sex with her. he felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn't enough for him to stop getting high with her. his intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. this woman hated my guts, and kept pushing tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. he didn't want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. so she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. he came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

i only found out about this, because the same friend i had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that i deserved to know the truth in case he isn't forward with what happened. 

1. there is no way in hell that i'd get back together with tom
2. i can't help but feel like absolute dog shit that tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and i'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

i don't know what to do at this point. i'm dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. i don't know if i could contain my urge to slap him, or if i would just break down and sob. i was doing well from moving on from him. i was starting to feel happy again. now, i think i'm back at square 1. i'm depressed and stressed out. 

is there anything i can do? i kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over.",8

i went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. 

he mother was screaming into the phone ""you tell him fuck you! you can say that! i say its ok for you to tell your father fuck you!!""

i took the phone from my daughter and i said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

she yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn't true at all. 

i asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. my ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

i handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear ""daddy is going to leave the room now, please don't stay on the phone long, it's way past your bedtime."" (bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was saturday night so i bent the bedtime a bit). 

i had to get my stepson to bed (he's a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

i walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she's repeating ""i'm sorry"" into the phone. i fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

i walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

it wasn't until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. she had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

i sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. she was really upset and wouldn't speak much. i hugged her. my daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. 

i'm sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. divorce is hard enough on children, and i think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be. 

what can i do?",2
"if the father of your child is still active in their life and paying child support, you're not a single mother, you're a single woman. i think people make a big deal about how hard it is to be a single parent when they have joint custody, their ex wants to be in their child's life, and they receive  child support and/or alimony, even though the only thing that's different between them and me is that someone sleeps in my bed at night.

eta: i didn't think this would get so much response. but since everyone is in my inbox making assumptions, let me clarify and say that a really quick internet search would have shown you i'm a 30 year old white married woman with kids 🤷🏻‍♀️ not a bitter dude who pays child support. calm down.

"i (33 f) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 m) and i are indian. he thinks i've cheated, i did not. t/l/d/r

i (33 f) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 m) and i are indian. he thinks i've cheated, meanwhile i'm worried i was raped. i haven't talked to my husband since he left the hospital and i don't know what to do

throwaway because who wants this disaster on their mane account?

a little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)

we've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.

we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.

things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. so when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.

i'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. at first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.

i can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! he stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.

its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and i'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think i'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.

i haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? i'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?

what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.

what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? will i have to quit?

i dont even know what any of you can do but i feel like i'm drowning.

update: i'm still reading through all the responses, thank you so much. i had no idea i would get so much help and answers.

i've decided i'm going to send my husband this post, and ask for a paternity test. i'm hoping what you've said will convince him to come back to me. 

many asking for updates, i'll try and come back when the test does. ",8

"for being honest with my nephew about where i was for most of his life? okay, let me just get right into this. i 27m was kicked out at 16 because my older sister 37f outed me to my parents as gay. they completely cut off all contact with me and i didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. when i was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. for the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

a couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and i ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. he asked me why i wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. i asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. i told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until i eventually confessed i was cut off for being gay. he made a face and asked how my parents even found out. i told him i was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that i don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. he got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

i got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that i'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". i explained to her that i didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and i think he's old enough to deserve honesty. she just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. i'm crushed because obviously i love the kid. did i do the wrong thing? should i have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",3

sorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.

nothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. regardless, i think i will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.

my sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and i have her support.

i promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now i need to support my grandma.

thank you again to everyone.

update:

sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but i chickened out half way through what i had to say :(

the good news is that i am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

thank you for all your support, everyone, i will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

my grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

i will let you know how i manage.

thank you again.

\-

pretty much the title. i have no idea how to process all this, and i am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

both my older brother and sister went to the same college. my brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. both had their college paid by our dad. dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

my brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

my sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

i got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. i always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

instead i was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how i am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. he said it was never is place to say anything since i am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

apparently my grandparents know i am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

my siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as i am because there was never a hint of anything being off. i might be naive, but i always thought i had a great relationship with my dad. we go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when i had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. i never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. i mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. it's a story he tells from time to time. he likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

my mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

i feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. i am not even sure i will be able to go to college any more, i always assumed my parents will pay for it. i never had a job, and i am not sure what job i can even get to support me through college, i have no idea how to apply for loans.

all my mom has done is cry and apologize. but nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

i don't even know if i am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, i feel shame leaving my room, and if i will be asked to move out i don't know where to go. i don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

i am angry at my mom, i am confused about where i stand with my dad. there's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. i feel rejected and i have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

anyone have any idea what to do here?

do i apologize to my dad? what do i say to him?

idk, i've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. i have no idea what to do.

"by losing a butt plug nsfw this happened about 20 min ago.

so last night my girlfriend and i decided to go out to the bars. got very drunk and stumbled back to my place and starting doing the deed. recently, we decided to be adventurous and invested in some butt plugs for her. well last night was the first time we decided to use them. we read online that using lube makes putting the plugs in easier, so that we did. everything went well but afterwards we couldn't find the plug. this is where the begins. 

we figured the butt plug must have just fallen out or something so we went to sleep and we would find it in the morning. woke up hungover and went to get food, entirely forgetting about the plug. gfs stomach has been hurting so we just figured she's a little extra hungover no big deal. we arrive at mcds to get some greasy hangover food. i order while gf heads to the bathroom to hopefully resolve her stomach issue. as i take our order back to our table, gf walks over in a panic saying we need to leave now.

she found the butt plug. in our drunken state, we managed to put the entire thing in her ass. handle and all. and now it's sitting at the bottom of a mcdonalds toilet in all its glory. 

tl;dr: did not use a butt plug as directed.",4
"by masturbating in front of my entire family this happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which i was extremely anxious about. all together, i was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager i am, i often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

so, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, i lay down in my living room with my family, watching tv. i dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since i had done next to no study at the time). 

not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, i decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

and so off i went. except i forgot one thing.

i was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that i was not in fact sitting with my family by our tv, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

i don't really understand how or why it happened. a few seconds in and i began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

i snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment i put myself in. 

i'm not going to talk about what happened next, as i don't want to relive the next few moments.

my father is just disappointed. he hasn't talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

my mother believes that we should ""embrace my sexuality"", and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as i write this. 

and i'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it's a good excuse to be alone. i find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe i was just dreaming while i was gassed up. 

but it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

tl:dr returned from dentist gassed up, beat my meat while in front of my whole family, i now live in shame.",4

"by flashing my breasts...not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam for a new job. i've been in the very early stages of interviewing at this company for about three weeks now. ""early stages"" feels like i joke because i've had at least three interviews with their recruiter so far.

as part of the hiring process for company x, you have to meet with the recruiter, take a personality test, take a logical reasoning test, interview with the hiring manager, complete a case study, present to a panel, and then individually interview with the whole team. it's a lot. i also think this it's a bit ridiculous, but i *really* hate my job. what can you do?

anyway, i pass the early interview parts with my recruiter, and he informs me i'm ready for the next step: the personality and logical reasoning tests. to ensure i'm not cheating on these tests, and because they don't want me to come in for a proctored test, i have to use their software to record myself taking the exam from my computer's camera.

now, when i'm not spending my time applying for new jobs, i'm working from home for my current job. because i wfh, i'm not always the most presentable. we're talking sweats 100% of the time and showers only 45% of the time. i look bummy. i'm a bummy girl who works from home. to be clear though, i'm not unhygienic or filthy, just bummy.

anyway. i didn't take this into consideration when i opened up my computer for these tests. i *really* didn't take it into consideration when i opened up the program to begin the tests. i only took it into consideration when staring back at me on the screen was my greasy, messy bun and  my four-sizes-too-big, holey sweatshirt.

and then...because apparently i have no shame??? i decided to watch myself *sniff* the neck of my sweatshirt to even see if it's clean (it wasn't). this was a super sobering moment, guys.

i really wanted to put on a semi-good impression here. so, i stood up from my workspace (aka my bed) to make myself a little more presentable. while getting up, i haphazardly moved my computer (which had been on my lap) off to the side with the screen facing the open part of my room. i took off my super-holey sweatshirt to put on something a little nicer. that's when i realized i wasn't wearing a bra (why would i be. i'm wfh, remember?), and the shirt i'd planned to quickly throw on wouldn't work without one. i started rummaging around in my dresser for a bra. i pull one out, put it on. dig through my closet for that single shirt i was looking for. find it, put it on. bam. ready.

i flopped back down on my bed to take the exam (looking at least 67% better). getting myself all situated, i went to push record to start the exam.

there was no record button.

instead, there was a red ""light"" in the corner and a timer counting up. it read something like 00:09:04.

it had been recording the entire time. the whole time.

me cringing at my reflection? recorded. me smelling my sweatshirt? recorded. me dickin' around my room with my titties out? *recorded.*

i had been topless for a solid six minutes of that 00:09:04 time. for an eternally-long six minutes, my titties had been out, flopping around, being recorded.

i can *only* imagine what my face looked like on that camera when i realized. i definitely whisper-spoke  ""*fuck,""* and stared at the red little light for a while. maybe a blacked out? i don't know. what i did know in that moment, was that i was royally fucked. the recorded video submitted when you closed the window. there was nothing i could do.

and then...because i'm a dumbass, guys. i went ahead and *finished* the tests and submitted it all.

so. that's it. there you have it. i might now have nudes on the internet. i might get my recruiter fired for nsfw videos. or, who knows? i might get the job.

tl;dr by not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam while changing clothes. i may have exposed my breasts to my recruiter and perhaps an entire hr department.

"a pigeon just laid an egg on my fucking bed and is always coming inside my room. so really quick background on this, i live in my apartment in an 11th-floor room and hence we have rooms with a small balcony on the corner. so there are this two pigeons (a couple i assume) and they are always sneaking into my room and then sits on the bed. i thought they were like dumb and would scatter them away. so some days later, i found a twig in my bed. and then is when i realized that these birds want to fucking make a nest in my bed. so i then threw away the stick and shut the windows and the balcony to restrict them.

so things were kinda okay but then after coming home, i found that i forgot to close the windows and one of them came inside and is comfortably sitting on my bed. and also my bed was like full of clothes, 'cause i was too lazy to sort them out. i scared the pigeon away, but then i found an egg in my bed. it fucking laid an egg. why are these birds so dumbasses? man, also i live in an area with nature and trees around it and out of all those wonderful places, you had to pick my bed. i didn't throw the egg away or anything, that was morally wrong as i thought.  so i put out a pan with a rag on top of it and the placed the egg on it and kept it in the balcony.  but the bird is not coming to it and is again trying to sneak in the room. i placed the egg literally next to their sight and still, the mama bird ain't even sitting on top of it? so what am i gonna do? will the egg not hatch if this goes on?

so is there any problem that if i touch the egg, the birb won't accept it or shit?

edit; these things happened in a span of three weeks btw, so it first came to my room in the first week, i found a twig during the second week, and the egg in the end of the third week (just yesterday)

***edit*** \#4: idk if anyone is here, but the bird laid two eggs as expected. so when i found the bird and the egg on my bed, i think it was gonna lay another egg but i scattered it away. and quick facts on pigeons on the way;

* sometimes the mama and the papa bird may share the time sitting on the eggs
* most often they egg two eggs, but not simultaneously (yeah i thought they laid two at the same time)
* and as u/kelekona said, they mostly nest in cliffs most often, so i'm guessing the apartment looked like a cliff to it? man these birbs",7
"update-i need more help. my ex deleted my ba thesis and it's due in 7 days i need additional help. based on the advice from my last thread i took my laptop to the geek squad to recover the files. they said i'd have it back by the end of the week. that would leave me with enough time to finish the last section of my thesis paper. 

i got a call yesterday that it would actually take 2 weeks because they had to ship my laptop out for data recovery. tried to explain that was unacceptable but nothing could be done about it. 

i'm not looking for technical advice. i need legal advice that i can use for my college and ex. my advisor said he can't give me an extension, which means i won't graduate next month and very likely could just fail out. is there any legal basis for forcing my school to give me an extension? my paper and all of my qualitative data was deleted. plus my backups were deleted. this whole situation is beyond my control. 

is there any action i can take against my ex?

this is my original post(https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b856m5/my_ex_deleted_my_ba_thesis_and_underlying/). basically, my roommates and i had a party on sunday. my ex showed up which is not unusual because we were on good terms and her friends are friends with my roommates. my computer was available for people to play their own playlists. again, nothing unusual. i woke up on monday and discovered all my emails were deleted (which is where i made weekly backups of my thesis). when i checked my hard drive, the folder with my thesis was deleted too. i freaked out, asked reddit for advice and took my computer to the geek squad. 

texted my ex later on monday asking if she deleted my thesis and didn't hear back. her friend called me in tears saying my ex deleted everything and feels incredibly sorry and guilty. she did it because she saw me flirting with someone at the party and got jealous. 

i have a fellowship lined up after graduation that i'm not eligible for if i don't actually graduate. i need an extension until i get my files back. i'm completely completely screwed if i can't turn in my thesis. ",2
"by saying the worst possible thing in a restaurant this happened a few hours ago in a busy buffet restaurant in a hotel in austria.

being a buffet restaurant, people were pretty much always wandering from table to food and back again, so there was a constant steam of mainly austrian and german people passing our table. we've been here a few days, you start to recognise people and my two young sons have made a few friends.

i was joking with the kids  that i'd left their nintendo switch at home, they suspected i was joking but went along with it anyway. so when i told them i had brought it they wanted to check.

""i brought it,"" i said 

""our switch?""

""yes, our switch""

""what?!! our switch?!""

""yes!! our switch!!""

they got louder and we started just repeating it, laughing. i noticed my wife frowning at me, or past me, it didn't really register.

""our switch?""

""our switch! ha!""

then my wife really started signalling to me to shut up - i was like ""it's ok... it's a buffet""

""our switch! ha!""

""our switch!""

then my wife leaned in and urgently whispered ""it sounds like you are all shouting auschwitz""

my whole body went cold with the realisation.

needless to say i immediately stopped, placed my hand on my eldest son's knee and he - seeing the look on my face-  stopped straight away - the 3 year old did one final shout before i could stop him... 

i have avoided eye contact with all other hotel guests since. 

tldr: shouted ""auschwitz"" loudly, happily, repeatedly,  in a restaurant full of germans and austrians. i'm really sorry.

edit: thank you for the gold and silver kind strangers! my first. to those calling bs: i wish it was. to the genial germans and austrians assuring me of the reduced risk of horror due to pronunciation, sincere thanks - i will sleep better tonight because of you. and for the few offended at us shouting in a buffet: it's a kinderhotel. kind of like if michael bay did buffets.

edit2: just to all my salty comrades telling me i'm a ""scum cunt"", that my kids will grow up to assholes because we were loud. i fucking love you reddit! i'm reassured that you are all so considerate when it comes to noise in public spaces. you wouldn't like this restaurant ... stone walls, stone floors, a hotel designed for kids. it's like a school playground where they've all been given metal objects to smash together but louder. our risky exchange was lost in the cacophony to anyone who wasn't walking past our table..",4

"update this man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, i have a specific question regarding something i want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it. i would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). sorry for not updating you right away as i was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

so here's what happened. i liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone's day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. so i hired a guy which i'll call him frank.

after waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid's drone and frank's drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

a few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom i recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. we went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. shockingly he was completely understanding. he told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both frank and i a settlement if i agree not to sue. i called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed frank for his drone plus way more money that i would've ever paid him. he also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that i wont pursue any legal action.

it was a happy ending and i was quite shocked of his father's reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but i must admit that i feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. never have i felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. while we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! so the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like ""mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and i'll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away"".",2

maybe she just wants to warn a guy before wasting their time with meeting up somewhere, or stop them from getting their hopes up. i get that too. 

however, if a man were to say  ""sorry, no (blank)  women"", they would get accused of body shaming and everyone would lose their shit. 

it's a double standard, and its absolute bullshit. whereas someone would say of the woman ""oh, she's just very selective and knows what she wants"", they would say of the man ""what a pig! how dare he!"". no one would ever say ""he's just very selective and wants to find the perfect soul mate"".

"i'm so tired of reddit's uncontrollable need to be the funny man in the comments no matter how serious the post may be. people on reddit have always had a great sense of humor to me, but sometimes the impulse to insert a joke or a pun or a series of weird strung along comments gets. fucking. old. 

sometimes the worst part about it is that it's so damn funny. and you just have to give credit where credits due. but lately i've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. sometimes i feel like i should laugh at the cleverness of some. but it happens so often and in so many posts that i find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. not unless there's just a golden moment. i've even begun to roll my eyes the moment i open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. i never roll my eyes. at anything. 

i used to really connect to reddits sense of humor but lately i've been really turned off by it. maybe i just need a break.


edit: thank you for the gold and silver!  wow. this blew up... i just wanna add something to this. i'm not saying it's bad to have some fun in the comments. one of you pointed out that it's okay to be serious and to have fun. i agree. i'm saying that when i'm intrigued by a post sometimes i really want to see what the reddit community has to say about it... or to see if there's additional information in the comments. but a lot of the time all i see for miles is the repetitive back and forth joking. sometimes i really just wish the top comments had less to do with clever jokes and more to do with the content of that post...

i was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. my aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. i explained why exactly i didn't feel good about giving her leyla's social security number. they both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn't see anything wrong with it.

after explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn't have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. we ended up working out a compromise - my wife and i opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. everything seemed to have worked out well.

yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from romania. she had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. she said it completely justified my hesitation. her information was stolen in the equifax breach a couple of years ago.

"lpt request : do not request one hour dry cleaning if you can help it. as a dry cleaner, i can tell you that it take an average of 1 1/2 hours for a proper dry cleaning cycle to complete: a double bath (rinse and cleaning with detergent) and a drying cycle. if a dry cleaner is offering an hour service, something was skipped. 
it take an average of 110 seconds to press a pair of pants, so take that into consideration too. that is if all the stains came out on the first try. most likely, they need to be spot treated on the spotting board by a professional spotter to remove some stubborn stains. and that may or may not need to be cleaned again with pre-spot spray treatments to get that last stain out.
usually, a dry cleaner who offers  an hour service have to shorten the washing cycle and skip pressing the clothes and just steam them while on a hanger to get them out on time. they have to also make time for tagging, bagging and racking and inputting the order into a computer or some system for pickups.
in summary, dry cleaning itself needs to be done in 45 minutes (2-3 min rinse and 35 mins for drying and the rest for extraction spinning and cool down) and the rest for processing if the staff is on top of things.
before, it was possible cause perc was a strong enough chemical to wash like water, but most dry cleaners have switched over to an alternative dry cleaning solvents away from perc by now, especially in california. 
so if you want your money's worth, do not ask for an hour of dry cleaning. (i've been in the business for 16 years. )",9

"update me / ca my teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer. well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. christ.

yesterday afternoon, after i made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), i called her gynecologist. (i have uterine issues so i got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.) 

she was very understanding, and offered to stay late if i wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. so, i called the police, let them know i was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.

my daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when i explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention. 

the doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the sti tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. though i know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, i'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.

after the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. he sat down with my daughter in our living room, while i hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear i'd hear it.)

the detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in maine i needed to speak to. i made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. he left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. he also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family. 

after he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that i make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. i told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up. 

this morning, i got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. his assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in ca, the custody arrangement is in ca, and it will be amended in ca (since ca is her state of residency), and in ca they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. he also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she had to go visit her father, much less in this situation. 

i have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that i could help her as needed. right now she's mostly been playing world of warcraft and eating junk food, but i feel like at least right now i'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.

i want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. i will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state.",2

"for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning a car and making other contestants lose? this is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

i live on an obscure little island near the uk. we have a local quiz show that's aired on the telly that i appeared on a few years ago. 

the premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. i sailed through a lot of the physical part because i wasn't a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so i was ok there.

as for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box 'room' filled with something you're terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

i thought of a believable lie before i entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and i put down all the things i'm *not* scared of. i listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. i literally couldn't care less about any of these creatures. i grew up in rural landscape and i've had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it's not an issue. my actual fear is a bit more obscure and i really honestly knew i'd fail if i was put in a room with it. 

when i entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* i was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross i can't lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

i did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. the rest of the contestants failed.

now, i won a pretty average car which i didn't particularly want, so as soon as i legally could i sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

i told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think i cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

i'm obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",3
"update: for shutting down all black names because i think it'll make my son's life harder? https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/

i posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and i were having with our baby's name. we had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. my husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black american culture. i wanted a more neutral name since i am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. we found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. his name will be....

miles trayvon

we thought it was a perfect compromise. my husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be ""tray"" to most of them. when he's in school his name will just be listed as miles (last name). he can officially be miles t. (last name) if he doesn't want to use trayvon but he can also easily go by trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. this option gives him the choice, which my husband and i agreed was important. my husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. he talked about how in 8 mile eminem's character says something like, ""this guy's a gangsta? his real name is clarence."" that's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. he's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.

i had the opposite experience. my mom is white and my dad is black. they decided on a stereotypical black name and i think it made my life harder. professional i go by a nickname and i do personally as well. when talking about it with my husband i realized it started early. i remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. a woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma i was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. instead of saying my real name my grandma said, ""her name is daisy."" i attended an hbcu and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. for example, raquan smith would put ""ray smith"", demarcus jones would put ""marcus jones"", keshawnda nelson would put ""shawna nelson"", etc. they said you had to play within the system and i did that.

anyway, sorry for the long update. i just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. we didn't really get deep into it until after i posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. before anyone says it, i do realize some people will connect trayvon to trayvon martin. that's not why we are using it. i posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but i don't mean to offend anyone. it's a family name on my husband's side.

"by trusting some rando on airbnb shit river 2k19

we have a thousand words to explain all that transpired with our dear friend paul from august 3rd to august 4th, 2019. let me spin you a tale...a tale of shit river.

4:30 pm

our initial impressions of the house were terrific! our illustrious host, paul, left a bottle of red for us on the table along with some chocolates and popcorn. paul was friendly! check-in was quick and easy so our party settled in. everything was looking great!

6:00 pm

we return from purchasing perishables for the weekend. we fill the fridge as we prepare for a relaxing and restorative vacation. we had all traveled far and been looking forward to this rare reunion! a few days on the beach does wonderful things for the soul, but little did we know how our souls would be blackened forevermore.

8:15 pm

after a round or five of drinks, we noticed that several members of the party had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. we discovered them, ominous plunger in hand, staring terrified at a slowly rising toilet (one of two in the house). plunging half successfully, we messaged paul and let him know the situation. only one working toilet isn't ideal for a group of 8 twenty-somethings drunk on beer and full of tacos, but we'd make it work!

8:38 pm

the remaining toilet won't flush. the party grows worried. paul assures us that he will call a plumber.

9:00 pm

paul has no luck with his usual plumber; they won't be able to fix the toilets until the next morning. a five second google search reveals there are twelve (12!) emergency, 24 hour plumbers in virginia beach, but paul did not want to call them. after ""informing"" our dear friend paul of our displeasure, he put his nose to the grindstone and made a few calls. a plumber was found! magic!

9:30 pm

raw sewage floods the shower and both toilets. kitchen sink makes a strange noise when turned on. the house likely possessed. drinks have been drunk like it's the end of prohibition and we cannot drive or uber to safety. after all, where would we go? we pray to whatever eldritch creature haunts our plumbing to spare us.

10:01 pm

the stench. dear god. the stench.

11:20 pm

emergency plumber arrives with paul and paul's friend in tow. one of them goes to the roof. one of them pounds a pabst blue ribbon. advance guard sobered up and makes an emergency run to a public bathroom. we split the party.

12:20 am

plumber ventures inside the splash zone to duct tape garbage bags around the toilets to seal them in preparation for ""the final blasting."" paul's friend fails to discover how to ""switch off his nose"" and taps out (""i'm out man, i'm out.""). it's been hours since most of us have relieved ourselves. the backyard beckons us with its soothing siren call, but we resist. *for now.*

12:22 am

paul assures us the problem will soon be fixed and to keep partying. classic paul! we oblige, blithely unaware of the horror shit show still awaiting us.

12:24 am

the final blasting. the stench. the horror. the splatter. we all take 2d6 damage.

1:00 am

paul & co. tell us the bathrooms are fixed but not to flush toilet paper. he requests we instead put used toilet paper in conveniently provided (bagless) trash cans. we decide to maximize our fun and minimize our bathroom usage. we also decide to leave the next morning.

2:00 am: the witching hour

lights flicker ominously. the house isn't finished with us yet…

4:30 am

paul offers a full refund (excellent). he later tries to convince us to stay and only refund the first night (not excellent). we ask for a full refund and promise to evacuate in the morning. he offers to let us stay for free for the remainder of our reservation (excellent?) but we decline and agree to leave by noon (clairvoyant).

10:30 am

the party prepares to leave after a night of sheer terror. we take trash to trash cans, clean the kitchen, and prepare a sacrifice to the toilet gods.

11:10 am

we commence the cleansing ritual in the kitchen. after completion, we agree never to speak of this again. who would believe our onerous, nay odorous, experience?

11:11 am

the great gurgle. we hear, deep from the bowels of hell, a cursed glugging. was it the broken spirit of paul's friend chugging another pbr? nope. the shower had once again started flooding with raw sewage.

11:15 am

we hasten our efforts to flee. paul is called. we finish packing all but the final suitcases into our cars.

11:30 am

we convene to discuss departure. suddenly, one of our party realizes we've been cut off from the last of our supplies by a seeping shit river pooling in the hallway. fearing the end is nigh, a brave hero bounds forth, vaulting across the rising flood waters of the rubicon. we form a fire line to ferry our belongings and our wounded to safety.

11:32 am

water oozes up from the baseboards. satan's septic tank thirsts for blood. the lights flicker once more.

11: 35 am

our dearest friend paul arrives, eloquently prophesying: ""this house is fucked."" agreeing with paul's uncanny observation, we flee the house. the smell stayed with us for days but the memories will haunt us forever.

"i (29m) just spent another awkward holiday with my girlfriend's (28f) rich family my girlfriend and i have been together almost 3 years. 99% of the time, we're great. she's funny and smart and we have a lot of shared interests. but every time we visit her family i start doubting everything. 

they are very wealthy, which by itself is not a bad thing, but they're also very fixated on being rich and have a habit of placing the monetary value of things (and people) over everything else. i come from a very middle class background. i have a good education and a decent career that i really enjoy, but i'm definitely not rich. because of this, they view me as a loser.

for example, yesterday we made the two-hour drive to her parents' in my new-ish honda. when we got there, her mom immediately ordered me to park the car behind the house so the neighbors wouldn't see it. she was furious we didn't bring gf's land rover, which they bought for her as a birthday gift this year. gf doesn't like to drive on long trips and i'm not allowed to drive the land rover (per her parents) so we brought my honda. 

gf's dad has never spoken to me directly. even when she introduced me the first time, he turned to her and said, ""what does he do?"" so we went in the house and i gave her dad the usual, ""hi, merry christmas"" and he gave me the usual disinterested glance. 

one more example: last year i made the mistake of bringing a bottle of wine. it was a $25 bottle, which was pricey for me, and i even had the wine store lady help me pick it out. gf's mom told me to put it in the kitchen, they didn't open it while we were there, and she later admitted to gf they'd re-gifted it to their housekeeper because it was ""gas station hooch."" 

we managed to get through the day yesterday without much drama except the car thing, which i'd normally consider a win. but today i keep thinking about the whole situation with her family and wondering if i'm really willing to deal with these people for the rest of my life. gf and i have tossed around the possibility of getting married more than once but i know they'll never accept me. if we get married i'll have to see them a lot more than once a year. gf has given up trying to defend me to her parents and just ignores their bullshit most of the time, but i can tell it bothers her too. they bankroll a big chunk of her lifestyle and i think she's worried they'll cut her off if she pushes too hard (they've threatened to over other things). 

so, not to sounds like an asshole, but am i wasting my time? is this relationship doomed? gf always tells me she doesn't care what her family thinks, but i'm not sure that's true. she always tries to downplay how shitty they are to me. but i know i'll never be good enough for them, even if i'm good enough for her. 

tl;dr: my girlfriend's rich parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.",8

it's been 12 years, and z has since come out as mtf transgender. she messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. we went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. it was along the lines of, ""i'm sorry for being mean. i was young, and i was struggling with my gender identity.""

i thanked her for her apology. when she asked if she was forgiven, and i tried to avoid answering. i am still not over what she did to me. what z did to me impacted me greatly, as i was a impressionable young girl. i struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

z started getting defensive. she told me that i was being petty and that i should forgive her. i told her, ""why? you will always be the boy that bullied me.  an apology won't change that."" she got really offended when i said the word boy, and said that i was misgendering her. she called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out.

i'd like to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. your advice helped prepare me for what came next.

&#x200b;

pretty soon after i posted, i received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. i knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so i googled the law firm and lawyer's name. i couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so i reached out to them. the letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. they asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. i don't know exactly what's happening as i have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&#x200b;

in other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that i also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. we still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

a little backstory. me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. i blame him for it and he blames me. i won't go into detail here. we ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. while this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. we rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. one thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. and unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. in the 8 years since we've been divorced i have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and i've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200b;

well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. his parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at disneyland and he want's to take the kids. well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. he asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and i shot him down. it's my week with them and i get to spend it with them. i told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that i need to ""think of them"". i told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200b;

well, this last sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. when i asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. when i asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to disneyland"". asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them i was not letting them go to disneyland with him. he's trying to paint me as the bad guy. i sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. my daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200b;

i'm not though. i think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. i demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"". 

&#x200b;

i'm so pissed right now. am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during my time with my kids? how is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",3
"am i being a prick? basically my so (26f) is unemployed and has begun spending £80 a week renting a horse. her total income is about £130 a week in benefits including child maintenance and we obviously have bills to pay for and rent. i didn't think it was really an option to spend that much money so she could see a horse from time to time but she feels it's completely justified. she's quick to criticise my choice to go out for some drinks maybe once every month or two and i do work full time. for the sake of peace i've told her i'm happy with her decision as long as she can continue contributing towards rent (£35 a week for her) but she's really pissed off that i insisted she explain how she's going to be able to afford it. what do you think, was i an asshole to question her choice?",8
"neighbor tresspassed on my property and posted online my custom carved wood in my yard as free for taking. it was taken by someone mistakenly thinking it was hers to give away. how can i proceed legall? long story short, i live in ny. my bfs hobby is to take re-claimed wood custom cut it and make table tops or shelves out of them, selling some tables for $400 or more. i had 3 of these 7ft long oak wood sitting on the side of my house for a month, out to dry in the sun, on planks. those pieces can be sold for $1,200 or more when finished. this lady that lives in the area assumed they were for the trash and publicized the wood online as ""next to a dumpster and going to a landfill"" (my recycling bin was next to this wood, on the back end of my house.) i came home to my wood missing and i found her post online, giving it away for free with my exact home address for all to see. someone unknowingly thinking it was hers to give away snagged them. i contacted the guy, and got it back. i then wrote her a message showing her a screenshot of the ny state government property lines website of my properties boarder which she clearly crossed over to take the photo of the wood on my property. i told her to never do that again and mind her own business. her response was ""i am quite too busy to read all this, either way it was a mistake. good luck out there in this shitty world, it sure is a bear."" after that passive aggressive bullshit i went to the police. i filed for tresspassing. the cop said i could get her for possible larceny. idk how that wouldnwork if she didnt take it herself. i'm just wondering... how far can i push this? i am now completely uncomfortable with doing future projects in my own yard and the entire town i live in now knows my exact address attached to my name because of this lady. the cops said they would go to her home and ask her side of the story... i have pictures of her post, pictures of my property line and screenshots of many people i didnt know very well, asking me if her post was in fact the wood on my property that i had posted on my own fb that i was in search for, linking my exact name to that exact address. i work as a bartender in town, where i have many strange men i dont want knowing where i live. she posted it to my towns facebook page. maybe if she was more kind i would have let bygons be bygons but now, i'm thinking ""the world sure can be a bear""",2
"by not going to the hospital when i knew something was wrong with me as usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. i'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident i was 29 years old. first, a little back story...

sunday, april 2, 2017 started like any other sunday for me. i woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. i drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. i drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. i was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

as i watched the video i felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. having never had a migraine before, i assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. the pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though i was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. they finished the oil and as they did, i texted my girlfriend to let her know that i had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

i got back to her house, popped a couple ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. i woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.

i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. my girlfriend tried her best to convince me that i needed to go to the er but i told her i just needed more rest and would be fine. she reluctantly let me try to rest as much as i could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. the only relief i could find was taking pain killers, which i'm not a big fan of, and napping.

i woke up tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" against my protest, she dragged me to the er...and saved my life.

i went in to the er and told them my symptoms, also telling them that i have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. they sent me to do a ct scan of my head, without the contrast because i wouldn't let them tap an iv on my arm. the ct scan was performed and i was brought back to the room to await the results. as i sat there i caught the dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""it was at this point i knew....something was fucked up!"" (dave chappelle voice)

the dr. came flying into the room and said, ""hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. i need to tap an iv on you right now, do another ct scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to stanford asap!""

my life stopped. ""a stroke? i'm 29? how could i have had a stroke?"" i couldn't comprehend what was happening but i looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. i got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (side note: i live in california but grew up in new jersey which is where all my family still resides) i quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. i asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

what happened next is a whirlwind. they tapped an iv, did a ct scan then i was transported by ambulance to stanford icu. i was greeted by the entire neurology department, both residents and students alike. the first woman i met said she, ""couldn't believe i was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" she told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

as i laid in icu they tapped an a-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more iv's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. they had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and i wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. they were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

my parents flew in from jersey by the next day and i was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (wednesday). if you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. i've had 3. they lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are not asleep. they then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. let me repeat, you are awake for this!

the first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. the blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. i was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and i was allowed to leave the hospital by friday morning. i used up all my fmla leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

but wait...there's more!!!

6 weeks later i had to go back to stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. this time they found the culprit. i had what is known as an arterioveneous fistula burst inside my brain. it's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. to my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which i did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke i went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. i was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the best neurosurgeons in the world. a 3rd angiogram was performed while i was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

i awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain i have ever been in. while i was asleep, two more iv's had been put into my arm, an a-line had been put in my wrist again, and i had a c-line, which is an iv in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. the fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. the next day after the surgery i realized that i had double vision so bad that i couldn't see with both my eyes open. it was either one or the other. i had to patch my eye until i could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. my surgery was on a wednesday and by friday i was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

fast forward, to october 2, 2017.

my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. around 11:30 am i took my lunch and finished reading my book i had been reading. at 12:30 pm i returned to work and about 10 minutes later i decided i had to use the bathroom. i left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. i started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. i think i tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in april) for help but i don't remember because i blacked out. next thing i remember was a foreman standing over me asking if i was alright and all i could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

i was delirious, i had smashed my face on the concrete when i fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. my supervisor took me to the er where they did ct scans, blood work, ekg and chest x-rays. my white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

i did a follow up with my pcp (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to stanford neurology to talk with them. and so i have...and this is where i am today...

i was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. the issue, as i've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. due to the amount of time i allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.

what this means for me now is i'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. thank god the company i work for is so large that they can move me to another position where i won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment i feel. working construction has been my all time favorite. i'm a blue collar guy and i get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. i've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. my days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is done. it sucks. i'm not happy about it, but i don't let it change my outlook on life.

i refuse to give up on life. i can get through anything and i will get through this. i'm out of work until january 8, 2018 at which point i will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as i did before.

i tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. please, i'm begging you! if you ever feel like something is wrong with you...do not hesitate! go to the hospital! don't be like me, mr. toughguy, thinking you can get through it. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. may god bless your life and your health

"update: i (27m) have unknowingly been using my gf's (27f) ex's molded dildo to get her off previous post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/a4cky3/i\_27m\_have\_unknowingly\_been\_using\_my\_gfs\_27f\_exs/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a4cky3/i_27m_have_unknowingly_been_using_my_gfs_27f_exs/)

so, we had the talk. my relationship is over. after some awkwardness, and a couple glasses of wine late saturday, i brought it up. she again tried to deflect and change the subject, but i demanded we stay on topic. i told her outright how i felt, how i thought this was disrespectful and dishonest on her part, etc. she tried to play it off like i was being immature and this wasn't a big deal. then she spun it into a penis size issue. i kept trying to tell her that the bigger problem is using a dildo molded from her ex-bf and not the fact that it was bigger than me, but she kept going with the accusations. i told her i wouldn't have had an issue if she wanted a big toy and i was down for anything, but it feels she has a weird, emotional connection to this dildo.

the conversation then took an uglier turn as she was outright say i have a small penis, premature ejaculation issues, etc. i knew there wasn't any way this was going to get settled in an adult manner, so i outright told her the relationship was over.

thanks for the overwhelmingly supportive comments in my original post. they were helpful and confirmed my feelings. now i guess i will have to deal with the humiliation of my ex telling people why we broke up. i'm sure she will spin it as a size issue.

"insecure gf caught flirting throwaway for obviousness. this is gonna be a long one. 

where to begin? girlfriend has previously accused me of not seeing obvious red flags with other women. friends, coworkers, acquaintances. even being in the same room as one of these people is a problem for her which has resulted in my not going out to company functions and cutting off entire circles of friends where the person is a part of.

fine. i love her. i understand that these people are chapters in my life that may not be around later so it's not that big of a deal even though i've lost sleep over it. 

girlfriends friend introduces her to some new people. one of these she immediately clicks with and ends up on the phone until 6am. while i can only hear one side of the conversation, this guy has asked her numerous questions about her relationship and sexual history which she obliged and answers. some of these stories i've never heard before. call it insecurity but i've never asked a woman if she's had a one night stand or what her sexual kinks were. i asked her about it afterwards making reference to the situations she's put me in in the past and her immediate response was to accuse me of being controlling and scaring her. what?

a few days roll by and she's continued these talks with this person. we've had our arguments and came to an understanding of 'if he does or says anything that crosses a line' she will end the friendship. 

but where is the line? he's already had her describe herself. explain past relationships. sex talk and favorite kinks. taking until hours in the morning. where is the fucking line?

i told her that her friendship with this person is literally destroying me and she assures me i have nothing to worry about. 

well. 

i just looked at her phone.

and while i wish i didn't. i'm glad i can see with my own eyes that she lied to my fucking face. they've been flirting. the questions via text were 10x worse. and her friend that introduced them encourages this, telling her how she keeps her relationship from her s/o. 

but what's worse for me is that she had the fucking nerve to tell this guy that i'm being insecure and allow him to chime in that i'm creating disorder. then shortly asking her if she would date him if possible. and her saying yes. 

not even 2 full days into 2019 and i'm about to break up with my girlfriend over a dude she met online not even 3 days ago. 

username checks out. 

do i ask for advice now or am i on the right track. i need clarity...

thank you for making it this far.

"can marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least? they're over-saturating the market to the extent that they're really going to go the way of the western at some point. talk about franchise fatigue. yeah, *marvel isn't immune*. they're going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

and, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren't honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest marvel releases. 

from a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren't good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. the stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

they're almost identical to the transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

no, i'm not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up rt with fresh scores for every marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it ""4 stars"" or ""fresh"" because ""it's fun, i guess"" or ""it'll work for the audience it's meant for"". these films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it's in the zeitgeist to. 

of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, marvel is the one that earned that success the least. it just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them ""new"" and ""creative"" because they change up the setting a bit. no. no, i'm sorry, that's not the picture of creative dexterity. they're safe, bland, blow em up action films.",6

"update my ex girlfriend committed suicide.. i am a firefighter and had to find her body its been a bit over 6 months since i posted that story and i want to give you a quick update on my life. im on mobile so i apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 tl;dr my ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. she was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. i am a firefighter in nj, but go to school in nh. i received the call and conducted research to find her. i drove back down to help with the search. we found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. i was in a dark place for a while after that. i drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. for a good amount of time i distanced myself from any girl who i met.

the funeral wasnt long after and jim didnt even show up. im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


i didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. it felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. the depression i felt was destructive.

my chief reached out to me not long after because i never told him how i knew her. he asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. i was in nh so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

i lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. i had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

after 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. i met this really nice girl named sarah. we talked  and even hooked up a couple times. after a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. i told her i couldnt. i told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. she took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. i felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. i didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

fast forward another month my friend kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. i accepted and thats when i met kristen. kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. we ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. i opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. she completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

she convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. so i made an appointment and went. the therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. i joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

i did my first story and kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. it was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. i continued doing these events and kristen went to every single one. 

after 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. she understood. weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

every time im in nj i go to lydias house and support her mom. on christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews. 

the way i was able to get relief for my pain was helping others. and if it wasnt for kristen i wouldnt have the guidance to do it.",8

"by going for a walk and accidentally traumatising a woman for life obligatory ""happened a few years ago etc"" but basically there was this walking/bike path near my house that i would occasionally walk along for exercise.

sometimes, while walking, i'd set myself a personal goal, like ""reach that pole by the end of this song"" or whatever (i listened to music while i walked).

well, one time i saw someone walking in front of me. they were a considerable distance ahead of me, but i decided that my goal that night was to overtake them by the time i reached my turnaround point.

so i started walking faster to catch up and overtake them, and realised it was a woman. at the time i didn't think anything of it, because, hey, we're both on the same walking path for the same reason; getting healthy.

as i slowly yet surely got closer to her, i noticed she would occasionally turn her head and look behind her. i'd had a couple close calls with people riding bikes along the path (my fault, i only really owned dark colours), so whenever she looked behind her, i'd turn around and look behind me, because i thought she may have heard a bike bell that i hadn't heard over my music. meanwhile i kept my speed up because i was on pace to beat her in our race to my turnaround point.

near to my turnaround point it gets quite dark, because trees hang over the path; and it's of course here that i finally catch up with her..

as i get within two metres of her, she suddenly spins around and enters into what i can only describe as a karate/taekwondo attack position (legs braced and arms ready). aimed directly at me.

i immediately realise what i've done (wearing dark colours, looking behind me when she did, powerwalking towards her).
i gave her the most awkward smile in the world while i powerwalked past her, walked wayy past my turnaround point so i could avoid her on the way back, and seriously considered powerwalking myself off the nearest cliff.

as an added ""bonus"", i later learned that there was a notorious rapist named ""the bike path rapist"" that operated in that specific area of the bike path a few years prior.

an example of what i'm talking about here is that i used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  at first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  the answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether i do it or not. now i don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

i also noticed that i was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. people would come but nobody ever really made a point to say  that they appreciated i was doing it. i stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. now i only do it if i feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.

these are all things *i* would appreciate if someone did *for me* but that doesn't mean everyone else feels the same way.",9

"when i was hired i was given a key and told if i lose it i owe $15,000. i lost it. do i have to pay up? i am located in michigan.  

okay so when i was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) i was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  i was told that if i ever lost said key i would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

i have lost this key.  (it was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. i was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

so now my boss and my boss' boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the ""money i owe.""   i have received letters from their official letterhead and i am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. and they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

i have no intention of paying the fine.

the catch is that i was told this was the consequence verbally when i was handed the key.  my supervisor told me ""you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we'll worry about that later.""   i replied with ""to be clear, i will not be paying that if i haven't signed yet.  do you want to keep possession of the key until then?""  my supervisor laughed as though i was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn't forget to have me sign, he promised.

well he never brought it up again and i of course did not either.  

my question is.  can i be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of ""verbal contract?"" at this point i have not reminded them that i never signed.  i have simply ignored them.  but i worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and i'm not sure how to proceed.  i will be visiting my lawyer monday.  so hopefully more answers then.

"for purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry? this issue is honestly making me frustrated. almost everyone is saying i am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and i genuinely don't know if what i did was correct or not. i just feel so lost. please, please do help.

i am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when i was 13. i have 2 really deep,long facial scars. i have been bullied really bad because of it. i am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. people make fun of other people by saying things like ""why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" i am honestly used to it. those people didn't matter to me anyway.

but there is this girl i had known since middle school. let's call her back i guess? sorry, i honestly don't know how this works. i had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. i thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. my family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. i can play a guitar so i made this whole song for her. i went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. this was the first time i felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and i felt that regardless of what i do, she shall see me for who i am and at least accept me as a friend.

i was over the moon when she ended up accepting. we went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. she was really sweet to me. the next week or so was honestly heaven. people started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, i honestly cried everyday because i felt so fortunate to get so much love.
it all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on instagram and followed beck, sent screenshots to me. i honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

she had posts saying 'fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his valentine's"", 'making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of march, and then distance themselves from me. she apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.and thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since i was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

i was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. my blood was boiling. i researched about this award, found a facebook page about it online.i went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

she is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. i am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly i have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


edit: i am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. each comment means the world to me. i am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. no one besides my family has said these things to me. i know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. from the bottom of my heart,thank you.

edit 2: honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. i promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. thank you for the gold.thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. i honestly have gone through as many as i can and i just feel really fortunate and grateful.

i sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

edit 3: i am sorry for boring you with all these edits. i geniunely can't thank you guys enough. i showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. i am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

but, i have been noticing a worrying number of dms saying me i could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

i am not this kind of person and i hope nobody is. i have my own integrity. it's not right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. a couple of other dms sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. it's honestly horrifying. i am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. i just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

i thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. a lot of women are amazing. my mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and i am sure many women out there are amazing.  please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. because i am not going to do that, ever. please don't say all women are manipulative etc.

\-i do season my food and cook it in other ways besides steaming or boiling.

"i got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. after 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. i need help on how to handle this. 
i am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

at 16 i slep with my good friend jared . the condom broke and my daughter was created. my parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. i couldn't bring it over myself to. i wanted to keep the baby. ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. so i did. i went to my friends house and his parents took me in. they weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

in that time my friend and i started to develop feelings for each other.

i had my daughter and about 2 moths later jared's  brother  came back into their life's. he was a recovering heroin addict. as we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. my parents got wind of that. they dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my mil also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

so they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. it was a dark time i thought they were going to take my baby. in the end they didn't find anything substantial.

but them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. as it was a small town every mistake i made got back to my parents.

i was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? cps charges because neglect.
i was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . cps.

christmas loads of people stayed at jared's house because it was a big family. cps because many strange men were there.

they eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. if they had done it more i think it could have been an offence.

the last call was 5 years ago.

eventually jared and i married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. we worked retail jobs and studied. it took us longer than average to graduate but we did. with a lot of help of his parents. jared is now an engineer and i work as a graphic designer.

we were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. our life's look normal now.

anyway a week ago i get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

i don't really know what to do. because while they didn't have to take care of my while i was pregnant i wished they had at least supported me. and while i get that they were panicking because they thought i was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years.",8

we've been together for 3 months and i had no idea that she held those beliefs. she's always been a calm, ""make love not war"" kinda person and very kind to everyone. this is completely out of character and i'm still not sure if she was trolling or not. 

yesterday evening we were sitting in the car and she was talking to some guy from her internship. she sounded heated and they were clearly arguing over something. when she hung up she said that he was an asshole, a douchebag etc...then she started calling him a ""dirty ass jew"". i was shocked to say the least and didn't even know what to say, it came out of nowhere. she said that all jews are ""extremely arrogant"" and that they disgust her. 

for the record, we never discussed our religious backgrounds. neither of us are religious (she's middle eastern) so that's just not something we ever brought up. 


she continued saying that you can't trust jews, that they're all ""rats"" and that she'd rather die than associate with someone ""so corrupt"". i asked her if that's how she really feels and she said yes of course.


i still haven't told her that i'm jewish, i'm not even sure how she will react when i do tell her. should i even bother? it sucks because she's an amazing girl and i'm ridiculously attracted to her but had no clue she was like this. any advice?

"for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out. throwaway as my dad uses reddit. 

so i'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. 

my parents decided to give me a gift for when i graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. i remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. 

that was untill i found out the terms and conditions, i can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses i can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. 

so i told my parents that i cant accept the gift as i dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,i also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. 
i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where i was called ungrateful and that i'm not a nice daughter. so i walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off. 

reflecting back i do think that i might be the asshole but i'm unsure so i've come to you.

i'm still getting comments and private messages asking a lot of the same stuff, so - i'm 14, he's 13. as for why i 'let him do it a second time', well i do still have to sleep, and i kept recording myself until i made this post and people pointed out why it might be such a bad idea. also a lot of people asking how i know what semen smells like. how do you think? calm down and stop calling me names.",8
"i think my 3 year old is being sexually abused at daycare x-post from /r/parenting originally posted in /r/parenting, but it was suggested i post here... edit per bot request: we are in california.

my son has been in the same church run daycare/preschool for about a year. at the time, we didn't love the place, but we were desperate because i needed to go back to work and it was the only place that would work with my part time schedule. (we didn't love it because it didn't seem as academic as others, but he was only two so we let it go).

he seems to really like it there. most days he doesn't even say goodbye to me, he just runs into which ever room they have setup and starts playing. he seems to like some kids and teachers more than others, but that seems normal enough. he occasionally has rough/clingy mornings, but they are pretty rare and seem to correlate with story time on fridays, but not every friday.

i'm not sure if some of his new behaviors are unusual or just par for the course for a toddler/threenager. he never used to mind diaper changes, but started kicking and screaming during them sometimes after he started at the daycare. he's always been a strong willed kid, but screaming ""i don't want to"" and ""put me down"" are things he picked up at daycare for whatever reason. i thought it was odd that the church pastor would be reading to the kids sometimes when i dropped my kid off on fridays, and even weirder that he sometimes had kids in his lap, but the teachers were always there and it was always a group activity.

we had some concerns, but nothing concrete and more that he was learning to hit/push than anything worse. until today. we finish up dinner and i get the bath ready for our 1 year old, leaving the 3 year old at the dinner table with my husband. i'm minding my business, bathing the baby when my husband comes into the bathroom to relay something the 3 year old just did and said. it should be noted that our toddler doesn't yet speak in complete sentences or fully respond when   asked questions (ex ""what did you do at school today?"" gets no answer while ""did you paint at school today?"" garners an appropriate ""yep!"" or ""nope!""). our toddler had finished his dinner and, after we had cleaned up his plate, he asked for peanut butter pretzels, one of his favorite snacks. normally, we'd say no, but he'd been a good kid all day so my husband said ""sure! but cheek kiss first"" and leaned into our normally very affectionate kiddo. our son slapped my husband across the face and said ""no! pretzels now!"". not great, but not out of the ordinary for him after a long day (we don't hit our kids, but he definitely struggles with hitting when he's frustrated). he did/said this twice and then said ""get candy!"". my husband said ""no candy right now"" and then asked ""do you get candy at school?"" our son then grabbed two of my husband's fingers, rubbed the tips with his fingers several times, said ""it's round, it's round"" and then licked them repeatedly. he did this several times. (just typing this is making me nauseous again). my husband asked if that's how he got candy and our son repeated the behavior/motion and then put his finger to his lips and said ""shhhh!"", then put his other pointer finger to my husband's lips and said ""shhhh!"" (we only ever use ""shhh"" to comfort them when crying and have never put our fingers to his or our lips). my husband tried to gently ask more questions, but our son just mumbled nonsense and then asked to get out of his highchair.

my husband came and told me immediately and we got the baby out of the tub, and tried to talk to the toddler again, but he'd moved on and just wanted to go sit on the couch. we didn't know what to do (this was around 730pm), so we called local pd dispatch and they sent over an officer who just told us to speak to the director of the school.

i've tried searching this sub and others and have come across a few sort of related posts, but i have no idea what to do. local resources open in the morning, and we have already told our workplaces that we won't be in tomorrow due to a family emergency, but we don't know where to start. i can't in good conscience send him back there again.

are we overreacting? do we just confront the director? how do we handle this? i obviously don't know what or who exactly, but this definitely seems off. any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.


edit:

first, thanks to everyone for their supportive messages and comments and for taking the time to reply. we are truly blown away by your kindness and thoughtful words. we are also very grateful for all of the advice.

second, an update. our son didn't go to the school today and will not return in the future. we didn't contact the school and we don't plan to at all. we'll be out our deposit, but it's worth it at this point. i have another center that we will be touring next week, but we are also prepared for me to stay home with the kiddos for awhile.

this morning my husband called cps and they said they only handle situations where the abuser is in the home. next, he called the state licensing board and filed a complaint. the school has an otherwise squeaky clean record, but we were assured they would be opening up an investigation and interviewing every employee at the school. finally, we called and then visited the local family advocacy center (basically relevant charities, social workers, law enforcement, etc under one roof). we met with a social worker and recounted the same points as above. when she was done taking notes, she called one of the onsite detectives who confirmed that without actual evidence (ie a verbal description of something from our son or physical evidence), there was nothing he could do. without the cops getting involved, we will not be referred to a forensic psychologist or have the situation otherwise escalated.  as frustrating as that is, we are almost fortunate in a way that that type of evidence doesn't seem to exist (or that we stepped in before it did). as many of you said, both the detective and the social worker agreed that the cop that came by yesterday handled it very poorly, but that there was nothing they could do about that either. the social worker mentioned that our son seemed to be a happy kid, not the withdrawn or angry type she's seen in more serious situations. we were referred to a center that specializes in play based therapy that we will be following up with as well. if anything comes out during those sessions, the situation will be handed over to the authorities at that time. 

i think that covers everything that happened today. my husband had to go back to work so i've been at home on the couch cuddling my kiddos. if there are any developments, i'll update again, but that is it for now.

thank you again for everything, reddit. you truly came through in our time of need ❤️

hi guys, i just wanted to give you a quick update about a post i made 5 days ago on here. you were very kind to me. thank you. it got locked and deleted because i had the wrong username so i've just made another account and added the ""throwra"" to my normal username lullabelleanabelle, so i can make a quick update for this subreddit. i'm not sure if i'm allowed to link to my post because i posted it on another subreddit too. a lot of you suggested i go to the mother in law subreddit which was also a big help. thank you everyone. you're wonderful. 

to clear a few things you enquired about and to just speak about my wonderful partner a little more (if i may). i'm not american, european born and raised, but my husband is and we live here. we met at his friend's wedding where i did the bride's makeup (i'm a wedding mua), and he drunkenly told me during the reception that she looked a bit like a chucky doll (she didn't, and he still doesn't know or care what blusher is). we had some serious words, mostly where i told him to stfu, and then he invited me to dinner as a way of apologising for being an ass and i fell hard. and you guys are so right, he is the best person i have ever met. he's a serious, stoic, super focused and quiet kind of guy, doesn't really speak or smile until he needs to but he's so sarcastic and funny and charming and just so sweet and kind. and he says that he really enjoys my giddy chatterbox. so i think i'll need to hold onto him because that type of patience is rare. he's just my world. 

it hasn't been easy. a few things have happened and i can't honestly say that i'm better off for it. but i'm trying.  again, really not a troll post. i'm not creative enough to write something that fantastical. this is all true and a little bit long so im sorry for that. 

i didn't know how to tell him. or what i wanted to tell him. a bunch of you said to show him this page or my diary but those were my private thoughts, i didn't want to show him ever. so, i told him i could show him the details of the court transcripts and my medical records. they aren't particularly easy to read. those men weren't very nice to me. they had found me walking through a park near my house in the evening and grabbed me and pulled me behind one of the paths where a lot of trees and bushes were. and they had gone to jail. 

he got really upset and told me that he didn't care what any of those pieces of paper said, he knew instantly that his mother was lying and just spewing bullshit. that i didn't have to work up the courage to tell him anything about my past if i didn't want to, he'd never thought for a second i was ever hiding anything from him that would ruin our relationship. he'd always known there was something because of the way my anxiety would come out and my nightmares and struggles during intimacy at times, but he would never have pushed the issue. he wanted me to feel safe with him and he trusted me completely. he said he was so scared that i would leave, especially after offering him a divorce. and he was keeping his family away from me because he didn't want them to stress me out any further. they were just confused and concerned and trying to reach out to us. nothing malicious or accusing. 

i thought it was going to all be okay eventually but unfortunately, 3 nights ago, she sent him a text with some pictures of some parts of my journal. she'd taken pictures of the parts where i described things that had happened almost too vividly and then i had pointed out ways i could have defended myself and questioned why i hadn't fought back, before explaining it away as being my fault, blaming it on the way my body had developed and the way i looked and wanting them to do those things to me. its a disgusting, jumbled piece of my mental state at the time. it was stupid but it was just a way back then to pull all my negative thoughts out of my head and get rid of them so i didn't have to think about the ways i could have stopped it. maybe it was the wrong way to do it but it's all i had, i never went to therapy. she put in her message that i had spread my legs and got her son to believe my sob story but she had proof i was a willing whore and she would never let her children and grandchildren be alienated from her. 

his sister rang him crying and told him that their mom had sent her the same text. and to the other siblings and some others in the family. fil was apparently furious and the family have reached out multiple times to my poor husband to apologise and ask after me. 

things haven't been going well. my husband is so broken over his mother's actions and is just lashing out. he's broken all ties with her and is just so furious at anyone in the family who even reaches out to ask if we're doing okay. he won't let them get in contact with me and is just so angry. he owns the house my in-laws live in and financially supports them 100% and has told them that they'll need to get out immediately and he's done financing their shit. but i'm trying to get him to not do that. it's just a house and some money, it doesn't matter. i don't know how to comfort him or what to say or do to reassure him that he is not to blame for what she's done. 

as for me, i'm just in a fog. i don't know how to process what she did, so i'm not going to until i'm ready. my husband isn't leaving me alone and it helps to just cuddle up and pretend nothing has happened for a little bit. i think we might start some couples therapy, just to be able to learn ways to help each other through this and become closer and communicate better. i'm not ready for any therapy regarding my own stuff yet. it sickens me that they know this about me, that they know a chunk of what my feelings and thoughts were back then. i hate it so much that my husband read those parts and he knows i thought like that about myself. i never wanted to be some damaged victim in front of him. its just shit. 

i won't be posting on here again. 
thank you all for your lovely words. i hope you take care.

edit: thank you all so much for being so kind and wonderful. and thank you to the commenters who privately messaged me telling me how much i must have enjoyed and asked for it and offering to reenact it with me again. no.",8
"woman threatens to sue me because i posted her on reddit summary:

a few hours ago a woman contacted me asking if i was able to design a logo for her and her perfume brand.
the conversation was polite until she said she was unable to pay me and might was able to pay me in a different way (which i think nudes and  i am under age).

"the argument ""schools should teach me life skills and not algebra"" is stupid because nobody would pay attention anyways. our school had a mandatory class on personal finance. nobody cared. not a single kid remembers a thing from that class, and i can almost guarantee that it would be the same way for most other schools. people just wouldn't take it seriously.

let's edit this a bit because people have made some fairly good points. i would say the most of the time, the kid using this argument is the kid who wouldn't pay attention. i hear it a lot from people who are bombing algebra and are just pissed because they don't think it's useful (it might not be but that's not the point). usually, what they're saying is ""i hate algebra"" and trying to sound smart about it.",6

"by identifying my friend's father's penis and ruining dinner happened about a week ago, but i've been hesitant to post this as i wasn't sure if it really fits. no one involved in this story is a minor. tl;dr at bottom.

i am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. there are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. we were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iphone. she was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.

""what?"" the collective asked.

""there's some dude's dick here!""

we gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). we laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. we looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. we also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. we couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.

before i turned the setting off, everyone using my family icloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos i saved to my phone. this got annoying after my mom started questioning things i had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so i turned it off.

without thinking of the consequences, i asked her if she shared an icloud account with anyone. she said she shared one with her parents. she got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.

i've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. the rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. we sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.

the image is burned into all of our minds. i've never met her father but i'm terrified one day i will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and i'll know exactly what his penis looks like.

tl;dr: friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, i can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through icloud, and now none of us are okay.

* we are all americans and nudity, esp with your family, is more taboo for us
* we are assuming these were taken in a sexual connotation, which isn't really how we like to think about our parents
* it wasn't crying like oh my god what will i do, it was more a mix of laughter and crying like ""i can't believe this is what just happened""

"by relaxing too much during a sensual massage bit of back story. i started talking to a guy on reddit last week. we hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. we decided to meet for a date on friday. i have ibs and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. i was also very tired.

the fu: so i'm at this guy's house and i've made us a very nice mac n cheese. there was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. we're then snuggling on the sofa and i feel a big fart brewing. i'm hoping i can just absorb it back in to my body if i hold on to it long enough. 

we start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. i choose a 'relaxing' oil. i'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. he starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. i'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.

i then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart i have ever expelled. the fart i was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. it was hella loud and it was hella long. and it was right on his balls. it was so forceful, they vibrated.

his response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'at least you didn't shit yourself'.

tldr: farted on a first date's balls.

"i 34m just discovered the real side of my girlfriend 33f we had no issues before, and she was my role-model. i'm honestly shocked by this.

yesterday i got invited to her place, things were going great... she turned on the tv and we were watching some movie about poverty-stricken family, in the plot it was around christmas time.

after a few minutes there was a part where the family was eating christmas dinner. my girlfriend made a nasty comment which was something like: ""look at that crap dinner."" i didn't really react to her comment.

the mother in the movie brought the turkey and my girlfriend said ""that looks like cow's placenta."" that's when i sat up and said ""are you serious?""

i told her that not everyone has the luxury of a ""fancy"" christmas dinner, i told her to look at the real image, they have at least they have their significant others, it's not about the presents and all after all...

then she said something along the lines of: ""yeah, that money you spent on food to donate to charities on christmas day could have been used to fund me a better gift.""

that was when i lost my shit and just went home. i haven't talked to her since. i'm contemplating whether to stay with her anymore.

any advice appreciated.",8

"atm gave me $1200 instead of $100. i told the bank, a different bank, called twice and sent them a letter. but i got arrested at work and spent the weekend in jail before the charge was dropped (mi) i'm in nursing school. an arrest for a felony will put my financial aid and chance of getting a nursing license in jeopardy even though the charge was dropped. i didn't even have $1200 in my account and i have a receipt from the atm showing that only $100 was withdrawn and my balance was $400 after the withdrawal.

i went into the bank as soon as i happened but the teller told me it was my money and so did the one beside her. they said the manager was not available. i went to another bank across town and i told the manger there but he said it was mine. i called their customer service twice and have recordings of both calls where they said it was mine. i mailed them a letter and i didn't spend the money.

then 10 days later i was arrested for stealing the money from the bank. i was at my job as a waitress when i was arrested and they fired me when i went back after i was released. it was a saturday afternoon and they told me i would be in court on monday. i told them i tried to tell the bank but no one listened. on monday morning i thought i was going to court but they gave me my stuff back and said i was free to go and the charge was dropped.

"for asking my cousin not to bring his autistic son (my nephew) to my home any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife? i know from the title, it definitely sounds like i would be the asshole but please hear me out. i have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. my nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (i don't know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. 

recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we've hosted them in the past when they've visited. the first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. he drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. my wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. he told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

this weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. his mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn't pay attention to him as much as before. he got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. when my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. i stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. here's the part where i may be the asshole. i told my cousins i didn't feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and i know for sure she didn't, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. i told them i couldn't allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. i apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. they didn't say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

i guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that i should've been more understanding and that i was wrong to ask them to leave. 

am i the asshole?

edit for added info: 

thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. there's not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when i saw how many had reached out to me), but i wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. the first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. my dad is an only child so the cousin i refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad's first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). i'm not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). the reason i refer to him as my nephew is because he's the generation after mine in our family tree and it's less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. a lot of people have posted that it's not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, i don't care, and my family's never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. i apologize if it was misleading in my post. without being specific, in the western state i was born and grew up in, it's not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. i call him my nephew because my cousin and i were close and i still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though i don't know how after this situation). 

2. some have asked if i was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. the first time, i thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. remember, in my mind he's my nephew and i never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. regarding the situation that happened this weekend, i was only concerned for my wife and son's safety. i didn't know how he would react and followed my cousin's lead, but wasn't about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. i don't know what was said to my paternal grandmother but i don't want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we've both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",3

"update: neighbor touched my son   

original post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor\_touched\_my\_son\_nj/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor_touched_my_son_nj/)

i know the original post didn't get a lot of attention and there probably isn't much demand for an update, but i did want to thank the people who commented and maybe give some guidance on expectations for anybody who might have the horrible luck to fall into a similar situation. also it's just not something we want to talk about with friends/family…. so call it therapy for me.

&#x200b;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

tldr for the 1st post: last monday, soon after i left for night school, my son (5) reported to my wife that our (deaf & mute) neighbor touched his private parts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200b;

update: on tuesday morning the entire family went to the police station to file a report. my wife and i interviewed with an officer and detective together at 1st and then my wife alone. after that the detective contacted the county prosecutor's office.

an hour or so later we were on our way to a county facility, so we could all be interviewed by a couple of detectives from the county prosecutor's office. once interviews were over the county detectives sat down with my wife and i to let us know my son had given them some actionable information and they intended to act relatively quickly. the detective who interviewed the children had tears in her eyes. 

from there we went home.

that afternoon, neighbor knocked on the door, looking to play with the kids. i opened the inner door (left the storm door closed) and made it clear he needed to go away, which he did. soon after i went to night school, asking my wife to stay in doors with the kids for the night, which she did. when i got home, she said nothing else had occurred.

for the most part, wednesday was quiet and relatively normal. we did not see neighbor all day. wednesday night, we came to know why. a detective called to let us know neighbor had been taken into custody on tuesday night (while i was at school) and would remain in custody for a few days until his hearing (i assume arraignment).

thursday morning a woman from the state dcf/cp&p office came to the house. she made a cursory check of the house and interviewed my wife & i together. to my mind, this was actually a good thing.  she was able to let us know that neighbor had been charged with 2 counts (i don't recall exactly what they are). she also provided 2 other important facts:

1 – neighbor had a history, albeit old (late 80s, early 90s) and in california.

2 – neighbor had admitted the act to the detective that arrested him on tuesday evening.

from there, she advised we were entitled to have my son evaluated by a state specialist and possibly therapy if necessary. we will need to have them check in with us once a month until the case is closed on their end, and the evaluation etc. will necessarily extend that time frame, but we opted to go this route anyway.

while she was there i asked if she knew what the likely penalty was (she did not), and whether or not she thought we should pursue a restraining order, if neighbor was likely to be free again soon. she was unsure and promised to check in with the detectives on the subject.

friday (yesterday) afternoon, we received a call from the county detective. she informed us that neighbor's hearing was set for monday and that his lawyer intended to ask that he be released to his home, with an ankle monitor, for the period between the hearing and his trial. she wanted to ask for our input as to how hard the prosecutor should push to have neighbor remain in custody.

here's the thing. neighbor, so far as we can tell, actually lives with a family… and they have small children. i advised the detective that we were ok with neighbor being 'home', so long as he was confined to (approximately) his property. she confirmed that would be the case, and that a 'no contact' order would be in place. we agreed that was ok with us, but also said we felt strongly the family with whom neighbor lives should have input.

that brings us up to date and, to be honest, i am torn. i hate what this man did. i hate that it has happened before, and i never want it to happen again. with that said, at first i was unsure as to whether or not neighbor even knew what he did. he clearly has some emotional/intellectual challenges. but he also knew, at least to some extent, what he was doing…. as he admitted the act to the arresting detective. i get the feeling he is something akin to a deaf/mute lennie from of mice & men, and that tears my heart out. i don't think he really understands, and i don't want to be vindictive to someone like that. at the same time, he touched my son. if there were no clear impairment, i would want to take a baseball bat to his head. but there is, and instead i just feel like shit for everyone involved. this sucks, full stop.

on a more selfish note, the megan's law registry. there are a handful of homes for sale in the area. until now, my wife and i were hopeful that more families with children would move into the area. that hope is now over. because neighbor's history all predates mega's law, he was not on the registry. now he will be, and no families with kids will move into the area. i realize this is tangential to the main topic, and pretty self-centered, but it's just one more way that neighbor is going to make our lives a smidge worse, just by existing. to repeat myself, this sucks, full stop.

sorry for the book, and if the mods see fit to remove the update… as it's not all that particular to legal matters, i understand. honestly, i just feel a bit better getting it all down and putting it out there.

thanks to anyone who reads through.",2
"for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. she would make noises in between conversations like ""bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. this is especially embarrassing when i am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


i have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. i have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


it was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. we went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""


seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. i rolled my eyes and told her:


""i am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. please excuse me."" 


then i left the restaurant without her. i don't know what occurred to me but i probably shouldn't have done that, but i guess it kinda just snapped. aita?",3
"by being funnier than my so and allowing her to post it on reddit. this happened last night/the wee hours of this morning. 

last night while my so was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. she is a bartender and didn't want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. 

me, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. so i jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. 

while i'm making my journey, i decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. i'm in a pretty great mood. i had the day off and my so was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some new girl. 

my journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. just open desert. so while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. ""what can i do to add a little romance to this situation? cover the bed in some dove chocolates? maybe some flowers?"" 

i make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. miraculously, i made it back home before her.

finally i decide, ""nah, romance isn't nearly as great as comedy."" so when i get home, i break open the box and spell out ""anal?"" on the bed with the tampons. 

so gets home and goes straight to the room to change. i follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. 

she takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. now she won't stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is ""famous"". 

i've created a monster. 

tldr; spelled out ""anal?"" with my so's tampons. she thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. reddit agreed and now she thinks she's famous and is holding her new found karma over my head.

edit: wow! my first ever medal. thank you kind stranger. now at least i can hold this over her head whenever she randomly shouts out how much karma she has.

edit 2: gentleman, we are currently in the lead. whoever has more karma at the end of the night gets to fuck the others ass.

(he was putting new batteries in them, etc). he comes back, we do our thing and go to sleep. we wake up in the morning and our son comes into our room and says ""what is that on the table?!""
...i immediately realized the fu. husband did not so he asks ""what is it?"" 
son: a purple banana (ps he's 12 so he knew what it was) and he walks out of the room. 
cue immediate shame/laughter. i wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. 

side note. we did not use that particular ""purple banana"" that night-thank god. 

after we composed ourselves husband goes into sons room and says ""what do you want for breakfast?"" 
son says ""i lost my appetite"" 

i'm still dying inside. i'm sure son is too.

tl;dr left a dildo on the table like a moron, son won't ever be the same.

edit: ok guys-you realize it's 2019, the internet is alive and well, and 7th grade 12yr old boys are exploring etc right?! it's not crazy that he knows what dildos are.

also edit: i didn't treat it like it was shameful and i know i didn't actually ruin his life. but no one wants to think of their parents having sex. we laughed about it afterwards and made purple banana jokes the rest of the day. we are open and communicate etc. i was mortified and still am, because it's embarrassing.",4
"for sleeping over at my gfs 4 nights a week making her roommate uncomfortable and causing her to flip out? let me preface this by saying that i (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. i've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. this is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. i'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

now, i've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. her beds bigger for starters and i cant cook at home because it's always congested, so liv and i cook a meal twice a week at hers. she has a roommate who we'll call (bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. i've tried my best to get to know bianca but it's not reciprocated and i can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. she's never asked a question about what i do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

liv told me that bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. i hate being the cause of her discomfort. whenever i'm at livs house, i don't use the living room and go straight to livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). besides cooking with liv, i'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

here's where liv and i may have screwed up. we were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). all of a sudden bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
we both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

their relationships gone down the gutters since i came along and i can't help but feel responsible. 

on an end note, liv and i want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

my mates telling me i'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and i should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. but i see it as the next step before moving in together, that i'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. so aita?",3

"for not replacing my sisters $3000 gaming laptop after my child spilled juice on it because it was on the floor? title is pretty self explanatory. but basically over the weekend, i had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. she's babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. she gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. things happen and somehow it got knocked over.

her laptop no longer switches on. she's blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. i told her no as it shouldn't have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. she's refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she'll never babysit for me ever again. i really don't feel as though it's my responsibility.. aita?

edit: yikes this blew up. a few people have asked for more info. yes, i packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. i supplied everything he'd need for the weekend - including nappies and food. my parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she'd be able to spend time with him. it wasn't just 'babysitting' but more enjoying time with her nephew. i gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as 'payment' for watching my son. every other time she'd had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach.",3
"ma man that sold me a car called my insurance company and listed himself as a driver. now they won't take it off until he verifies that we don't live together. he's blocked my number. i bought a car last year from a mutual friend that i didn't know well at all. everything was fine until this past june, when he fell into some heavy debt. he gave me a call sometime around june, asking me to take out a loan for him, to which i refused. red flag number one right there. after this, he began to harass and pester me for money (was already paying way more than i should've been monthly for this car). i eventually just gave the car back and that was that. i gave the car back mid july and purchased a new one (nissan altima) from a legitimate dealer. this morning i received a call from my insurance company (progressive), saying that this man has listed himself as a driver, costing me another $500. i calmly explained the situation, but they told me that unless he can provide proof that we don't live together, (we absolutely do not) i still have to pay it. this is absurd, how is this allowed? the guy in question is obviously desperate and trying to get back at me for giving the car back, but how can i provide proof for someone else? this is in massachusetts and i have progressive insurance.


update #1: okay so a lot has happened since i first posted. for starters, i should clarify some things. we signed an agreement that i would pay monthly increments for the title. until the car (30k) was paid in full, he held onto the title. initially he said i would be under his insurance, but only a few days after i saw this guy was kind of shady and switched to my own. i did not have the car in my name, which is why i was able to give it back so easily. i just thought ""screw this drama, i'll just get a new car."" today my adjuster happens to be ""out sick"" but i reported this man to both the state and federal insurance fraud agencies. a representative of progressive informed me that the man in question blatantly lied to my adjuster and told him we live together, and that he drives my vehicles occasionally. i have only spoken to him a number of times, so this is certainly not true. i've been in contact with a representative of both progressive and the insurance fraud agencies all morning and am finishing sending in documentation as we speak. i'm expecting a phone call and will update soon.

update #2: not much has changed since the last update, except everything has been officially reported with all required documentation. luckily i kept all of the text messages between us, which i attached to the reports i filed. with my adjuster out today (of all days, just my luck) it's a bit difficult to get this taken care of. after i settle this, because i am not paying an extra $500, i will most definitely be switching providers.",2

after promising it most likely would not result in another hospital trip, she said yes! we're going out this friday for a dinner. i know some people warned me about dating people at work, but honestly after what i happened i think i'm kinda obligated by the universe to go for it. 

thanks for giving me the support to do it guys. i was gonna flake-out.
so remember ladies and gents, if you ever have a crush on them, fucking dab on them. if it works with the haters, it'll work with the lovers.

tl;dr. gave a girl an asthma attack by dabbing on them. they laughed too hard and ended up in the hospital. reddit made me work up up the courage to ask them out. somehow it worked. what the hell.

"cousin confessed to falsely accusing my brother of rape. he was arrested, convicted and later committed suicide. i have her recorded confession. what should i do with it? (arizona) she accused him of rape years ago. she was 18 and he was 22. it was false and never happened. he was arrested and eventually convicted. when he served his stance and got out he was broken. from what he told me, he was heavily abused during his prison time by other prisoners. he tried to get back to his life and he couldn't. his record, his name on the registry and lack of options. he went from being a student in a top college in the country to having almost no prospects. within a year of being out, he committed suicide.

yesterday was 3 years since his death. this cousin sent word through a friend that she wanted to speak with me and seek my blessing on visiting my brother's grave. i said yes, but figured something doesn't seem right. i went and had a recorder with me and recorded the conversation. also had my boyfriend record a video of our meeting from a distance (it was in public). she told me she's sorry and my brother didn't deserve what happened to him. i asked why and pressed her for an answer, she broke down and said she didn't know who did it and she accused him because he had refused to lend her money she desperately needed and she was angry at him.

the voice recorder got everything, and the video also has audio in parts that match the voice recorder perfectly.

are these evidence useful in overturning that decision? i want to make my brother's slate clean. not only for his memory but also because he has a son he never saw (his girlfriend was pregnant when this happened, he lost his parental rights as a result of this conviction). his son should know this is not the kind of man his father was. if so, how do we begin the process? do we need a lawyer here, or do we need to go to the police?

what consequences (criminal) will she face? will she go to jail?

and, does my brother's estate have a claim against her for damages? of course this belongs to his son now although i don't know how that would work with respect to his parental rights being terminated (doesn't matter, as we'd want his son to be supported more than anything else). and can his son have a separate claim for damages against her? this conviction deprived him of a chance to know his father, because parental rights were terminated.

i know this won't bring my brother back but it can at least provide some comfort to us and to his son, and maybe making things more fair. so please help put me in the right direction.",2

"should i (23f) tell my boyfriend (26m) about the egg? pretty short and sweet. together for 3 years, discussing marriage, have our own place finally, deeply in love. he admitted to me today that he has preemptively hid 50 eggs and 1 giant egg in our apartment for me to find tomorrow. this guy's pretty good! up until then i hadn't seen any. but i just spotted the giant one. i really didn't mean to, i haven't been trying to look for them. 

should i tell him so he can re-hide it? or do i take it tomorrow?

edit: i forgot to mention he had to tell me about the eggs because i was mentioning plans with eggs (we hide them together).

edit update: he came to the room and i said ""what if i told you i found the giant egg?"". he laughed and told me ""well, i got it way up there, since you found it early you'll have to work for it and get it down."" i jokingly pouted until he relented and said ""but if you need help i will."" 

i am not allowed to get it down until tomorrow though! will update then :)

mini update: doing my morning routine. so left for church with his family while i get ready to go and clean a gentleman's house and answer some of the reddit comments! one of the eggs was in my coffee pot. i guess some of these eggs don't stay closed very well, because it was taped shut as well as the ones sitting on my balcony table :) he put so much effort into this! i'm so touched, honestly. it kinda makes my kinky idea for egg hunting look lame by comparison! will be back later once we're both home and i can hunt down all the rest of the eggs

update: firstly, a couple people i think asked so here are the eggs in question(http://imgur.com/a/lw1xoy3). the reese's thing is more of a basket, but i won't question his use of the word egg to describe it. on the shelf i could only see a vague top part of it, but he did mention there's reese's for me in the ""egg"" xd. if you bother to count the little ones there's only 48; i took one with me to the house cleaning (and checked to make sure it was strictly candy inside first!) and ""hid"" it in the gentleman's kitchen. as for the last one, both of us swear i found it, but i must have dropped it somewhere? under the couch or something. idk. in the giant egg there was candy and a frisbee. 

for everyone waiting on the edge of their seats, no proposal :c. but, i mentioned ""a proposal in this would have been pretty cute"" and he laughed and said ""yeah but you'll like the way i've got it planned much better."". which isn't much news to me, as i've said we've discussed marriage at length (i even have potential venues, the first draft of the guest list we both agree on, etc). all i've gotta do is sit tight and wait for him to do it.  i mentioned having hopes, but not expectations, so i'm not disappointed or letting it taint the happiness. searching for the eggs was very fun!! i needed a couple hints, and to get the giant egg i needed quite a bit of terror inducing help including me getting stuck on the night stand i was using and him having to pick me up off of it :) 

and no, i don't think i missed any eggs or that he's hiding one. i think i really did grab them all, and misplaced one.

now it's time for his turn to egg hunt! i'll put slips of paper in each egg i hide that have different ""prizes"" ranging from things i love about him, to kisses/massages, to more r rated things ;) so, that's all folks. no proposal, but a very happy easter on both ends! thanks for sticking with this tale of mine. keep up all your great advice to everyone that needs it on this sub. and to those of you who seek advice for more serious problems than whether or not to admit to finding an egg; i've been there too. if you go through my posting history you'll actually find that so and i went through a very rough patch on r/justnofamily. it took a lot of work on both sides to rebuild and have the healthy happy relationship we have now!

tldr; boyfriend hid eggs. i found eggs. reddit hoped for a sparkly in one of the eggs, but alas, the only sparklies are the foils covering my mini reese's :) but a proposal *is* somewhere on the horizon!

edit: oh and if anyone is wondering how to propose to their so, easter eggs *are* a cute idea.",8

it seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. the thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

this isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. honestly i knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds i know to this day. but it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

just be careful everyone. and please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. this doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind ""sub dedicated to helping others"" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than ""sub dedicated to calling other people assholes."" i just don't want to see lives ruined over this sub.",3

&#x200b;

i wanted to give y'all another update - hopefully the last one. it's been about a year since my original post, ten months since the first update.

&#x200b;

my ex did move out. thankfully, moving day was uneventful, and then he was gone. and as many commentators predicted - when he was gone from the house it was a huge relief. i didn't have to cringe at every little sound anymore. i could breathe again. i was really, really sad - but my space was my own.

aaaand then i got laid off. no joke. helluva one-two punch right there.

the past two years have, on the whole, been incredibly painful. the year that my marriage fell apart, and then the year i had to spend recovering from that blow. i had to job hunt while mourning the death of my relationship, and as soon as i found a new job i also found out my house needed hugely expensive repairs that, after all of this mess as well as having supported my ex not working for a year, i just didn't have the cash for. and figuring out how to be on my own for a while - i had people there to support me, but in the day to day, hour to hour through this mess i was ultimately on my own, and that was hard. (bingeing 'the marvelous mrs. maisel' helped a bit.)

he also kept reaching out. for a while it was occasionally chatty, but as time went on and i came more to terms with how he'd treated me, and how frequently his messages had a tinge of emotional manipulation to them, i distanced myself. he messaged me once to ask if i regretted our entire relationship, on the whole, or if i thought he was a terrible person, on the whole. i didn't respond to that one at all. then he'd reach out with things like ""hey, the tv i took from our living room broke, do you want it from me? like to sell or try and fix?"" i've been doing my best to keep my responses short and clear, in ways that don't invite follow-up. lately he's been wanting to have a post-mortem conversation, to which i said that i wouldn't be ready to consider whether or not that'd be a good idea until our legal ties were ended. (he also just messaged to ask if he could be my roommate, because his rent is really high. i have no words.)

&#x200b;

the good news - and there's thankfully quite a lot of it - the new job i got is possibly the best job i've ever had. a step down in salary, but i'm super happy with the work and the people and the location, and i've been getting rave reviews from coworkers and management, enough that i think i can probably negotiate a decent raise in a few months. i had to get a new car as well (new to me, but purchased used) since my ex got the car we shared in the split, and i was nervous about negotiating and buying a car by myself, which i'd never done before. but i did it - and managed to negotiate the dealer about $1k down - and i absolutely love the car.

also - i met someone new. this person reminds me of my ex in a lot of ways - things like shared hobbies and creativity and sense of humor and charm - but very different in some really important ways. he treats me really well. he's thoughtful and kind and generous - not just to me, but to everyone. in the conflicts we've had (very few) we are able to talk through them calmly - no yelling! - and he shows me how much he respects and cares about my perspective and boundaries and autonomy. he's not broken and doesn't need me to fix him - and i'm not broken either, thank god. maybe carrying a bit of extra baggage, but such is life. this relationship is still new, but it feels like a game-changer for both of us, and i'm excited to see where it leads.

&#x200b;

and one more bit of good news - i will officially be divorced on friday! (yes, the day after valentine's day xd ) there are a few more loose ends to wrap up after that, but not many.

&#x200b;

i wanted to provide this update in part because i know it can be nice to see updates from folks, but also because i wanted to give a bit of hope to anyone who might be in a situation like mine. it can get better. it really, really can. i'm actually happy. it took time and hard work, and things aren't perfect - i'm definitely going to need a lot of time to recover financially, and i'm still sometimes processing the weight of 11 years of emotional abuse (a+++++ for therapy) - but i'm actually truly happy. sometimes i wonder how much of the depression i'd been feeling before he left was the result of how much emotional weight i'd been carrying for so long - his and mine - without truly being aware of it. it's so easy to feel like that dark tunnel is all there ever will be, when you're in the middle of it - but i'm out in the sunshine now, and it feels amazing.",8
"for thinking a divorce announcement due to an affair was an april fools joke? let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


am i the asshole?

"tifu by getting a facial this happened about two hours ago.

i've been extremely stressed as of late and my boyfriend wanted to help me relax. he flicked my bean and went on a minge binge to my little heart's delight. he even drew me a nice bath complete with warm towels and bath beers. i really wanted to show him how i much i appreciated all his gestures, so i thought a great way to do that would be to let him give a facial. i start doing my duties and all is rainbows and puppies. he gives me the signal and i activate baby bird mode trying to give him the best view i can. that's where the fuck up occurs. i tilted my head back slightly too far and ended up with a nostril full of semen. it took a moment for me to register what the fuck just happened, but by the time i figured it out, my other nostril gets its turn. at this point, i just sit there and take it up the nose because i'll be damed if i let man gravy get on anything. i immediately go to the bathroom afterwards to evacuate my sinuses, but i didn't get it all. not long after, i feel some slither down the back of my throat like a demented slug. i still have the smell of semen in my nose. 

tldr: a dick in my mouth ended with semen in my nose.

"for not paying for the extra meal i accidentally ordered at a wedding? my sixteen year old son and i went to a wedding. when we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. there was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but i never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. i sent in the rsvp card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

at the wedding, my son and i got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. the waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. the waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

i later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that i had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. i told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. they said i should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that i should have asked for clarification if i wasn't sure. but i wasn't unsure, i never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. ten and under i would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up i would never think would have a kid's meal. the bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but i've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. i think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. 

if i refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? i know wedding meals are expensive, but i think this was their mistake.",3

"my 36m wife 34f has been having an affair with her own brother and i realised our son might not even be mine. i dont know how or where to begin. this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

​

my wife and her brother has always been messing around, they were the type of siblings to take joking a bit too far (sexually). new people who meet with them have always said that they are the type of siblings who you would think are married if it wasnt for them being brother and sister.

​

my brother in law lives very close to us. he is divorced and has 2 daughters who live with his ex-wife. my own wife very often takes over our son to his place, and also very often visits him herself. this is something i never ever had anything against, after all they are brother and sister. it wasnt until recently when my 4 year old son told me mommy and uncle tommy (lets call him that) had been kissing on the lips that i got suspicious. apparently my wife had gotten angry at our son for no apparent reason for having seen this and she had told him grownups do this as a gesture of love.

​

now, i understand hugging or kissing a sibling on the cheek but in my 36 years on this earth i dont recall kissing my own sister mouth to mouth. that is just...disgusting to me. tonight i did something which i never done or felt the need to do before, and i checked my wifes phone only to find a load ton of messages between her and her own brother. most of it is just regular chat, nothing special. but after having scrolled through a ton of messages i find sections of intimate pictures between them, and even messages such as ""horny"", ""want to come over for a quicky"" and similar sentences. i am grossed out by the sheer imagination of my wife having had sex with her own brother, as this cause me to imagine ever having kissed any of my own sisters which is disturbing to say the least.

​

having sit here now thinking about what to do i cant do anything but to think my own son might not even be my own. so many times have i heard how ""he looks like uncle tommy"" and just looking at his face makes me believe this even more.

​

i am really at a loss at this point, i have no doubts about what she has done, but i cant imagine also having lost the only thing that meant more to me than my own life, my own blood, my son.

​

i feel like just jumping off a building or taking my own life if he ends up not being my child.

​

i want to divorce her, but i dont know how to go on about finding out whether i am the father or not, i really dont know what to do if i found out my son wasnt mine.

​

edit: after reading several comments i decided it is best to not confront her now. my wife has been asking me multiple times what is wrong and i just told her i am not feeling well. i can barely look her in the eyes at this point. the only reason i am keeping it together is for my son. i wanted to go and sleep at a hotel but it would just raise too many questions on her part, so i will sit infront of the tv and sleep on the couch.

​

edit 2: had no idea this post would spiral out and get this many responses, thanks i guess. i wont be reading more pm's, i have gotten way too many of them.

currently staying with my sister, i decided it was not a good time to confront my wife yesterday, so i just told her i will be moving in to stay with my sister for a few days as she needed help with some stuff. my sister lives about 30 minutes away from us. i have told everything to my sister and she thought it was best to meet with a lawyer. we scheduled a meeting today, he will be helping me with the divorce and has also offered to help me get a paternity test (read some comment about a guy who did a paternity and got the wrong result) which is why i will get it via a court.

i will be getting a divorce for sure, this is not something i will ever accept or can forgive. it's beyond f\*\*\*ed up. to the feminists out there who messaged me and told me to step up and forgive her, f\*\*\* you too.

i will confront her but i cant tell when, probably tomorrow. my sister wants to come with me, but i wont let her, i will head over there by myself and let her know what i found out, will see where it goes from there...

"my daughter (7) keeps getting touched inappropriately at school, school brushing it off (washington) on a near daily basis, my daughter (age 7) is getting groped by a boy at school.  she says he typically does it when the class is lining up and when the teacher is not looking, or at recess.  so far he has touched her butt, her chest, and proclaimed ""we should have sex.""

we talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  this has not helped.  we escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

the principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""  the read between the lines comment was: ""the boy's parents are not taking the issue seriously.""  the principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

we are really fed up that the situation is allowed to keep occurring and that our daughter does not feel safe.  it shouldn't be up to my daughter to ""cause a scene"" when it happens.  what obligation (if any) does the school have to try and correct this issue?",2

"i suspect my step-mom attempted to poison my dying dad's food. i managed to procure specimen in question. what do i do now? not sure if this is the right subreddit. sorry for the wall of text, but my head is spinning and i don't know what to do. let me break down some background first:

&#x200b;

my dad is currently dying of liver failure. he's in end-stage, at-home hospice care.  we have nurses and social workers that visit every single day in the hospital bed we set up to help care and clean him up. the man is incontinent and can barely move unassisted. he's taking light doses of morphine and lorazepam so that he can sleep. the consensus seems to be that he'll be lucky to make to thanksgiving....

&#x200b;

my step-mom has a very shady history....she has three dead husbands  prior to my dad from whom she collects monthly in the sums of many thousands combined.  there was a fourth man after that she got engaged to after a mere 6 months, who died under mysterious circumstances, and she fought to take as many of his valuable possessions from under the noses of his children as she could. (my dad would be the 5th man)

she's euthanized 2 of her own dogs and 1 of her own cats....herself. not through any vet or other official. she is barred from every animal shelter and adoption agency in the state as a result.

so with that pre-established pattern in mind....let me bring you to last night.

&#x200b;

she brought in a ""home-made"" tuna fish sandwich to feed my dad, because he barely eats anymore, and it's somewhat of a thrill when he requests something. he was lucid and alert, laughing and joking. in a matter of less than a minute after devouring half the sandwich, he began to have the most extreme reaction i've ever seen him have:  his eyes rolled back, he began to seriously convulse, let out a series of loud groans and moans....his face contorted, and he was completely unresponsive to all outside stimuli - lights, loud voices, touch, you name it. before i even put two and two together, she's asking him (a little too enthusiastically) ""do you see the light yet??? do you see all the pretty angels??"" (wtf????). he's been in an essentially catatonic state since. out cold for the past 12 hours. it was a transformation that happened mid-sentence as he was speaking. in tears, i begged him to squeeze my hand if he could hear me, but....no dice. i was truly scared and genuinely thought i was going to lose him right then and there. we called hospice to send a nurse over (instead of calling 911, which is what we've been instructed to do. they are on staff 24/7). she wasn't sure what the catalyst for this episode was, but she did say that his vitals were okay and that this is a normal part of the dying process, and that if anything, we will be seeing things like this more often, and that it could also possibly be the drugs.

but he's been on them for weeks, at low, very controlled doses, and nothing like this has ever happened. i'm just a lay person, but that did not seem normal, and it's very suspicious to me that it happened immediately following the food, like flipping a light switch.

maybe i'm crazy. maybe i'm reading too much into it.  but i managed to wrap up the other half of the sandwhich in plastic wrap, and keep it refridgerated. my first thought is to get it analyzed in some lab somewhere....but....where? is that even a thing? do i take it to the police and tell them my suspicions? a hospital?

with him being in the dying stage already, is it even worth pursuing??

&#x200b;

again, if it weren't  for this woman's history, i probably wouldn't think anything of it....

&#x200b;

any and all feedback would be much appreciated. i'll do my best to answer any questions as well. ",2

"for getting a family thrown out of a restaurant for underage drinking? throwaway account.  we were at a local restaurant last saturday evening. this is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. there was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  there was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. a beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. there was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

but as i watched i noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who i assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. in fact, i'd guess the 4th girl consumed most of the mom's margarita. i mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. full disclosure that i'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. so i mentioned it to the hostess. a short time later a manager (i assume) came and asked to see the girls' id's. the girl with her own drink produced one. the second girl who had been drinking from mom's drink did not.  i did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. i assume they were asked to do so.

"by realizing my history teachers gave me a horribly skewed version of what happened leading up to the civil war. i had 4 years of rotc in high school and 2 semesters of american history. (2 separate teachers) so, not a history major, but i have absorbed a lot of material on the civil war. and i realized today that it was horseshit and i got hoodwinked.

before that, like most people, when someone asked me why the civil war happened, my answer would have been ""slavery"". and that definitely was an issue. but my teachers presented it as thought it was not the forefront issue. they gave me a lot of info--what the economy was like and what other industries aside from slavery were doing, how industry was just taking off in the north, what europe was doing and why that was important, etc. --there was a lot. and it made sense, because i found it very believable that politicians and businessmen were doing underhanded shit and trying to hide it behind or around the slavery issue. so they essentially presented me with the idea that slavery was not the main reason for the civil war, it was business. again, super plausible. this was all being presented with an attitude of ""now let me tell you what really happened"". 

im six semesters of this shit, no one had even mentioned the declarations of secession, the actual physical documents the states wrote when they left. i had no idea they existed. i read them all today, and holy shit that stuff reads like a dystopian nightmare. they were all about slavery and how it was ""the greatest institution ever conceived"" and that it had to be protected. there's no way this wasn't the forefront issue, after reading those papers. i messaged some friends who had the same class to make sure i wasn't remembering wrong and, i wasn't. i told them of my discovery, they had never heard of the secession declarations either. ugh.

reddit let me know earlier how absolutely wrong i was. i don't care about people calling me dumb, i'll own that. i just trusted my teachers to give me facts, and i got this...propaganda. i am disgusted with myself for carrying around incorrect information for so long. i hope my stupidity is isolated, but i wonder how many people are out there thinking they know something but actually don't? 

tl;dr i thought the civil war was about slavery, my history teachers convinced me that it wasn't, then reddit proved them (and me) totally wrong as fuck.

edit: the fu part of this is that it took me making an ignorant post on a other forum and getting blasted by the reddit community about how completely stupid i was for me to learn about the documents, or the cornerstone speech. which i guess is fair, i dunno. it hurt my feelings, but it shook loose the truth for me.

"update2: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

tldr: my gf was raped. wanted to abort. talked to mother. decided not to abort. i left her. 

update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

tldr: gf calls me, reveals mum made her not get an abortion because god cares. she wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. some of reddit think i'm a baby killer.


i was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but i thought i should provide an update on some recent events from a mother from the pits of satan's rectum.

on saturday, i answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. they asked me if i was who i was, and i replied i was. they then said they were looking for my gf. i called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.

the officers then split, one taking the gf to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.

the officer who took me started asking me questions about how long gf had been here. if she had any contact with anyone else. if she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. i answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on gf. i asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn't say. 

after a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. the moment they left, my gf told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if i had been hurting her. she was also asked if she was being held against her will. she said no to everything, of course. she said that the police received a call from her mother saying she might be in danger, and that i could be abusive her.

i was fucking livid. i immediately said i was going to press charges against her - for what? i dunno. harrassment probably?

my gf begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to ""calm down"".

wtf? she sent police to my house to get me arrested. how is that sane thinking? i could lose my job if i was arrested and charged. what the hell is she thinking?

i told gf that if the mother does anything like this again, i will definitely press charges. so the gf decides on sunday to talk to the mum to not do anything like this again.

they had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then i start hearing sobs. immediately, i walked into the room, saw my gf was crying, still holding the phone against her ear. 

i plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as i heard ""hello?"" from the phone. then i put it on me, and said ""you're a disgrace of a mother"" and hung up.

then i held the gf for what felt like an hour before we started talking.

apparently, the mother was telling gf how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the mother again, or her brother, or her deceased father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat gf, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because gf would be going to damnation.

i told gf that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we'd be nice and toasty together. i love her smile.

what do you think, if anything, should i do about the mother? no doubt my words to her will have some reactions.


response to some people from previous threads and pms after thread was locked:

1 - abortion was never an option. gf was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her mother. and if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.

2 - you can believe my gf cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, i suppose.  just fyi, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck. cheating...right........

"for suggesting that my sister chose an easy love? my younger sister and i were very close when young but no so much now. i was born in fairly well to do hindu family. i fell in love and married a muslim man and had to convert to his religion. my family was pretty pissed off that i converted but we've kept in touch.

recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. my mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

my sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. i was happy for her.

it all began when i asked what religion he was. imagine my surprise when she said that he was hindu and the same community as our parents. this would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

i asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. she got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
i suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

i explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. it was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

she told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and i was being rude. i told her that i wasn't, i was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  i then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
at this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. at this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. she called me 'toxic'.

"my truck was stolen and later found but the police did not notify me until 6 weeks later, at which point the tow yard had already sold it at auction. wa state my truck ('87 beater, not worth much but very important to me as a spent a lot of time fixing it up) was stolen in mid october. i immediately filed a police report and checked back in several times with the police for updates, but was told if any tow yard received it the police would know and would notify me. 

fast forward to last friday, i receive a call from the police saying my truck was recovered... on november 1! six weeks prior! from my conversation with the very apologetic dispatcher, it seems like they messed up and forgot to notify when it was found, but never admitted to that explicitly.

i called the lot it was sent to, and was informed that per their policy the vehicle was held for 29 days and then sold at auction. a later phone called revealed it was sold on nov 24, after only 23 days, which i would think is illegal. apparently the towing company sends a letter to your address, but i had just moved out of my old place not 2 weeks prior to the theft and heard nothing. i had no idea it had even been recovered!

all i really want is my truck back, which i don't think will happen, but all of this just seems wrong to me. am i entitled to compensation? and from whom? the towing company sold it before it's stated 29-day policy, but the police made no effort to contact me. do i have legal recourse here?

i have tried to speak with police but cannot get in touch with their ""complaint hotline"" until tomorrow. same situation with the towing company.
any advice greatly appreciated.",2

"am i in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked? context. happened a few days ago. me and my boyfriend were staying in a hotel with his friend and his wife (we've been together 3 years). we were all drinking and after awhile his friend and wife left. me and my boyfriend had drunk sex and then went to bed.

after awhile his friend came back alone. my boyfriend got up which woke me up. i was half asleep, and heard the friend say something about my body. my boyfriend asked if he wanted to see. i was on my side away from them and heard them walking over. i panicked and didn't know what to do. was i suppose to jump up and let them know i was listening? freak out? (i have sever anxiety so this caused an attack). i froze and he lifted up the covers i was under. edit: i was naked 

i confronted him the next day but he says i wanted him to see me because i didn't stop him and he should be upset at me but is understanding and i should be too so we can let it go.

am i an asshole? can i not be upset because i didn't stop it?

update: thanks everyone so much for support/ advice. i've been with this guy forever and we were talking about starting to do foster care and marriage. i thought i was crazy and this wasn't as big a deal as i was making it since i wasn't touched or anything. i'd like to make an update after i talk with him again. when you make one do you just add it in here or make a new post? im new to this.

to everyone saying it's ultimately my fault for not doing anything, mental illness is paralyzing. i was sexual abused as a kid and this was the same way my body made me (or wouldn't let me) react. i wasn't sure at first but i know i didn't do anything wrong. 

i'm sorry if it seemed like an obvious answer. it's hard to accept these things when it's someone you had a future with.

more info: i am hesitant to tell the friends wife because they have a baby together. i know she should know the kind of man he is but it makes me think of how i went through divorce but then again would he be a good father to the baby girl anyway?

"by knocking out the guy i'm seeing this actually happened yesterday but i couldn't get a chance to post it.  

i'm a pretty ""basic"" white girl. i'm 21, i like starbucks, i wear leather leggings and hoodies, i'm blonde, i have a part time job as a secretary-- so it was not surprising that the guy i'm sorta dating didn't believe me when i told him i've been kickboxing for the better part of a decade. instead of going to the gym and jogging, kickboxing has been a way for me to be active and stay fit. it kinda pissed me off he thought i'm making it up to look cool in front of him because he's been trying to get into kickboxing-- so i figured, why not have like a fun date at the gym he's been going and kick the heavy bags and have fun.  

he kinda laughed at the idea but i made him accept.  

we got to the gym, i met his gym friends, his coach and so far it was going good. the dumbass jokingly said we should spar and that he'd go easy on me-- told me with sparring gear it wouldn't hurt and it'd be fun. there was no way i'm saying no to that. my plan was show him that experience matters and make him believe me that i've really been doing this for a looooooong time-- but no, the asshole didn't put on any protective gear. i got mad.  

we begin. he's laughing, his friends are laughing and cheering for me like i'm some kid-- and i'm just getting more and more pissed off by the minute. the cheering was the boiling point. as soon as my date got close enough, out of nowhere i decided to head kick him with everything i had. i literally grunted as i kicked him. in the ten or so years i've been kickboxing i don't think i've ever kicked anyone that hard. he was out cold before he even hit the ground. 

needless to say, when he came to his senses he had no choice but to accept that i've actually been kickboxing for quite some time-- i also invited him over at my place tonight and plan to make him dinner to apologize for the ko.  

surprisingly, he doesn't hate me and laughed it off-- and accepted the dinner invite which is a win in my book. 

tl;dr: my date didn't believe me i've been kickboxing for quite a long time and asked me to spar. i head kicked him and knocked him out cold.

edit; this kinda blew up and i can't reply to everyone! i know what i did is fucked up and bad and i realize how bad it'd look if the genders were reversed. i didn't post this to gloat and brag nor do i think he had it coming-- i thought this sub is about fuck ups- this was a fuck up on my part. i didn't realize this would offend so many people.

edit 2; guys, i can't stress this enough- i posted this because i fucked up. he's fine and his coach took him to the hospital. i'm really sorry if this came out as me bragging, it's on me for writing it up like this. i hope someone reads the edits because i can't reply to every individual comment.",4

"deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant. the update!!(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)

&#x200b;

ohhhhh where do i begin. this happened this weekend.

let's lay out some plot points first..

\-i'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. she is 26.

\-i work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. i've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-i've always worked out, done yoga, i'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. this combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. i've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. i know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, i've done it a lot and i know what i'm doing, lol.

&#x200b;

okay. so, the girl i am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. one of whom is getting married soon. she was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. i was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? i agree to the plan. i was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&#x200b;

there are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. this way, i would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. but the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (i can draw a diagram if needed.)

&#x200b;

so the day comes, i have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. by the time i arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. i prepare myself with the girl i'm dating, and she invites her friends in. they are hooting and hollaring as i'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. the whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, i'm really into this idea now.

&#x200b;

i throw my legs over my head as i've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... i circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. i put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and i hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. i'm trying to look back to see them, but i'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. i start getting more and more into it, and the girl i'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. at this point i'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. the girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&#x200b;

after a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""cum in your mouth! cum in your mouth!""... now to be clear, i normally don't do this. i have before, lol, but it's not my thing. but i'm the entertainment, and i aim to please, so in my mind i'm thinking lets do this. i start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. the girl i'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. the whole thing is so hot and i feel like i'm about to cum, and.....explode. it was a lot. i'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. the girl i'm dating let's go of my legs and i fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - i'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. so i stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and i look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. my assistant.

&#x200b;

she leaves the room, i race to the bathroom. the girl i'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and i tell her. she loses it laughing - ""so and so is your assistant?! ahahahah"". i'm not laughing. assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&#x200b;

it's actually a bit of a scene, the girl i'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling assistant and she is not answering. the girl i'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&#x200b;

i've been working from home all week. i've talked to my assistant via slack and we've said nothing. she is in the office. i can't work from home tomorrow. i don't know what the fuck to do. the girl i'm dating said that assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. i really don't know what the fuck to do.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - i sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. we haven't spoken about it since.

&#x200b;

edit:  the diagram(https://imgur.com/a/rr31ebi)!  i'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  i'm not a turkey, i promise.

edit 2: to clarify, i don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  i think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  the diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until i stood up.  at least this is the logic i am convincing myself of.

edit 3:  i'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl i am dating"" because honestly i wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  i don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

edit 4:  yes, they were staring at my butthole.  i'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. to be honest if,

edit 5:

since everyone is asking, i'll offer my thoughts.  no, i'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  it's my own dick, so i think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  by your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

as for the ""i've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i bring it back to the above statement.  a handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  i think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  but it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  better than jerking off that's for sure.

and yes, i have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

thanks for coming to my ted talk.",4
"a robber pulled a gun on the bank clerk and manager saying, ""give me all the money! i need it to set myself up in a trade or profession. you know, initial investment is needed to cover the overheads until my cash flow is established."" the bank manager said to the clerk, ""you'd better do what he says, i think he means business.""",0
"cardi b drugging and robbing men makes her a predator in a recently discovered online video, cardi b claims ""i had to go strip, i had to go, 'oh yeah, you want to fuck me? yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go back to this hotel,' and i drugged niggas up, and i robbed them. that's what i used to do. "" 

that is the work of a predator. maybe it isn't as bad as bill cosby, but as they both drugged people, the two can be compared. cardi b should not be a celebrated public figure.

as a stripper, you are already making way more than minimum wage. if you can't survive off of a stripper's salary, you should go ahead and crawl back into your mother's womb because most people survive off less. 

how many of those men overdosed from the drugs and never made it out of the hotel room? we will never know.

"update: for arguing with my wife over her preferring to sleep with a body pillow over me? https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/d8c3ic/aita_for_arguing_with_my_wife_over_her_preferring/

so a bit of a weird update since my wife actually saw this thread through her coworker. (e: to clarify, the coworker didn't know that it was about my wife, she was just sharing an interesting thread)

she texted me asking if i was looking to buy a new bed and i said yes without thinking much of it. she then linked me this thread and said we would talk later that night (not in a bad way).

we sat down and she apologized for calling me a baby and i apologized for starting a fight over something so small. 

she said that she really enjoys the pillow but we can get rid of it and sleep together instead. i told her this isn't necessary and that i would deal with it but she insisted. 

i've ordered her a new body pillow that just covers one side of her that she could put on the opposite side of me so hopefully everyone can be comfortable. 

everything worked out and we have been sleeping together for the past couple weeks now. the new body pillow came in and is on the opposite side of her. she switches between me and the pillow every now and then and it's not a big deal. a lot more comfortable to sleep now too haha. 


thanks to everyone who pmed me giving me advice as well as those giving advice in the comments. 

i tried to emphasize this as much as i could in the comments but seriously my wife and i never fight and this was extremely out of the norm for us. 

everything is good now though and we are going to start doing date nights again on saturday and it's been going well. feels more like our relationship when it was just starting out in the ""honey moon"" period kinda thing. 

but yeah, everything's fine now. to be honest it was always fine, this was just a minor thing that some how got blown out of proportion. i barely remember but i think we were both just stressed with work that day so we ended up getting into a silly fight. 

seriously i love my wife so hopefully no judgement by you guys on the one comment she said back then. she's honestly a really good person!

i made an update thread a few weeks back but was a few days early for the minimum and someone commented on the old thread a few days ago so i remembered to repost the update thread today with a few more updates.

thanks everyone :)

"my (29f) husband (31m) is no longer attracted to me after an accident that burnt my face. my husband and i have been happily married for 6 years and he has been nothing but a kind, attentive and caring spouse whom i love very much.

i attended a christmas party hosted by one of my friends where someone who had too much to drink decided to set off fireworks indoors. i was stuck on the first floor when the fire broke out and suffered third degree burns to my face and chest.

my husband has been extremely supportive and caring, helping me through all the hospital visits, the surgery and taking care of me while i recover. i just cant look at myself in the mirror as my face looks really bad and disfigured and i can tell he feels the same way too even though he keeps reassuring me it doesn't matter. he just looks differently at me now.

the other night we tried to be intimate for the first time and he just couldn't get it up. he kept saying he was sorry and that he still loved me very much but he cant help it. i know he meant it so i just cried myself to sleep that night.

the next week we tried again and the same thing happened. he then told me he wasn't attracted to me anymore and that he couldn't help it. it was soul crushing to hear that. he tries though. he cuddles me, hugs me, and keeps telling me it will all be all right.

is there anything i can do to make him think i'm beautiful again? but how how can i if even i don't think i am?

tldr: i was in an accident that burnt half my face off and my husband no longer finds me attractive",8
"muslim guy 22m whom i 22f multiply rejected over the years writes to my friends to find out about my virginity we have been attending the same university over the last 6 years and share a lot of common friends.

during the first year of uni, he has asked me out and i declined. during the years, i have tried my best to stay away (as much as possible), however, he interpreted every accident glance as my approval of his advances. i guess, in total, i had to decline him about 10 times or so.

however, during last summer i had made a mistake by replying him on one of his messages (just asking how i am). we have talked a little, and that's all. soon after i had stumbled upon him near my house. i confronted him again, he denied following me. after that i told him to stay away and blocked him in all social media.

it all has been silent until last month. two weeks ago my best friend told me he wrote her, directly asking  her if i have ever been in a physical relationship with a man. she didn't answer him except asking why on earth does he want to know such personal information. he did not reply.

today he wrote to her again, demanding a link to my (hypothetical) boyfriend' profile.

i lost my wits, wrote to him again, telling him to leave me and my friends in peace. he denied writing to my best friend, which is absolutely foolish. i have ranted and once again blocked him.

however, i do not believe this is the end. i am angry at such intrusion in my personal life and a little scared for my safety. i mentioned his religion because he came to our city from southern regions with very ""tradiotional"" views upon marriage and female consent.

he never seemed dangerous or violent in university, just a little slow to understand.

what am i to do?

update 10/07: i would like to thank everyone for your replies. a lot of helpful advice was given, i really appreciate it. the situation doesn't seem so unmanageable as before.

thank you and stay safe, everyone!",8
"instagram is ruining everything (a rant) i think that instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. let me explain:

1. **ig is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. while social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. no political or important dialogue is happening. i would argue that even pinterest is more worthwile since at least diys teach you something.
2. **ig is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** why we are all pretty much aware from our own instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **ig is bad for your mental health.** because unrealistic standards are set on instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in ig. this also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (see also this article: http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/(http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). i also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **ig makes people vain.** taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. it's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. this makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **ig gives the worst incentives to people.** the reason i am ranting right now is that i saw a vice video about a poppy field in california that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for instagram (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka)). they then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". so these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. this shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. now i don't think that they are inherently bad people but i think that instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

i would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. so just to clarify, i do think that one can use instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. what i wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. and while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives i feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. i do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. however, i feel that while some good instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",6
"update: my bil stole my kittens and sold them. police aren't helpful and new owner is not budging. do i have any recourse?

"for grounding my daughter the way i did? so my 15-year-old daughter wanted to go hang out at a friend's place (call friend hannah) and go to the mall and then stay at the hannahs place overnight, i knew the girl and the girl's mum so i agreed. 
she packs her bag and gives me a hug and leaves. 

at around 10 i decided to text hannah's mum to ask how it's going and she gets super confused at my question, i said you have my daughter right? she goes no, hannah is with her dad this weekend i have no teens with me atm. 

so she calls hannah's dad to sort the situation out and he tells her that he is still at work and hannah should be home alone. 

i walk over to hannah's mums house and we drive up to hannah's dads. 

turns out hannah and my daughter wanted to get drunk and throw a house party with older guys, i was seeing red at this point and grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out.

 when we got home i made her hand over her phone and laptop which she has lost the privilege of having for 2 weeks (exluding school work) and she is banned from going to the shops with friends for 2 months.

"one of my relatives is ""homeschooling"" her kids, but isn't actually teaching them anything. her oldest is 2 years behind now. nearly 8 years old. is there anything i can do in texas to report her? i heard texas has pretty lax homeschooling rules. by 2 years behind, i mean that she has admitted to not teaching the kid. she has stated herself that if she were to put the kid in school they'd have to start 2 grades behind. there are other things in their life that support this. but i don't exactly want to give out too many details. my question is simply that if i suspect she is neglecting her child's education what steps could i take? i don't care about your opinions on right and wrong. if i have legal steps to take then i will. if not, then i won't. that simple. having interacted with the kid and other kids that age, the kid is behind in so many ways. and no, their mom isn't teaching some odd curriculum. she just straight up isn't teaching her kids. she is like a very hands off day care for her own kids.

no she isn't doing what ever that unschooling stuff is. she just isn't teaching. she says she doesn't have the time. she is a stay home mom.",2
"for not accommodating a vegan guest? longtime lurker here. hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.

so my wife (29f) and i (29m) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we've lived in our current city. we like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. we have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it's become a great tradition in our social circle. 

our friend james started dating his girlfriend sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that sarah was vegan. i thanked james for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. he agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. everything was fine, until now.

during our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. my wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn't push the issue. 

however, after the meal, james took us aside privately and told us that sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. he added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

my wife feels terrible that sarah was so upset and apologized to her and james profusely, but i don't agree that we did anything wrong. i like sarah very much as a person and i don't have anything against her dietary choices, but i don't believe it's fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. for the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. aita?",3
"keep a separate master resume with all previous work experience. when sending out a resume for application, duplicate the file and remove anything that may be irrelevant to the position. you never know when some past experience might become relevant again, and you don't want to forget about it. edit: wow, this blew way up. and my first time on the front page too. 

i guess i can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what's worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. most american employers/career help centers i've met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won't go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

a few people have mentioned latex. i use latex often in my math coursework, but i'm not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. pages (on mac) has been sufficient for me.

as far as linkedin go, it's a less-detailed version of the master document i keep, as far as work experience goes, but i go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on linkedin than i do on paper.

"by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. my brother and i have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). this agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so i was convinced he still remembered.

a couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. i got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. i decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. there's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. so i went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""brother's name, if you're watching this, i'm already dead. everyone on the world pretty much is. it's been about eight months since you went to hospital name. you need to head for the safe haven in helsinki (we live in western canada) - mom might be there. god speed."" i managed to sync it up to the tv and woke him up as it was starting.

this is where it all goes to complete shit. my brother began to lose it immediately. he started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. i grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. nurses came in and i was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

he got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. my mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. my dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. i'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. i've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

worth the wait though.

tl;dr: convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital

edit: wow this blew up?! i don't have a ton of time but:

1) i don't want to upload the video. i made it sound tamer than it was, i look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xd

2) the tvs in the hospital had hdmi ports. i just plugged it into my chromebook. 

3) i can see why people say i made this up for karma, but i didn't create a throwaway to do that.  if i cared that much, i would've posted it on my main account.

4) my mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. she hasn't been happy with me moving (western canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. she paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",4
"by sleeping with my landlord okay so this happened over the weekend and today. 
on friday, i went to view an apartment. i had talked to the landlord on the phone and was seeing the apartment with the super. 
so i see the apartment, everything's great, get an application, fill it all out and email it to the landlord. 

i get a call from him a few hours later, just going over details of my application and he offers me the apt. i'm going to go in on monday to sign the lease. 

okay so now it's saturday night and i'm just swiping through tinder and match with a cute guy, mid 30s, (im 20). let's call him steve
he messaged me, we flirt, he comes over to my place. we have mediocre sex at best, then he leaves to go home. 

so monday rolls around and i go to the apartment building to sign the lease and tie up any loose ends

i walk up the building and steve is standing outside with a woman and i see he has some papers in his hand. 

the woman waves to me and introduces herself as steve's wife. steve looks totally chill, while i'm freaking outside but trying to remain calm. i did not sign up for this. 

anyway, i feel bad for his wife and i feel like a horrible person even though i had no idea that he was married.

"by leaving thc chocolate out and sending my mom into orbit on edibles my cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of thc chocolate for christmas, because he'd mentioned that maaaaaybe he'd want to get high. my parents are 75-year old republicans. that was a big maybe.

&#x200b;

well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. you put half a candy bar down and yoink, gone when you come back.

&#x200b;

you can guess what happened. my mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. her last words, high as a kite, were ""i think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&#x200b;

they took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. at which point i assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the redbull orbit jumper.

&#x200b;

anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. so now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

obligatory gold edit: thanks all for your well wishes! ! a few things to clear up - mom went into the hospital on saturday. as of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in manhattan where she awaits surgery details. i'm in canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but i'm planning to head back down to ny this weekend to be with her. also....op is not a dude. :)

second update from my dad: mom's surgery may be thursday, with the holidays and all. i decided not to mention that i put the story on the internet.

fp edit - thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. i'm headed back to the states on thursday, the tentative surgery date. will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

update - mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. all of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

check out my adorable mom

"i m32 matched with my wife f29 on tinder... big time throwaway account.

i'll start by saying that my wife and i don't have any sort of open relationship agreement or anything of that nature.  

we met on tinder 3 years ago, fell in love fast, moved in together, and got married. we've been married over 14 months now, and quite happily, i would say.

a month ago she left on a business trip for a week and i found myself downloading tinder on a particularly lonely night. i don't even know why. i didn't have any intentions. but i did it.

i swiped here and there and got pretty bored with it. it was a funny reminder of that time of my life. i deleted it and moved on.

on monday my wife left for another business trip. last night i once again downloaded tinder and started swiping. again, i had a laugh, but ultimately was bored of it. 

then i saw her picture come up.

i say shocked for a moment. i wondered if i should just delete it and pretend nothing happened. i thought maybe a bot stole her picture.... but i read her profile... it's her. it's her now and it's her live. there's even a picture of her where i am cut out.

i decided to make a bold move and swipe right. 

i swiped and we matched.

she gets back from her business trip tomorrow. i'm going to confront her then. i don't even know how this is happening. she's over 100 miles. is a friend of her using her account??

now i have to explain why i was on tinder. this is just a huge can of worms that got opened.

what the hell do i do?

tl;dr - i matched with my current wife on tinder",8
"by instead of sucking the dick, the dick suck me today my cousin bought an 8 inch black realistic suction cup dildo as a birthday present for my brother, whom in horror discarded the obscene dingus. being the saint that i am, i adopted this orphaned device. 

my friend and i provided the poor discarded ornament with a purpose, i replaced the toilet roll holder with our new trinket, which worked fabulously. 

however, the mere potential of comical joy to be experienced was wasted on such a mundane destiny, and thus i proceeded to stick the suction end to my forehead and become the unicorn i was meant to be... i had reached my comical peak. as we cackled at the flailing 8 inch dick upon my forehead i could feel something was terribly wrong. 

i heard a loud squelching pop as the large appendage detached, my friend looked at me in horror. upon my forehead i had been crested with the biggest hickey possibly to have existed in the past millennia. the curse spot consists of a large darkening purple oval of approximately 6cm by 3cm. 

i leave for italy in 8 hours for my summer holiday.... my friends won't be able to look at me in the eyes. i fear for what the security at the airport may think of my battle wound. 

tl;dr: stuck an 8-inch suction-cup dildo to my forehead, now left with giant hickey hours before i depart for venice...

but if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness.

"i (21f) had sex with a guy i met on tinder last night (25m). to me it was entirely consensual but about 10 minutes after he was crying and telling me i took advantage of him while he was emotionally vulnerable. what in the hell do i do? i guess some background is in order, i met this guy on tinder about two weeks ago and we sort of chatted back and forth, we had a dinner date on wednesday and agreed to meet again on saturday. i did know that he had a recent break up but he told me over and over again he was ready to get back out there. 

so last night we had a great time. we ended up going back to my place and one thing led to another and we had sex. the sex was actually really good and he did most of the ""work"" so again i had no idea he wasn't into it. so after finishing i was just telling him hat i really liked him and would love to do it again but the mood just somehow just changed. 

at first he started saying he shouldn't have done that. i was like ohhhhhh-kay but whats done is done so lets just go back to being chill since we both enjoyed it. then he started crying and started basically verbally attacking me that what i had done was the equivalent of ""male-r@pe"" and that i knew he was vulnerable but i'd pressured him into sex anyways. i told him that i was really sorry but i saw it differently. he ended up getting dressed and ran out. he was crying so loud and so intently i could actually hear him in the parking lot outside my balcony sliding glass door. 

he drove away and i haven't heard anything from him at all. i am so lost as to what to do. 

1. should i call him and apologize? even though i feel i didn't do anything wrong?

2. should i call him to check on him but not apologize, and maybe just explain my side of the story?

3. should i just swayze him and say i've dodged a bullet?

4. should i actually contact the legal services department at my school in case he was serious about the ""male r@pe"" allegation?


thank you so much for the help!! i'm so lost!

tl;dr: was basically accused of taking advantage of a guy i met on tinder. i'm lost as to what to do next?
 

edit as of 840 az time: he just called me. he was very stiff and said he wanted to talk about last night. i said i wasn't comfortable with that and very confused. he kept trying to goad me into talking and i asked sort of joking ""what are you recording me or something?"" and then he hung up. something tells me i stepped in a huge pile of shit. my dad is paying for me to consult with a lawyer first thing tomorrow...wow that was a hard conversation to have. 

well if i become the first female #metoo you saw it here first.

"for not letting my wife have mothers day after she ""canceled"" fathers day? so, this is a little strange of a situation but hear me out.

&#x200b;

i've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. i love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. she is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  i will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). one of her big beliefs though is with holidays. she still celebrates holidays with the family (christmas, easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the ""money"" side of things. we're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.

last year in june my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. i was a little hesitant but i agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.

well, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. all of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. i obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. all of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. she's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. we fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.

"forbidding my wife from using my daughters old room this has been an ongoing argument between my wife and i, but it resulted in a huge argument today and i'm starting to wonder if i'm in the wrong. i think it's impossible for someone in my position to see my wife's point of view fairly so tell me who's the asshole here. i'm also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it's solely this topic/argument that i'm interested in hearing your judgement on.

so my wife and i have two kids together. but before i met my wife i had a daughter with my now ex-wife. my daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. we haven't said a word to each other in almost a decade and i have no desire to speak with her anyway.

i still own the same house as then and i've pretty much left my daughters room as it was. at first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it's kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? i can't really explain the logic behind it because i don't think there is any. it just doesn't feel right to change her room.

this has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and i have really had. the house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there's my daughters old room. my kids know not to go in there and it's just left there. occasionally i will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. it's therapeutic in some weird way.

my wife has always wanted to change the room. at first it was because she wanted a study, but i refused and eventually she gave up. 

we're now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. again i put my foot down and said that wasn't an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.

 she really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. she was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. she was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. she said a lot of things but i think that basically sums it up.

when she said these things i was really hurt. but i've had a few hours to think it over, and i think i might be the unreasonable asshole here. it's not fair to make my kids share a room because i won't let go of the past. it's not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn't my first love.

thanks everyone for your support. i actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. i didn't know she'd be there. she said hi to me like nothing was the matter. like we hadn't spent 2 years of our lives together. she looked great and i wish i hadn't gone to the party. i was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. but seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

after the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. she said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when i was gone and realized that she didn't want to be with me. just like that. she said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she's an introvert). she said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

i said that's fine, but she could have at least told me. she apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. she said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

i just think she got tired of me and didn't even care enough about me to end it properly. so she just decided pretending i didn't exist was the best way to do it.

"for kicking my best friend out and telling him to grow up after he called my baby belly gross and weird? i've known james since we were 11. he's been my best friend for a long time and we're so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike and even share a last name. he lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. 

i had a crush on him growing up and i asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. he always declined and said we were just best friends. he's really goofy with me, and treats me like i'm his little sister and over time i came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. my parents treat him like a son and honestly, he's family. 

a couple months ago i had a ons and found out i was pregnant. being as i have pcos i am over the moon because i was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. i am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and i cant explain how many tears of relief i shed. i've always wanted to be a mom and finally i have a chance at this. i have my own home, have savings, i'm in the right place in life and i'm so happy. 

when james found out he was also over the moon. he thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. won't go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn't feel like going to the mall, can't come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. 

my mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one i cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. he confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. he said 'i know it's really weird of me but it just creeps me out' 

i found that so demeaning and hurtful, and i burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to gtfo. he apologized and left and i haven't heard from him since. i'm so upset that he's ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump! i want to reach out but i just feel so .... alienated from my own body and made to feel gross and i'm not sure if i'm the one that's being difficult or if it's him.",3
"it has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34f) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. i (35m) am seriously considering a divorce. happy update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy\_update\_it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy_update_it_has_been_7_months_since_we/)  


title may seem harsh so i apologize. also using a throwaway because my friends know my real account.

bit of background info about my wife: she's an only child and had a rather lonely childhood. so to her, having kids and watching them grow up together is an important issue for her, if not the single most important issue.

to make a long story short, 7 months ago we learned that my wife is incapable of having children. of course both of us were devastated and she ended up leaving her job. for the first month after learning this terrible news, all she did was cry and watch netflix in bed. i brought her meals in bed, started working from home, and gave her my full support because it was the least i could do.

but now it's 7 months later and she's still crying and watching netflix in bed all day. i ask her every day if she needs anything but all i get in response is variations on either ""leave me alone"" or ""some peace and quiet"". virtually the only times she gets out of bed are when she fixes herself some snacks, uses the bathroom, or takes a shower. i do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry. i've suggested many things to help her recover, including but not limited to:

1. therapy. she said that all therapists spew bs back at you.
2. adoption or using a surrogate. she shot down both saying that it just didn't feel right to her.
3. moving to her parents' city. she said moving 100 miles was too much stress.
4. buying a corgi puppy (corgis are her favorite). she snapped at me saying that a puppy is no substitute for a real human child.
5. taking her on a weeklong trip to anywhere she chooses. again, she said that's too much stress.

earlier tonight i had a talk with my wife. i told her that our relationship is just not sustainable if she continues to act this way and that she needs help. she said that she's fine and called me an asshole for suggesting that she get help.

don't get me wrong, i love my wife with all my heart. i'm doing my best to help her, but she is refusing that help and in total denial. i know that she'll be devastated if we get a divorce but honestly i cannot bear living like this for much longer. what do (or can) i do?",8

"just like ""don't shop, adopt!"" movement for animals, there should be a huge movement of ""don't reproduce, adopt"". i feel we already have enough population. and it's not doing any good! like lets be practical here. more than 70% of the world is struggling to meet their basic needs. 

i'm sure our dna is not that amazing that we need to preserve and pass on from generation to generation. it's not like if you don't pass on your genetics, world will loose something valuable. (grammar)

not reproducing but adopting can bring a huge change in this world! 

edit1: well this went out of proportion. rip my inbox. 

some clarification about my opinion. no i am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. and now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. so stop saying, hey i'm from norway and i don't want to adopt an african child. your country have zero orphanage?
it's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries.

no i'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
i'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
but if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

and someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man! 

edit 2: getting a tons messages from the  people who were adopted. 
you guys are amazing, yes some of the replies on this post are harsh. but a lot of them are positive as well. we can always look on the brighter side. love and respect to your parents who loved you and raised you like their own.

to answer the endless messages i received about race, i am white and early 20's, the person i was misidentified as is also white but in his 30's.

i spoke to my boss and hr and will be back at work very soon and 2 months pay advance that will be paid back with ot. also my landlord was really nice and is letting me pay the back rent over the next few months in installments.

"my wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary tl;dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. brought flowers to wifes office. found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

yup. tl;dr  says it all. my (35m) wife (35f) and i were married ten years ago yesterday. she has been working on a big project for the last few months. the last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. this is a career maker for her.

 i work construction. with the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. so i work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. if its raining when i get up i dont go in. somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. i usually hit the gym for an hour or two. thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. we go home. i go to the gym as usual. i cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. we really havent seen much of each other this week. i went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. not unusual for past month. 

i stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. nichole was at the receptionist desk. i told her i got here later than i wanted could she put the flowers on mehgans desk. she said ""i dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" she buzzed the door to get back to the offices. the place was deserted. i went to her office, the door was closed . i always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. i walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. she is giggling only as she can. saying""we got to get this done"".  i am gut punched. i slammed the flowers down said ""happy anniversary"" and walked out. i didnt hear what she said just went past nichole said goodbye and left. made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

i balled my eyes out all the way home. went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. i drove about 2 hours to a state park. i had no idea what to do . i just had to run. i hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. i dont drink much so i had no booze, i just sat there thinking. looking back i am glad i was in a rush, normally i bring a 45cal. with me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. the way i was feeling i might have ate the barrel that night. my phone was blowing up fom mehgan so i had turned it off. i left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. i called him back. he said meghan called him to check on me, make sure i didnt do anything stupid. we talked a bit, told him i got to think this thru, would catch up on friday.

so while i am thinking about this, i go over our marriage from the beginning to see what i missed. we come from completely opposite backgrounds. my grandfather raised me with my mom. he taught me about life. he had a little saying about everyhing. he told me marriage would be the hardest job zi ever had, you had to work on it everyday. god i miss him. we did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. they worked hard and my brother and i did not miss out on anything we knew of.

mehgan was born into money. not overly rich but very comfortable. went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. and she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. i would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  we met hit off started dating. i was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. we dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. her dad and i started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

she graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. we work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. i took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. we agreed we had to experience the others interests. she was really enthused about the more physical things we did. i kinda like the symphony and such. i own two tuxes now.

i look back and do not see any red flags. her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. she was paraded out in front for photo ops. invited to conferences when other newbies were not. at dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. she quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . this 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. she seems very happy. we seemed very happy. 

so now, friday, i am home. i called her. asked where she was, back at work. i being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. she responded since i would not talk what was she to do? fair enough. she will be home in an hour. so i wait. i want to save our marriage. if i am lacking in providing then i want to fix it. i want to ask why of course but i can not accept  a idk answer. how do i phrase this? what else should i be asking? i know i will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  what she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. thank you in advance.",8

"by sending nudes to my employee group chat. tldr at the bottom- 

well i recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). with that being said i'm pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. i also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

we have a groupme for the store i work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
the previous night i had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that i was with at the time. no biggie right? 
the next morning i had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. noon rolls around and i needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue i was having with a computer i was working on. 
i typed what i needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as i clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, i hit send without thinking and go on about my day. i should also probably say that by this time i was working alone and closing so no one else was around. the customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left i went to check my phone and saw i had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first i thought he was just calling me about the question i had, while the phone was ringing, i went back to look at the groupme, to my horror i clicked not just a picture from the night before, but the whole damn video. my heart dropped, instantly when i realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my ""intentions"" where with the video and that he's never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. i tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. lol on the bright side the coworker i had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 


tldr: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out i send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end!

"for not wanting to break up with my girlfriend/stepsister? first of all, i know how that sounds, but it's really not like that.

my girlfriend and i were childhood friends turned high school/college sweethearts. we are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. we are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. the same home. because our parents are married.

it's my mom and her dad. both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. when we were in hs we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and i being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.

honestly, i hate being in this situation. even though i know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says ""go tell your sister x"". i think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. my (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to ""what did you expect from the crazy bitch?"" but i see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. my girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. we can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.

this living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. i love this girl and have spent my life with her. i want to spend the rest of my life with her. i just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.

aita? are we all bad? is it inappropriate no matter what to date your ""stepsister"" who you live with?",3
"my daughter is dying of complications from cancer. my wife and i don't agree on final interventions. how do we come to an agreement on something as profound as this? i apologize if this doesn't come across coherent. too much ugly crying.

we have been battling cancer for many months now. her liver has started to fail and despite all efforts we have been told by the doctors that short of a miracle she will likely die within the next 24hours. eventually we are looking at a few possible situations at the end. either her brain will stop working and she will die that way. she could also reach a point wher she can't get enough oxygen without intubation. the other option is she goes into cardiac arrest.

if she goes into cardiac arrest they can attempt cpr. we have been told that due to the tumor growing in her spine chest compressions will likely break her back.

if she needs to be intubated it is quite possible that the process would cause so much damage (she has already started bleeding in her lungs slightly last night) that she would essentially drown in her own blood.

both interventions we have been told have a low chance of surviving. even if we do she could have brain damage from high ammonia levels. on top of that she is still battling stage 4 cancer of a cry aggressive kind that will still likely kill her.

i don't want either of these interventions as i feel she has gone through enough. my wife wants to do any and all interventions needed. i don't want her to suffer any more.

i don't want my wife to resent me wanting this. we have tried to talk about it a few times but haven't come to an agreement. a part of me feels like a pos for not wanting to try anything but i just don't want her to suffer anymore if we only get a few more weeks/months.

what do i do to find common ground. i tried asking a social worker at the hospital last night but didn't get a great answer on how to find a compromise. perhaps someone on here has gone through a similar problem and can help with some advice.


edit: thank you for the advice everyone. my wife and i have agreed on a plan. we are looking at the final few hours almost certainly. please support childhood cancer research. no parent should have to go through this.

2nd edit: i appreciate all the advice and i want to give another update. firstly, my daughter is only 5. i don't believe she is capable of truely understanding her death. either way this all happened rather quickly. last week she was getting a few hours outside of the hospital and enjoying life. she was very alert and still strong enough to walk around with help. her liver failure is a  due to a rare condition called vod which came on her very quickly. within the span of 24 hours she lost her ability to communicate with us due to toxic levels of ammonia in her blood. 

she does still have a chance, albeit small, to come out the other side of this. the medicine to heal her liver just hasn't had enough time. she has already been intubated before a couple months ago and came out fine. 

my wife and i decided to try intubation again but say no to cpr. she was intubated a couple hours ago. so far she has stabilized and at the very least she is much more comfortable now due to the sedation than she was before being intubated. both my wife and i are ok with the decision and have agreed to no further interventions. 

thank you everyone for your love,support, good vives and prayers you are sending. we'll take all the positive energy we can get.",8

to preface this, i (24f) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. i have not eaten meat since i was roughly 3-4 years old when i found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). this is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so i thought. 


four nights ago, i was at a party and i will admit, i got white girl wasted. my friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. i checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" to which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). they tasted off to me but i figured it was just because i was drunk. i was wrong.

"boyfriend and i slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out this happened in ontario, canada.

so this past friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

i found out about it the next night at work (i work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and i were the night before. he filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

for more context, on the 24th of october a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. it has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (i sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

all we asked for was the alarm for our unit. luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

i dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. my dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. but i don't know. came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in ontario. 

edit: more direct questions; should we pursue action and report? if we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? i know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. i could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

tldr: boyfriend and i were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

well my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and i had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as i had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. so i went into the bathroom and began to pee. as i was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all i could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. i looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. i started screaming ""oh fuck!"" and managed to pinch off my stream. the kitten didnt seem to mind getting wet via golden shower, but as soon as i pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. this all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.

it took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. i set her in the tub and i had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. i got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. the last few nights i've woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. i dont know what shes planning, but i'm sure she'll get her payback sooner or later.

my girlfriend thinks it's the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she's still a little salty that i pissed on our new kitten..

tl:dr - i gave my first and hopefully last, golden shower.... to my new kitten...

"my friend's mom only lets him sleep for 4 hours every night. is this child abuse/neglect my friend (grade 11) says that his mom only lets him sleep 4 hours per day, based on the idea that he needs to study more. even when he has no upcoming assignments or tests, he is only allowed to sleep between 1 am and 5 am. if his grades do poorly, he is allowed to sleep less, since his mom thinks that he must not be studying enough. is there anything he can do about it?

"aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why i have missing fingers? i have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. it's fine. i can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days i can't, that's the dyspraxia). however, i won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. i only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

i'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but i still find it annoying. i really don't get why you'd think it would be an ok thing to ask someone about, but hey. i wasn't raised in a barn. usually i nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

anyway, i started a new job about a month ago, and i honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. i felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and i decided to make myself laugh. when the first new coworker asked about it, i completely lied and told her that i chewed them off as a baby. i then decided to tell the next person who asked that i cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that i was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. all genuinely ridiculous reasons but i'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. i didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. maybe they just thought there's no way i'd lie about how i lost my fingers.

within about 3 days, i learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. i'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3d printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

anyway, i told this story to my brother today and he told me that i was an asshole because i caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. my argument is that i'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because i didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, i was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think i actually severed three fingers with dental floss when i was 3. i'll accept my judgement, though.

update: gonna check out here, i think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. a few reminders for people: i'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",3
"a former air bnb guest put a hold on my mail for everyone at my address and has been paying to hold the mail for 2 months! (texas) its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  one guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  a lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  one lady missed the receipt of a death certificate.  we thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  so i tried calling the usps and that got me nowhere.  going down in person was the only way to do this i guess.  turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal po box?  who knows.  the post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  still, how could this have happened?  surely this can't be legal.  i got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  she hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one. 

edit:  well that was quick~!  the post office called me directly before i could even report her and pro-actively already reported this lady to the postal inspector.  they're very certain what she did is illegal.  thanks /u/beamdriver for the advice!  important lesson here kids:  don't fuck with people's mail, because the usps apparently is the most effective law enforcement agency there is.

"by swiping on my girlfriend's phone nsfw so this happened a few days ago and i'm still not sure i'm 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

i've been with my girlfriend for about a year and i already know she is the love of my life. she's perfect for me. we're perfect for eachother. we're getting ready to move in with eachother and i want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

we went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

she went to the bathroom while i had her phone, and as i was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. if you have an iphone you know what i'm talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you're back at the start of the photo album. it's annoying as hell.

but some photos caught my eye. some photos that i really shouldn't be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

there she is, the love of my life, trying to get her mouth around the biggest dick i've ever seen in my life. i've watched porn - a lot. i've never seen a dick like this. i'm talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. longer and thicker. as far as i could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

i could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

i closed the pictures and i've acted like nothing has happened, but i cannot get these images out of my mind. i've never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats i'm significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

we haven't had sex since. i can't concentrate on my work. i just wish i had never seen those damn pictures.

tl;dr accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

okay. i'm the type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. so i waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, i honk. she then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which i already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. each time she makes an attempt to order something i honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. we stopped as soon as she drove off. we then ordered and went about our day.

"my husband constantly bodyshames me. i was around 5'1 and 100 lbs when we got married and six years later, i'm 5'1 and 125 lbs. he constantly comments on my body and my weight even though i've never asked for his opinion.  i know my body isn't perfect, but i'm working on accepting that. 

actual things he has said to me

1. (a day after i gave birth and was getting dressed in front of him) - *disgusted tone and expression* ""is your stomach going to stay like that?"" by the way it takes two weeks for the uterus to return to normal size

2. ""it's not baby weight when the baby is two years old.""

3. ""your thighs are huge. when you sit down, they look even more enormous""

4. ""it's like you've lost the weight everywhere except for your hips. it's very noticeable from behind. i'll even take a photo and show you so you can see for yourself how fat your ass is""

5. ""i'm just motivating you to lose weight. 
who else is going to tell you that you're fat?""

6. he even has a game he plays with our three year old daughter: 
 ""who's the tall one?"" - her: ""daddy""
 ""who's the cute one?"" - ""me!""
""who's the fat one?"" - ""mommy!!"" and they both laugh at me. okay haha very funny.

7. ""why do you keep trying on clothes if you're never going to buy anything? you keep saying it doesn't look good on you but the truth is that thin people (he meant women) don't need to try on clothing because they look good in everything. so maybe just lose weight before you go clothes shopping again.""

8. ""short and fat isn't a good combination""

and so on. on average, he'll make 1-2 body shaming comments a week. i've talked to him about it but he says he just wants me to be healthy and fit. it's hurtful, and unhelpful, and unhealthy for my daughter to hear those comments from her dad about her mom.",8

"for serving myself the biggest piece of meat? my boyfriend and i have been together for about 2 1/2 years. we live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. we have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. i wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but i do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when i can. bf doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. 

for reference, i am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. he is a 5'7 170lb guy. 

on sunday i went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. if you're familiar, it's 13er james peak in co. it was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). i had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. suffice to say, i was pretty hungry by dinner time. i made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. when it came time to eat, because of my big day, i grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. we're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. 

bf got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. he told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. i told him that i'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. 

he told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. i said that i agreed, but again, i'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. he told me i should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. 

we've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). so far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. i think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general.

"when baking cookies, take them out when just the sides look almost done, not the middle. they'll finish baking on the pan and you'll have soft, delicious cookies. a lot of times baking instructions give you a bake time that leaves them in until the cookies are completely done baking. people then let the cookies rest after and they often get over-baked and end up crunchy, crumbly, or burnt. 

so unless you like gross hard cookies, take your cookies out of the oven while the center is still gooey. i'm tired of people bringing hard cookies to potlucks who don't even know that their cookies are actually burnt.

"co my ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. she now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. i want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible. me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. there were a variety of reasons for this that i wont get into here. one of them though was her anti-science beliefs. she's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200b;

we have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. my ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. and threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200b;

around this time i also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. when this happened i decided i wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. the only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. my ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. the judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200b;

ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" i demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. so, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. she somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. i have been stressed out from the minute i got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. my daughter must have picked up on this and thought i was mad at her because when i was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200b;

turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. she made my daughter lie about it. instead she has been using ""special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" what about the forms i got saying she was vaccinate? there fake. i called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. so my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

i'm pissed to say the least. my daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. my ex doesn't know i know yet and i told my daughter not to tell her, i want her gone now. how do i approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. i have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. i also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones i have a forged. i'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but i would like to know going in what to do. thank you.",2

tldr: my family helped and we're getting her evicted. 

i think rm is crazy and needs a mh checkup. seriously. i am very worried for her wellbeing. 

my mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. i told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. my mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

when my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. i've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
my mom called rm and rd and r to come over to talk. they came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. she made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and i could tell this was pissing rm off. some points of the confrontation:

1. why are you calling my daughter these names?
rm: i didn't say anything. she's making        up lies. 

2. why are you even in the apartment that much? you told us that you go there once a month to check on r. you also said she visits you every weekend?
rm: the kids don't know how to cook, so i help. also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. why are you going through my daughter's stuff? why does she need a lock? why are you limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*i shall also mention that roommate's dad was sitting in their car on the driveway during this whole confrontation*

but things got heated up really quickly. rm started insulting my parents:

- she said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said i am unruly and that the clothes i wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). this annoyed my brother, and he showed rm ig pictures of r wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. rm shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- she then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""god complexes"". this pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" this pushed rm off the edge, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted to slap him. 

this lady tried to slap my 24 y/o brother in front of my parents. 

they argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. this time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. she came back to where we were standing and literally threw the dress in my face.

my mom had no more patience left, and back slapped rm across her face. i've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and i burst out laughing. even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of rm. rm started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

when they left we had a big discussion:

my parents were angry that i never told them about this before. they said that they got me that apartment so i could do what i wanted. they wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
however, they are very proud and happy with the way i dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. thank you all for the advice. i appreciate it alot. ❤

they were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of r cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

my parents agreed that letting r live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. my parent's started the eviction process today. 

anyways, it may be hard to believe, but i do stand up for myself a lot. it's just that in this situation, i didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because i had respect for their friendship and i didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. i learned from this, and i have growing up to do, but now that i know i have support, i won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

i also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't indian). no one is living rent free in this situation. 

i would also like to say that even though i wasn't friends with r in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

also my parents are liberal ass indians. they have lived here in america for over 40 years. they didn't want to spy on me at all. they don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

edit 1: i forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, i don't think it does. i'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. also, it's my parent's money. they'll do what they want. this gives me no excuse to have a gpa less than a 4.0, js. 

edit 2: i took out the part where rm tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  it was funny though. 

edit 3: i added a tldr. 

i included most of the important points. if something doesn't make sense i'll reply in the comments. 

the cops are yet to show up. 

edit 4: guys we forgot to ask for the key back. fucking damn itttt

"by going blind and posting in r/pics by going blind and posting in r/pics 

a friendly redditor u/kevindavebob suggested i post on so thank you for the great idea (and for being nice to me). this is certainly a and it all just happened so i'm still feeling pretty terrible about it.

i have a rare disease called usher syndrome that is causing me to go blind and deaf. one of the ways i cope with having this disease is by traveling whenever i can to create visual memories before i go blind. i went to iceland to try to see the northern lights. i can't even begin to describe the feeling of actually being able to see the northern lights. i didn't know if it would be too late for me to see them. 

i really wanted to share my story about going blind and seeing the northern lights, hoping to generate awareness for usher syndrome. only having a phone camera and being a very amateur photographer, i certainly can't capture the beauty and experience of witnessing the lights. i was able to find a public use image on the internet that would properly convey my story and experience. the photo has been linked so many times that i didn't spend time searching for the original source (you can see where this is going….).

with my genuine caption, generic photo, and source to my story and blog (no ads) in the comments, i posted in r/pics. i chatted with a few kind redditors about my story and was really happy to see people learning about usher syndrome. then i went to sleep….

well, all hell broke loose.

my post made it to the front page of r/all. #1 in fact. i woke up to thousands of hurtful messages and comments – calling me a liar and telling me i don't have my disease, redditors telling me they're happy i'm going blind if it is true, that i should kill myself, etc. (there were some way worse ones i won't write here).

i wish the mods took my post down while i was sleeping but it made it to the front page and stayed up for some reason despite reddit telling me i was a fraud. it then got posted to r/quityourbullshit where i got even more hate. i didn't say it was my picture, but i didn't credit the photographer. i seriously fucked up.

i can't even tell you guys how upset all of this made me. living with usher syndrome is not easy. there is no cure and it's terrifying losing both my vision and my hearing. my vision especially. i want nothing more than to try to raise awareness for usher syndrome to discover a cure. not just for myself, but for everyone else who also has to live with this rare disease. 

i was so focused on my mission to raise awareness and share my story, i didn't make the effort to credit the photographer the way i should have. i fucked up reddit. 

i am getting so much hate now, even outside of reddit from people finding me on my blog and other social accounts just to attack me. i'm sad that my post which intended to raise awareness for usher syndrome turned into fuel for such negativity. we have too much negativity in this world and it's got to stop at some point. 

thank you to everyone who was understanding and realized i made a mistake. thank you luke stackpoole for making your beautiful photo free for the public to use. i'm sorry for not taking the time to find you and credit you before. your entire portfolio https://www.withluke.com/ is stunning.

from the bottom of my heart, i am sorry for misleading everyone and not posting correctly on r/pics.

i really did fuck up, though. 


tldr; i tried to raise awareness for usher syndrome by posting a picture on r/pics and failing to credit the photographer, luke stackpoole. my post made it to the front page and reddit now hates me.

edit: a nice redditor (u/omichandralekha) suggested i share the non-profit that donates to usher syndrome research so here you go (no need to click on it if you don't want to, it just takes you to the homepage of this non-profit where you can learn more about it all) - the usher syndrome society: www.ushersyndromesociety.org. also, full disclosure: i am on the board of directors and it's a pretty amazing organization!",4
"lpt if someone is acting like they don't care about you, believe them. edit: i thought that my point was obvious, my mistake.   

if there is anyone in your life, at any capacity, who straight up acts as they don't care about you, you should take their actions at face value.   

for example, if you a friend who always is being a dick but you rationalize it by saying ""uhh yeah- it's just an act, deep down they are nice"", then stop. you should assume that they mean they way the act, and not seek deeper meaning.",9
"should i tell his wife that he is banging hella girls at my job? long story short. this married guy with 3 kids had fucked probably 5 women at my job. i denied him because he was married. but i did and was texting him there for awhile until he sent me a dick pic! lol anyways wife found my number and text me if i had slept with her husband i told her ""i"" did not. she is asking me for more answers! i want to tell her about her scum bag of a husband then part of me is like is this my place to say? 
update!
hey everyone update here! so i decided not to directly tell his wife what was up but sent her some clues to who his husband is cheating on her with. wife is updating me with details. wife bought hubby a new phone and dumb hubby forgot to delete messages on his old one! found out he was cheating not with one co worker but with 2 at the same time 😂 anyways wife thanked me. hubby has to go to marriage counseling because they have a 3 month old baby and 2 other children and she doesn't have a job. so she can't leave him is what she is saying as of right now. also douche hubby has to quit working at the place we work. problem solved!

"for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food? i'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. i've lived there for 6 years. my neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (i actually don't know her first name but i'll call her katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. we exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

so i don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, i don't have as much money for takeout anymore. i'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. i'm gaining weight and i never feel great.

this is where katie comes in. i can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (i know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). i've even complimented it a few times. so i got the idea that i'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or i can pick it up from her!) at night. she's cooking anyway and then i'd have varied presumably delicious food.

i asked her the next time i saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). the next time i saw her a few days later, i asked her if she was sure and upped the amount i was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and i should get a housekeeper if that's what i want. she also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like i was being creepy (i wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). i think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

so, aita?

edit: people keep assuming i'm sexist because i didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. it's not an assumption for me. he and i have lived across from each other for 6 years. the cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and i've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

edit: okay. it is abundantly clear that i was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as i hate to admit it, creepy. my instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, i'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. thanks.",3
"for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes? first up please know i am trying my best to be kind in my wording. i run a small operation where i guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. i have served all kinds of clients.

i got an inquiry for a group called ""womens+ adventures"" and because it was during pride month, i thought maybe it was an lgbtq+ group. i chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and i started the training plan.

the group wanted to work up to ""a 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. going off what everyone reported, i decided gray's peak. one of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

when i arrived for our first group hike, i learned ""womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than lgbtq+. no issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

the first hike was... awful. it was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. when we got started hiking, it was very slow. one woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. one ate all of her snacks after the first break. lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

after we got back (6 hours later) i pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. she insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that i didn't believe them. when i suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. i gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd hike went even worse. i had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. so i called the head and told her that i thought it was best if i refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that i am fatphobic, i'm mocking them, etc.

please, please keep in mind that i have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. i consider myself to be very patient. one of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

i refunded the money and ended contact only to find my social media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. you can guess what i was called. i felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me i was an asshole for not powering through, that i should have given them three chances, that i should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

"i(f32) just found out that my husband(m36) has a full blown secret family because his ""other wive(f29) "" just knocked on my door. sorry if this sounds so vague and incomplete. i am confused and my eyes are all swollen up

i thought that i had a pretty happy marriage with ""jonas"". we have been together for over 11 years now and married for 9. we have twins (f8).

jonas works in a branch of business were he spents 3 months outside and 3 months at home. during this time he will visit us and we will visit him. it is i convinient but he earns really good. so good so that i needn't work if i didn't want to.

during all those years i have never suspected him if cheating. he was always ""super honest"" with me and would even tell me about attraction to other people he felt.

so this comes all of the blue for me. jonas is away on a business trip for the weekend.
a woman knocked on my door. she introduces herself as ""cherry"". when i asked her what it was about she broke down crying. i took her in and after calming her she started to tell me this story about jonas. apparently she and jonas have been together for over 6 years and have a little boy (3)together.

we were both fooled because he keeps his life there completely separate from our life here. he has 2 different sets of social media accounts. and as his parents sadly passed away in a car accident 15 years ago he didn't have to introcude either to them.

at first i was livid and screamed at her. till i calmed down as she was just a victim.

apparently chery found out my(our) husband has an apparemment that was paid for by the company (were he would take me if i visit) trough some bank statements. she searched his keys and went snooping. there is were she found out about us and decided she wanted to tell me the truth after thinking for over 3 months about it.

we both cried our eyes out together. cursed out jonas and now she is sleeping on my couch.

she is not legally married to jonas as he sold her the ""i don't believe in marriage spiel"". the only legal spouse he has is me. i know i have to divorce him but maybe i just need some extra advice and a little husband roasting. also should i keep in touch with chery and should we introduce our kids?

edit : i guess reddit only takes stories serious if it has happened over and over again.

thanks for the few helpful advices i have gotten and a serious fuck you to the people making fun of me or calling me a troll. i honestly thought that someone would listen to me here but i guess it's if i wanted that i needed to have better grammar and a less crazy story.

thanks for the people that did tho. cherry has left and i will pick up my kids from my sister's right now. i will be leaving the house for a few days to get my ducks in a row and begin legal proceedings",8
"by eating a free gumball.  

i'm 23 years old, and i admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways.

earlier today i was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. during that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, i thought i would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

i checked four candy dispensers; all empty. one last chance. i opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, i find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. without any thought or inspection, i excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. at the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face…someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine's dispenser.

so there i am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as i spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. i'm certain i looked ridiculous, and i'm still brushing my teeth.

&#x200b;

tl;dr  i ate a free gumball which turned out to be fucking paintball. wtf",4

"i(22m) recently discovered my dad (50m) choose me over my former stepmother and half-sister(17f) 6 years ago. don't know how to process this. i was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. when i was sent to live with my dad, i was broken. i barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  i wasn't mad or angry. i was null of any kind of emotion. basically i was alive but wasn't living. i kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. i was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. i was more social with my dad but i kept it to a bare minimum.  i had noting left to say to anyone. it took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. that's how withdrawn i had become.

dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  when i experienced night- terrors, i would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  he drove me to all of my therapist appointments. he made sure i was eating properly. there were days, i would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. he literally went above and beyond for me. i hated the city that were living in. because  i had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

i was so passive, it was scary. my therapist had told my dad that i was stuck in the victim's cycle; i didn't know how to get out. because of this, i was bullied quite a bit. by the time i was 15, i had been to 3 different schools. it got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. i was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. noting would motivate me.

looking back, dad did spoil me but at the time i wasn't aware of it. i was so in my own body that i barley acknowledged my surroundings.   if i asked my dad for a new bed spread, i would get me new one plus new furniture. my phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. i was grateful and thanked him. i did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. again i was being polite. i didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. i barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

by the time i was 16, dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. i didn't question it. he had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. i didn't think it was any of my business so i didn't press the issue. a year later, dad had divorced my stepmother. one of dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in boston and he took it. we moved and i felt i was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. that year was probably the best year of my life. i was coming out of my shell. there was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. it was if i was like everyone else. i felt ""normal"". i became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, i was going out more. us moving probably saved my life.

because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. there was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. you could just sense it. it got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

me and dad have always been close. when i had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, i could see my dad crying in the crowd. i lived with my dad while i attended college ( i still do for the time being) . ever since i was child, i always wanted to be a doctor. well, i just finished my first year of medical school. honestly, i feel like a normal young adult in society. i have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom i've been with for 4 years. i'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

recently, i got fb message from my half-sister. she was apologizing a lot and i had no clue what she was talking about. turns out, the reason why dad and i moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what i was watching her change........... yes. she told her mom that i was watching her change.. at the time, i was traumatized of sex. heck i was terrified of any form of intimacy. the kid was envious of what dad was doing for me. she was so envious that she tried to move me out. well i guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and i'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. because we moved out, i think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. how can someone be so cruel? what did i ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. i didn't even respond. more importantly, dad never let this to get back to me. chances are if i had heard about this when i was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. it also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

this is a lot to take in and i have a new found of respect and love for my dad. he gave up this marriage for me so i could live a normal life.dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. i'm missing him a lot lately.

should i bring it up to him when he returns? also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? at the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and i almost want to help.

tl;dr: dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. dad kept it from me for 6 years. should i bring up with him?

edit: i wasn't expecting such a huge response. i just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. it will take some time but i will read all of them or as much as i can. as i was going through the comments, i found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. this a part of my life. i don't normally like to talk about about this . aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. the fact the people are saying that it's fake.... i don't what to say. it's not my place to try and convince anyone. believe  me, they're times i wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. when i wrote this, i wasn't thinking about syntax. it was more just getting this out. people questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. forgive me but i wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

as for how i became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; i did respond to it in the comments but i'll post it here too. 

""it was very unorthodox how i became valedictorian after attending a real hs for only a year. my overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because i was in online classes for my previous hears, i wasn't eligible at the time. i met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

i broke down in front of the coordinator and i told her the truth. being named valedictorian was something i always wanted. to be that would have been my first accomplishment that i would have achieved based on my own merit. yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. it wasn't trying to be valedictorian financial reasons. money wasn't a problem (dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. this would have helped me self-worth as well.

the girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and i told her the truth. she actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. it something i'll forever be grateful for. that's actually how me and her became friends."". not many people would do that and in hs. 

i'll be posting again. i just need a few days.",8
"my brother stole almost all of my inheritance and spent it on food and games. what actions should i take against him? hello. i'm a first-time poster, and i'm also on mobile. i am 19, and i currently live in new york city.

my parents died when my brothers and i were young (eldest was 11, second (the brother in question) was 7, and i was 5). they left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. i turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. it was in march 2019 that i finally got it. it turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. i decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. i wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. i called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after i deposited the money. my savings account has also been taken from. i'll admit, i really should have been paying more attention, but i was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and i got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. we tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. he had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

when i confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. he spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. i know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. it's just line after line of uber eats, postmates, and game purchases. my grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence. it would take years for him to make that money back on minimum wage. should i call the police and have him arrested? is there any way to get that money back?


edit: okay, i've decided to call the police and sue the bank. i know how to get my hands on bank statements, and i'll record him confessing to the theft. but i don't know how to hire a lawyer. where do i start?

edit #2: okay i just figured out how he got ahold of my account details. my grandma sends him to the store with her atm card sometimes to get money. he memorized her card and pin, found the account shared with me, and took from it.

edit #3: thank you so much everyone for all of your concern and advice. i got a ton of messages and i'm trying to answer them all, sorry if it takes long.

i've managed to convince my grandma (after a long arguement about this potentially ruining his life) to sue the bank for negligence and speak to a lawyer. we're going to see if the court would be willing to send him a mental institution instead of jail. haven't gotten him arrested yet, but i told her if need be, i would call them myself.

i like to clarify my grandmother's intentions on protecting him like this. my mother committed suicide right after my father died, and my grandma felt responsible for not helping her or seeing the depression that had taken hold of her. she explained to me that she knew something was mentally wrong with my brother, and was trying to ""make up"" for ignoring my mother's mental state by shielding him. she had no play in stealing my inheritance, other than giving him her card and pin under the assumption that he was just getting money for her since she can't easily walk to the store and use an atm.

edit #4: so i went to the bank. because he went through my grandmother's account, the bank says we have no claim. no case to sue the bank with. there's nothing i can do to get the money back. i'm ruined financially. all i can do is sue him and put him in jail, but i'm never gonna see that money again. i'd like to thank everyone once again for their help, and i'm sorry if i haven't responded to your messages yet. also, thank those two people who gave this post silver and gold. this will be the last edit i make, hopefully.",2

"for making fun of my boyfriend's penis upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). in the privacy our relationship, i playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. however, he has complained in the past about how much he hates ""locker room moments"" when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not. 

so the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. one of the cues was something like, ""things that are short"" and i write down, ""my boyfriend's penis"". they were all read aloud and when its revealed that i wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. my boyfriend tries to brush it off ""oh you got me! ha ha"" and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him ""oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro!"" more laughter.

after we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. he said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. he said that by making that joke, all i have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. he wasn't mad, just disappointed. he said that he would never make fun of me if i had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me i was beautiful no matter what. 

i felt really, really bad when he said that. i have apologized and things are fine now but i think that maybe he is blowing this out of proportion? am i the asshole or should he maybe not take this so seriously? ",3

today, they were flying from tn (i don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to houston, tx, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   he had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (brooklyn, ny) and in texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which i will request from his doctors tomorrow)  he also brings a printout from the tsa about traveling with a port and cancer which i will find the exact link to when i get more info.  

my parents arrive 3:45 to a tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
both parents have tsa pre and get on line at about 4. they are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  the agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the id, etc.  my father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. meanwhile i assume he is not speaking his best english, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. i'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which i think adds to the confusion. they wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. they don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  they go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   my father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  he calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  he tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (his first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) they take him into a small room away from my mother. he is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  the agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. the agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  my father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed his parents and most of his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  i have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. he couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

he tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115-25 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) the agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   the agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. my father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  they bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  they wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  they agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  they take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. he asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. by this point the plane has left.  they go to the er to see if port is damaged and for pain medication.

he has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  my father is in incredible, needless pain, in a strange city hospital.  port is ok but they want to check him out again before flying.

i would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. if he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? they have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. i am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so i have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that i can go over with her later, so i'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
my family is very quiet, i don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  i would if that is the only option, however.  i don't know if it's relevant that we are muslim, either, i assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  my father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  he doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  i would love some advice.  apologies for length.
edit- i do not know if this is correct flair, if you want me to change it please advise.",2
"by letting my girlfriends dad use my laptop nsfw so today i had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, i'm still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn't make one hell of a story for you all

okay so for a bit of back story i'm 27 and i live with my girlfriend, we've been together for 2 years now and through out that time i've seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they're usually travelling so it's a little harder to spend time with them. now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and i for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. we've also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....

so on top of making porn i'm also an aspiring film editor and i am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but i also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us i'd been editing a new video, usually after editing i go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because i'd always got the vibe they didn't like me very much. we were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, i immediately said sure and led him into the office, now i could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and i kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. so i lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as i opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst i ejaculated on her face, if that's not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

i panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn't want her dad getting us sick also.

her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and i are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but i hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and i'll keep you updated if anything else happens 



tl;dr i unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won't talk to us

update: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so i'll explain, as i said earlier in the post i watch the video post editing to make sure there's no problems before uploading, before going to sleep i just shut the laptop without even thinking, i do this often (i know it's not good but sshh) if you don't stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. still haven't heard from her dad yet. i honestly didn't expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and i laugh a lot so thank you

update 2: thank you all for participating in a social experiment stay tuned",4
what are some recent scientific breakthroughs/discoveries that aren't getting enough attention? ,1
"by agreeing to an ""open relationship"" obviously a throwaway. 

to put things into perspective, i (m 20) and my gf (f 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

we decide to spice things up a bit and ""open"" up our relationship a little. it was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole ""sex is fun"" idea.

she is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she's met a guy (m 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn't working at the time. i agreed. i tell her to go for it, and she does. she texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

the week after, she mentions she's meeting up with this guy again. wasn't expecting it but i'm cool with it. again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. a decision i would live to regret. she doesn't text me the entire night. weird, but okay maybe she's just having a good time?

the next day i receive a load of messages about how she needs a ""break"" from ""everything"" right now. meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. a little more conversation and we're over. she's completely cut me out of her life. i check her snap chat story, and of course, she's with him. i've heard from her friends that they're dating now. 

tldr; agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me.",4
"if you're buying a home printer for occasional use, get a laser printer; they're more expensive up front but way more economical in the long run. edit: wow! front page! i'm on cloud 9 right now. 

to answer the most common question, inkjet ink is exceptionally expensive and priced that way because the company's got you where they want you by selling you a cheap printer. laser printers use toner which is more expensive to replace, but lasts longer. inkjet ink dries out when it's not used and is wasted. kinda like running the engine on a car when it's not being driven. 

as for photos, many people have pointed this out and it's a valid concern. many laser printers do an excellent job on photos and they're getting better, but ink is still king. you still have options. 

i mostly despise how the companies are gouging consumers. ",9
"by taking lsd and pretending to be french for 10 months throwaway for reasons.
tl;dr at the bottom.

so this was more of a fu that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

about 11 months ago i moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until i could get the money together to sort something out properly, i was hoping to have already moved out by this point. on my second day after i'd finished unpacking i decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, i'd brought some with me that i'd recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and i quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than i had been told they were, and i thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn't helping me relax. so i figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because i was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

so i left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. it's a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door's door is about one meter away from mine. i'd not met anybody on my street yet and didn't realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. she said something along the lines of ""hello nice to meet you, my name's (her name), are you new to the area?""

so basically i do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where i pretend i can't speak english. i remember a few words from my gcse french so i just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. in the state i was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and french just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. my exact words were ""je voudrais une boulangerie"" (one of my favourite lines to use) and i shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. she pretty much just left me to it after that and i got on my way. i did my walk and got home about two hours later, i was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. when i got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. i tried to keep my head down because i couldn't handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said ""bonjour"", so i instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. when i got in i started freaking out straight away because i realised that i'd just become french and now two of the neighbours think i can't speak any english. the next day when i woke up i realised the best thing i could do (as an englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be french for seemingly no reason. 

fast forward 10 months, i still live here, and at this point i'm in deep. my life on this street is a web of lies. i've perfected my french accent and over the course of 10 months french me has learnt a decent amount of english so he can hold disjointed conversation.
i'd gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and i was the nice quirky french guy on the street. i didn't let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation i had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered i wasn't french. if i had friends come over (i don't have many so it wasn't too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. most of them found it amusing, at least. 

things were going okay and i wasn't too worried about being exposed anymore because i'd gotten so used to it. i'm not home that much and when i am i rarely leave the house for any reason so i only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when i was out on my street. if anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when i got to take on my french persona. french me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his english was a bit limited.

but then there was the day it all came crashing down. i was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her i didn't recognise. she stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend ""this is f7tj78, the guy i was telling you about"". you might be able to see where this is going. 

her friend hits me with a question in french that i didn't understand a word of, and i knew he was actually french straight away because his accent was way better than mine. i didn't know what to do and i just froze. every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause i just decided i had to come clean. i told her i wasn't actually french and couldn't speak french and then i tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke i'd been doing on everyone. nobody was buying that. i fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

i haven't spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which i'd  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. i make sure nobody is around now whenever i leave the house, and i do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when i get home so that i never come into contact with them. every time i think about the day i was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

tl;dr: pretended to be french to avoid human interaction on lsd, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a french man.

edit: i didn't think this post was going to catch much attention, and i'm praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. some people seem to have a hard time believing that i thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, i'd like to remind people that when i made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",4

"by teaching my 4 year old about static electricity so it was rather cold today and i put some nice, thick wool socks on my 4 year old son.  after running around a bit today, he came and gave me a hug.... zaaap.  

i explained to him that he's got to pick up his feet because dragging them on the carpet will build up a ""shock"".  my son looks at me and says ""like pikachu?""

a bit of background.  a few months ago i discovered that disney now has the full run of all pokemon episodes.  like 20+ seasons, each of over 40 episodes.  my son and i have slowly been working our way through them, like 3-4 episodes per week.  my wife and i decided to get a switch as a family gift for christmas, along with let's go pikachu.  for my son's birthday a few weeks ago, we got him a pikachu plushie as that would fit in well.  

so a bit after my talk to my son about static electricity, he goes to his room and grabs his pikachu plushie.  drags his feet all the way to the office where my wife is playing frostpunk and says ""donder shok!!"" while zotting her with a nice snappy static shock.  

as he runs away, clutching his plushie, all i can say to my wife was ""i think pikachu's been teaching him some tricks"".  she was not amused.  



tl;dr - pikachu taught my son thunder shock.  my wife is not happy about this development.

"american ""left"" vs right politics is ultra toxic and how they have you riled against each other is just a means to keep the 2 party system alive and well. they way i see it supported, on here not just the media, is like how people support sports teams. you all seem to just want to trigger each other pretending that your ""left"" is against all guns or that all conservatives hate gay people. as such seeing a responsible gun owner will make democrats angry and an inclusive senate will upset the conservatives. 

it really perpetuates the ""well i have to keep voting x or y will get into power"" mentality. i believe it is stirred up deliberately to make sure there will never be a viable third party.


also, you guys dont have a left, you have a less right, so leave it out.

he realised that he had ran out of razor blades, so being the loving wife that i am, i offered him one of my unused razor blades to tide him over until he can buy more on the mainland.
he commented that he didn't want to leave me short, and i assured him that that wouldn't be the case as i use an epilator on my legs and underarms, and only shave my foo-foo when he's due home. cue my daughter walking into the kitchen at that exact moment and awkwardly making eyecontact with me before walking back out the way she had come.

"international women's day should focus more on improving the quality of lives and education of the women who suffer the most versus western feminists patting each other on the back for being women. the people whose voices need to be heard the most are the voiceless women who suffer under patriarchy and poverty. i will not deny the achievements and accomplishments of women that have pave the way for future generations - they should be celebrated - but i personally feel more accomplished striving for the equality and success of women who have way less than i do in my western comforts. it feels a mockery to not focus on what we can do improve their lives say for example the yazidi women's only commune in the aftermath of isis. my comments do not refer to the #metoo movements or other similar topics.

"update am i in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked? edit: his friend messaged me and said i had no right to ""make"" my boyfriend tell on him and refuse to see him. i haven't replied but this does show me my boyfriend is trying 

when my boyfriend got home i told him we had to talk, he agreed. i was going to tell him how messed up this was and i am telling his friends wife but he talked before me.

turns out i don't need to tell her because he already did. she was upset and asked him to never contact her or her husband again, so i won't know where that side is going.

he apologized and said it was a drunken mistake but he knows that doesn't make it right or hurt me less. we had talked about 3-ways before with women and he didn't think i minded, but now understands i didn't agree. he said he never thought he'd do something like that and he attacked me so much when i confronted him because he knew he was in the wrong but didn't want me to think of him as that guy. he was completely remorseful and i even saw him cry for the second time in 3 years. he said he thinks maybe it was some drunken pride thing over not being able to do much with me. this is because he does have some erectile dysfunction problems and i have had to help him with his self esteem as he would often say ""i just want to be able to please you"" when we could only have sex once every few months 

even so, he went to his parents for now. we had moved to a new state together two years ago where they live but i don't really know anyone. i'm looking at plane tickets to my hometown. 

until this incident we have had a perfect relationship. we always hung out and had great times. only once did we ever have a huge fight, little disagreements but nothing crazy. he did everything he could no matter how annoying or hard to help my mental illness. he wanted to pay for me to go back to school. he believed in me and supported me when i started my writing. he helped me come to terms with my abuse and move on. all the nights he stayed up with me while i cried.

i wish this never happened 

i don't know if we'll get back together but he's giving me my space and being respectful. i definitely need to be away from him for awhile and think about this. he says he'll give me all the time i need and if i can forgive him he'll be waiting for me. 

thanks everyone for the help in getting me through this time 

to all the guys messaging me to say it's my fault and i should be happy he wanted to show me off; i hope your dick gets so dry it falls off

edit: just to add about the drinking. we had a problem with this before where he'd get drunk and act very angry/ rude towards me. going as far as insulting me. we talked about it and he no longer drinks regularly. we just drink with friends now so i definitely think that is a big part of it. this was a couple years ago. it also showed me that he is willing to change for the better to keep us going. but this is also a lot worse than just being a drunk butthead

i also saw the conversation and made sure it was between him and her so i know he was honest about what happened with the wife.

my boss calmly assured her that i was working on a different application and all productivity is monitored (i get my shit done) she then, not wanting to be wrong i guess, doubled down and was upset i hadn't communicated that to her. i didn't even know. my boss asked her to elaborate on that and she brought up the application again and i guess they talked in circles for a bit. he let her know that he takes these matters seriously and asked her for any examples of me not communicating. she had nothing. 


when i spoke to my boss, at this point i was upset. i finally just told him what happened and explained what happened yesterday. he was not pleased. he did let me know i don't have to explain myself and that next time if i'm in that situation to go straight to him. he offered his condolences for my loss.


as for her, she is no longer allowed to speak to me. anything work related must be done through the messenger we have or email. though, he assured me that as we are working on different applications, she shouldn't be reaching out to me. she has a laundry list of people to ask before me. he told me to document everything. anything she does say document it for the time being and be as curt as possible.


today, she hasn't been around me. she even moved her monitor and keyboard so she's facing away from me. she hasn't said a word all day. it's been a wave of relief for me.


tldr: coworker tried to report me for something stupid, it didn't work. she is now not allowed to speak to me.

"'happy' is one of the most annoying songs ever written. it does not make me happy and i don't want to clap along. it's honestly one of the worst songs on earth. i'm sorry to anyone that likes it but i just can't stand it. it makes me feel really angry when i hear it. that and 'roar' by katy perry, which has been played more times on every single radio station than every other song combined it feels. both of them make me want to rip my own face off.

just my opinion, you're welcome to disagree 

what songs do you find super annoying?

what's the difference between ea and my uncle? my uncle didn't take my money when he fucked me.,0
"""money can't buy happiness"" is the biggest bullshit statement of the past hundred years. for almost every normal person in the world, money can buy happiness. the only case where this doesn't exist is with people that are severely depressed to the point that nothing matters anymore. for almost everyone else, a new car, house, medical care, medication, etc is what they need to be happy. ""money can't buy happiness"" seems to be something invented by people who have never had the pleasure of experiencing what it truly means to have enough money to do and buy what you want.",6
"mi, usa considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now i have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear i have a big family, with around 20 cousins,  10 aunts and uncles, and several others who always show up to family  reunions. i'm a male in my 20s.

last weekend we had a family reunion in a cabin resort in the woods. on the last night there, while everyone was sitting by the campfire, my uncle (by marriage), snuck up behind me and blasted an air horn about a foot  or two away from the back of my head. this air horn was not a normal little one you often see at sporting events. this campground has bear  around, so they keep several large air horns around the place to be used to scare off a bear in case they get too close.

as soon as he did it, everyone called him an asshole and got angry at him. he showed no remorse whatsoever. he laughed about it, telling us how he and his friends from work have blown air horns at each other before as a prank.

i was so furious when it happened that i didn't know what to do. i sat there quietly stewing in my rage for a while. i wanted to beat the shit out of him or hold him down while i emptied half of the air horn directly into his ear. but instead i  walked away eventually and spent the rest of the night in my room. it's important to know that this uncle was hosting this reunion. it's a ""corporate retreat campground"" that his company lets employees use.

he clearly knew he fucked up because he attempted to apologize the next day, but it was a pretty shitty apology. while everyone was sitting down for breakfast, he snuck up behind me, put his arms on my shoulders and quietly said, ""i heard your ears were ringing. sorry about that."" he didn't even say it to my face, or say it loud enough for anyone else to hear. i grumbled something about ""it's okay,"" but i absolutely do not forgive him.

this happened last saturday, a week ago. for the first couple days my ears were literally sore, and any loud noises were painful to hear. since then, my ears have been constantly ringing. it's the worst when i'm in a quiet environment, like  trying to work or go to sleep. i hear this high pitched sound that is driving me nuts. sometimes it'll start to subside, but it still comes and goes. i think i could have permanent hearing damage.

this  guy has been giving me shit since i was a young kid, so this was not a one time occurrence, though this was definitely the worst thing he's done to me by far. i've contacted a personal injury lawyer in my area to learn about my options, but i figured some people here might have good info as well. i won't hear back from the lawyer until tomorrow at the earliest. any info is appreciated. suing my uncle would tear a huge hole in my family, but i really don't care about that if i end up having a ringing in my ear for the rest of my life. it's interfering with my ability to sleep and work. thanks for any help.

"yesterday, my(33m) wife's (34f) best friend (female) contacted me and told me that her husband and my wife were having an affair and my 3yo daughter is actually his daughter. wife and i have been together since high school. married for 10 years. i'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. 

my wife's best friend megan and i work for the same company( different departments ). so yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. so i met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. i tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. 

according to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. she confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. 

and when i confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when i told her that megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. 

i really don't know what to do. i mean, everything was a lie right? my little girl taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. what do i live for now? i just don't know what to do. just here for some advice. i'm sorry if this felt like a rant.",8
"if i ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty? my wife is pregnant with our daughter. initially we were really happy and excited about it. but then, she starts acting like a nut job. she gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food i make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

for example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. well, i made chicken sandwiches. so she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. i wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. but if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? when i asked her this she told me that she was hungry. ok fine. she does this every time. eats everything i make and calls it shit. i don't argue with her because i work for more than 80 hours a week and i really want to have some peace when i'm home.

so, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if i wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. i rejected her and told her that i was married. and when i got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. when i asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. so they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. and i passed. yay!!. i'm really pissed. i'm done with her antics. if i ask her to move out?

"meta: this sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world i've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and i feel like i've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. over time, more and more of the posts seem to have a- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and b- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

given that, i think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

so just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

they'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. they'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

the internet has its own values, and that's fine. but in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? people who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? people who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? the people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

so yeah. i love this sub, i love reading the stories and i find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. but i personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people i know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. i don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

so even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. and maybe this is just me, but i really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. that's a discussion worth having too.

edit: thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. and lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

edit 2: wow, this got very big. it's gonna take me a minute to read all this. 

and alright guys, maybe the one about not ever wanting to socialize with coworkers outside of work is more of a thing in my field, not a universal experience. academia blurs the line between personal and professional like nobody's business, so i might have a warped view on this one.

"update: hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. building management's negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (to, canada) link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

first i want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and i are quite happy with. i've been very active on reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. it has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. i digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

through the advice i received on this subreddit, i contacted the city and the health department right away. i was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. the more we spoke the more interested he became. he called and asked me ""if i were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would i be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?"" to which i replied ""150%"". he then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, i said ""no."" 

shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. i went out and asked them why. they told me they were instructed to because they don't want people panicking etc. i told them they were to leave it there as i have called the city and they are on their way. they didn't seem happy. as if the whole floor isn't already in a panic anyway. literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. i also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. i have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. this lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

i explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. according to toronto health and bylaws that is bullshit. the situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. the bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information i have been receiving from the building management. 

the bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. i heard nothing until monday. come monday morning i get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. they will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. the cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. i'm guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

the city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. i do not believe them at all. we have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they ""didn't know"" and will be handing it over. from what i understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. i have the personal contact information for the officer i spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. we went from ""submit a maintenance request"" to ""we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately"" in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

thank you so much reddit!!! i couldn't have done it without your help!! 

here is hoping the next few months continues on a more upward trajectory. ",2
"for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him? so my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. she was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. she was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn't lift a finger to go visit her. 

i tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. he said no. and my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. i spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he'd have to fly over to her country too. which is fair enough. 

he said no, he didn't want to fly or travel anywhere. my son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

last week, he told us she's dumped him. i went on her fb page as we're all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she's upset it didn't work out but these things happen, so we're on good terms) and looks like she's with a new guy already. me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

i confessed to them both that i actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. he did not treat her properly and i hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. i said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

wife and son are very upset that i said this. very very upset and my wife says i am being horrible. 

aita? i stand by what i said.",3

"i think my (31/m) girlfriend (26/f) cheated on me and stole my money. we have been dating for around 2 years now.

friday night, one of my friends called me and told me he was watching my girlfriend kissing another guy at one of the bars in the area. it's a place her and i don't really frequent, but many of my friends go there on the weekends. since it was crowded, he didn't think she saw him. apparently a little while later, his girlfriend shows up there and sees my girlfriend hanging with this guy they don't recognize, then watching as they kiss again. she never came home saturday morning, ended up coming back around 1 in the afternoon.

there is no reason either of them would lie to me, i've been friends with the guy since 6th grade and with his girlfriend since they started dating 4 years ago. both super nice people.

i confronted my girlfriend about it last night and she freaked, calling them liars, calling me manipulative, and (after initially denying there was another guy) calling the other guy ""just a friend"". i went to work about an hour later and came home a few hours ago. all of her stuff is gone, which is fine with me because i don't believe her and i think she was cheating. worse though, she took my fire safe which contains an emergency credit card, about $700 in cash, my social security card, my passport and the title to my truck. her name isn't on my bank account thankfully but it looks like she's trying to clean me out, how would i proceed?",8
"i (21f) found a hidden camera in my house. i suspect my sil (26f) put it there to watch me while i babysit my nephew (1m). what do i do? i babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm mon-fri for free because a) i love my brother and nephew and b) i'm already a sahm for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, i have everything he needs already at home and i love kids. 

the spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. there is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv i found a weird circular object with a lens in it. after some googling i found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. i flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. he vehemently denied it and suggested i called the police and explain to them that i need a bug check. the only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my sil; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and bro and our parents only come on the weekends. i suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. another reason i suspect sil is because i had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" it could be a coincidence, but now that i found the camera i'm not so sure.


if it's her, she knows i know since i'm assuming she saw me find it. what do i do? do i confront her and ask if its hers? i couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; i have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. i would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care i take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course i treat my nephew the same.",8

"for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after i got rich? my mom left my dad when i was 17 (i'm 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. we all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. she had 2 more kids with this guy. 

when my mom and dad broke up i moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. the major reason for this was because she told me to leave as i kept fighting with her new dude. i really did not want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and i was really upset that she didn't give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. when she told me to leave...something in me changed and i am still unable to forgive her. that solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. and my sister and mom were close so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

since i was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc i like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. they gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that's much they believed in me) and basically, i majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. the profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, i'm living a life i never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

i moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we've started a new life. i am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and i'm grateful so much bc i was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

for the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. she is getting increasingly more insistent that i go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don't. she keeps telling me that 'even if i don't forgive her i should look out for the kids as they're innocent in all this' 

because day to day i have no interest in helping her or her family? imo she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. i just can't forgive her though.",3

"if i played ""another one bites the dust"" at my brother's wake? my brother died. he was an incredible, funny guy, i miss him like i lost one of my limbs. maybe it's stupid, but i want people to remember the person he was. my dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very catholic funeral service. he wasn't catholic and wouldn't like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn't know there. he'd think it's way too fancy, way too much. 

he and i had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, i guess). he told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while ""it's raining men"" played in the background...obviously not an option....also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like ""highway to hell"" and ""another one bites the dust."" 

to remember him, i want to bring a speaker and play ""another one bites the dust"" at his wake. i would explain it to the people at the wake and say that i wanted to preserve the person he was. maybe i could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. there will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren't very familiar with him and are catholic, so i've been thinking maybe not. but i really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. i think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

wibta?

edit: i didn't really expect this response, but thank you. my brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. i swear, i almost sense his hand in it. i don't know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

this morning, i talked to my dad about the wake. i suggested, as some of you did, that maybe i could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. i found a violin one that i really liked. my dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and i made. he actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. i hadn't really been thinking about my dad as much as i should have, i thought of him as opposition, i guess he cared way less about the catholic stuff than i thought. 

i also reached out to some of my brother' s friends. some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. we are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we're going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

thanks again.",3
"gay people leaving heterosexual marriages are not brave, they're assholes if you commit to spend your life with someone, you should be sexually and emotionally attracted to them (or if you're not, your significant other should know that going into the marriage). 

it is messed up to allow someone to commit their life to you under the false pretext that you're sexually attracted to that gender. just because you're not ready to come out of the closet does not mean you need to destroy someone else's life. because they'll be there, destroyed, alone, and trying to pick up the pieces, while you're out on a new journey of self discovery.",6

"just found out my boyfriend was an incel — reposted from aita (deleted from so reposting here.)

i met my boyfriend through a local dnd facebook page. we started talking every day over messenger and pretty soon we were meeting up to continue our conversations in person. we had a lot of stuff in common, and i thought he was really funny, and i just enjoyed his company. we started dating and we've been dating for nearly a year. we moved in together in may.

however, yesterday i found out from one of our dnd friends that he used to comment on r/braincels . he brought it up in a ""good for him for moving on"" way but holy fuck. i only knew about incels from the guy that killed all those people a few years back. i managed to get the friend to tell me the account name (he got really uncomfortable and asked me not to tell my boyfriend) and although he never said anything violent, my boyfriend repeatedly called girls derogatory names, said we were inferior, we were whores, we would never date a short ugly man like him, etc. his last post he mentioned that he was talking to a ""foid"" and that she was actually showing interest. i think he meant me.

he was going through a really hard time this past year, not in a good mental place, but i don't think that excuses all the sexist and gross things he said about women. he's never shown any misogyny towards me or anyone else, but how do i know he doesn't still feel that way? would i be the asshole for dumping him over something that happened pre-our relationship? should i give him a chance to explain? i love him and i don't know if i can be objective if he asks me to sympathize with him. but i also don't think i can continue to be with him knowing he things i'm not deserving of the same respect as men.

added info from last post: he's never done anything i consider a red flag, but i also have been blind to warning signs in past relationships, and he never told me about his misogynistic history. i feel like my trust has been breached. 

do i end things? give him the chance to talk? or give him a chance?",8
"why are there so many popular right-wing ""dominant debaters"" (ben shapiro, milo yiunnapalosi), but left-wing counterparts seem nowhere to be found? tl;dr: the personality of an ""always right"", dominant debater, is common amongst several right-wing public figures, but i have trouble understanding why the same personality seems so scarce within left politics.

the whole ""arguing with facts"" , being extremely confident and forward, is my best way of describing the personality of the two mentioned in the title (amongst others, that steven crowder guy from the meme). you see them debating hundreds of people and ""never being wrong""; although usually they're arguing less experienced people.

i'm not taking a political stance here, but generally these debaters have compilations on youtube on how they ""destroy a liberal"" or ""dismantle socialism in front of a communist crowd"", and the whole idea of someone speaking that is regarded as never being wrong, usually puts me off.

but i never see a similar personality type of a left-wing debater. hell i can't recall seeing a prominent left wing figure that does public speeches and debates where they ""dismantle the capitalist agenda"".

again not in any way arguing for or against right wing/left wing. i don't think right wing argues with facts and left with feelings, thats just the result of the image ben shapiro seems to commercialize",7

"tifu by loudly telling a female workmate i was going to finger her so i (m 22) work in a factory that is slightly short staffed, so from time to time some of the office staff have to come through to the factory and help out. one of these office workers is a (f 18) who we'll call jess. so jess was in the factory helping out and i happened to walk past her wearing some rubber gloves. now jess and i have a friendly bit of banter from time to time, and so as i was passing her she looked at my gloves and said 

""you look like you're about to go finger a cow""
(which is a bit of a weird thing to say, but hey ho) 

so me being the master of wit that i am instantly thought ""right, now's my time to shine! if i say the right thing i could turn this into a funny insult and call her a cow""
my brain decided malfunction and what actually came out was

""i'll finger you""

not surprisingly this immediately drew a funny look from her and i felt my face start to glow red from awkwardness...
because of the level of noise i  the factory i have sort of developed a loud voice in order to be heard. it just so happened that one of the machines cut out at almost the same moment and the factory went *relatively* quiet. everybody in the immediate vicinity heard and looked over at me...
at this point i wanted to just crawl into a hole, but i stood my ground and tried explaining myself

""i meant that as though you're a cow, not that i actually want to finger you""

this seemed to clear things up for her but now everyone at work keeps making fingering puns and innuendo's. 
i can't look jess in the eye any more. works gonna be a little awkward for a while...

tl/dr:  female workmate said i looked like i was going to go ""finger a cow"" so as my attempt a a witty response i said ""i'll finger you."" now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references

"my niece's (5) school allowed a person to visit her at lunch and bring her a drink, all without this person being on the list of people my sister (26) approved to have contact with her. located in oklahoma, usa

my sister and i have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. my niece told my sister about it when she got home. my sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. so they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. 

the principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. the only thing i can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? they risked my niece's safety and i think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but i'm not sure what could be done.

update: my sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. the board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. the school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution. thank you to the people who were helpful!",2

"by trying to tell my parents about jeff epstein's suicide. this literally just happened and i've decided to lock myself in my room until further notice.

i was surfing through my newsfeed this morning and i happened to see news articles that jeffrey epstein (rot in hell) has committed suicide. now, my family and i all talk about current events and politics. my parents were up and about getting ready for the day, so i figure i'll go tell them the news.

their door was cracked open, so there's the fuck up. i walk in and am greeted by the sight of my mother blowing my dad. as i hear my mom say ""do ya mind??"", i immediately walk the other way, and back downstairs to my room. all the while trying to burn away what i just saw.

they leave for the weekend at noon, and i have no plans on seeing them again this morning.

"bank gave away my entire banking account so last week, a check i wrote bounced from an account i have that i rarely use. it's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. i called the bank where i was informed that i closed the account to pay for ""my wedding"". i told them i sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. after them jerking me around ""are you sure you're not getting married"" ""did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding""...etc. i finally got them to open a fraud case. 

here's the crazy part. i call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. i finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. this woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. she lives in florida and i live in colorado. we do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. so she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. i figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. open and shut case.

so now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. they asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but i have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. the icing on the cake was i got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

do i have any legal recourse? do i just shut up and hope she doesnt steal my identity and be glad they're giving my money back? what advice do you have?",2

"update my father got my 14 year old sister pregnant. a lot has happened since i posted.

i talked with my sister for a long time over the next week and she eventually agreed to talking to an adult at school. i went with her to talk to a teacher she was close with. after a lot of crying together she called the police and our school counselor and principal. they basically didn't let us go home that day from school. 

we ended up getting a case worker and parents of my sister's best friend (not the mom who was constantly harassing us about going public) took us in temporarily. we are currently still with them. 

the police visited my dad who won't admit to raping me or my sister, but they found a ton of child porn on his computer and other things they wouldn't tell us about. he has been arrested for the child porn. unfortunately, that did make the news and everyone knows. it's extremely embarrassing and stressful to have people judge you all the time. people wouldn't shut up about it for like two weeks. 

my sister moved to a different school that helps with troubled kids and special situations for while she is pregnant. we are hoping she can go back after she has the baby and continue at her first school... ideally.. 

she and i both have gone through a lot of counseling and she is okay giving up the child for adoption now. our case worker and counselor are both really great about this whole thing.  mom is still not in the picture.

i fully plan on changing my name to my mom's maiden name and so does my sister. my case worker says that's completely possible for us to do. thanks for that advice reddit, i got that from here. 

anyway, thanks for the advice. it helped me talk her into how serious it was.

"for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 ford bronco i owned as a teenager? so how to begin with this...i realize that on paper i am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations i'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even i did the right thing. 

when i was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 ford bronco. it was my true passion and i don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. plus my dad and i would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when i was teenager it was always that bronco that brought us back together. i made a huge mistake and sold the truck when i turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, i've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

we had a baby in early february. she is our first and the light of my life. my wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. i guess i need to say this. 

two weeks ago i was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. i stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. my dad and i had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so i just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't my bronco! 

i asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on i-25 as we spoke from colorado to buy it for $21000. i freaked out and asked him if i could buy it right then and there for $23000. he said if i could come up with the cash, yes. i had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so i had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, i maxed out my credit card to venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and i fucking drove away in my old car. it was like a dream come true. like a literal dream come true. it needs a lot of work i can't afford right now but it's mine. like in my driveway mine. again. i can't even describe what a joy this is. 

my wife and her parents are furious with me. they feel i was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. my point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. but this bronco means everything to me and if i wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. to me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

like i said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. how do you guys see it?

edit: had no idea this would go so one way. i guess i messed up. i talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. the $4k will be a gift and she's going to give me whatever i need to restore it. she's always been awesome to me and she's rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. sorry to get everyone so mad at me, i was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit in the morning: i couldn't figure out why i was getting so many private's  but i guess this must be locked now. i didn't tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and said i found a buyer for the bronco. i'll figure out how to cross that bridge when i get there but my wife was so relieved that i ""had come to your senses"" i don't want to disappoint her. it's going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",3

"32m my wife 33f will not shut up, and i'm not sure i can take it that much longer. is it possible for that to be a reason to leave? i'm not sure if i should have posted this on instead.  but here goes: my wife will not shut up.  i'm not talking about your usual chatty cathy.  i mean she (almost) literally will not. shut. up.  she will talk continuously from the moment she knows i am within earshot.  not just in the same room.  i mean as soon as it's reasonable to assume that i can hear her.  she will not *stop* talking until i'm gone, and sometimes not even then.  on more than one occasion, i've gone into the bathroom, turned on the loud exhaust fan, taken a leisurely dump, and then returned to hear her cheerfully engaged in the same ""conversation"" she was enjoying before i went in.  she also refuses to *use* the exhaust fan while she's in the restroom because it would prevent her from being heard.  so i get to hear all the bathroom noises on top of whatever homeric epic about her friend's cousin's girlfriend's hairdresser she's blathering on about.  
  
i once drove from tampa, fl to chicago, il with her (before we were married- i'm such an idiot!) without saying more than ten sentences.  she did not stop talking the entire way.  the entire way.  
  
television on to a show i like?  pfft.  that's not a problem.  she'll happily turn the volume down so it doesn't get in the way.  having sex?  that's the perfect time to tell me about how olivia newton john still has the leather pants she wore in grease and she- brace yourself- still fits in them!  really!  needless to say, we don't go to the movies.  ever.  i've been shushed out of too many theaters.   
  
i get it.  she grew up in a huge italian catholic family in the bronx.  if you don't talk loud and constantly, you don't get to talk at all.  i, on the other hand, grew up in a scandinavian family with two children.  to this day, i'm not sure we ever *had* a conversation in our house.  i actually often wonder if that's what made me attractive to her.  i was taught to politely listen to people and then wait for them to finish before replying.  she never finishes (or takes a breath it sometimes seems), so to her i'm paying rapt attention to her no matter how much she talks.  
  
that's not true, though.  another difference between people of swedish heritage is that we don't use ""filler"" words for acknowledgement.  other than the minnesotan ""naaaaah,"" (useful on every occasion!) we're pretty much silent when we listen to others.  no ""uh huh"" or ""yeah"" or ""omg!"" needed.  a nod of the head every ten minutes or so is all you need to convey your attentiveness.  i think it has a lot to with living in the frigid north.  you keep your mouth open as much as my wife does, and your teeth are going to shatter from the cold.    
  
to her, that's like being in the room with a dead person.  she's always stopping to ask ""are you even listening?"" or say ""you never pay attention to me!"" or even quiz me with ""what did i just say?""  i've become an expert at storing the last two to four words she says and parroting them back at her.  she'll be like ""blah blah blah ... and then she told him she wasn't taking that kind of crap anymore,"" and i'll go ""that kind of crap?"" as if i had any idea what kind of crap it was or who it was that wouldn't take it anymore.  and she'll say ""yeah!"" and think i've been paying attention the whole time.  
  
i joke about it a lot, but it's actually getting to the point where it's a problem.  our son is seven years old, and he has developed a pronounced stutter because she interrupts him constantly.  growing up in her house, if anyone paused even for a millisecond, that was grounds for talking over them.  and you talked loud so they didn't finish.  my son apparently inherited some of my less ""staccato"" speech patterns, and she basically just uses that to interrupt and take over the conversation.  it got so bad that he started automatically stopping and restarting words, even when not being interrupted.  i didn't know that was considered a stutter until we went to one of those parent/teacher night things, and a teacher listened to wife and then turned to me and said ""well at least now i know why josh has a stutter.""  just like that.  
  
she's failed at least one job interview because of this.  i know because i lined it up with a business acquaintance myself.  he called me up and said sorry, but he just couldn't take being in the same room with her because she wouldn't stop talking.  
  
we rarely are invited for a second ""couples date.""  she monopolizes the conversation every time we go out with other people.  who wants more than one does of that?  
  
you're probably wondering: ""well, have you *told* her about this?""  yes.  many times.  sometimes jokingly.  sometimes with utter seriousness.  the reactions vary from anger (talks louder, higher, faster, and uses lots more swear words) to tears (she's the only person i know who can carry on a totally unrelated conversation while sobbing hysterically).  the one thing that doesn't happen is her talking any less.  
  
i try not to let it get to me.  she's a very affectionate woman.  loves me to death.  mother of my child.  pretty as the day we met- prettier, even.  we still get plenty of ""alone time,"" (granted, she won't shut up while we're doing it, but i'm pretty busy so i don't really notice as much).  but it *does* get to me.  it's selfish and shows a lack of self awareness.  there's a time and a place for enthusiastic conversation, and they're not ""always"" and ""everywhere.""  
  
i know the answer to the problem: i have to ""talk back.""  in effect, the only thing that possibly *could* shut her up is for me to do the same thing as she does.  i would have to interrupt at the slightest pause.  i would have to talk louder- yelling if necessary- when she tries to interrupt me.  i would have to learn to use italian hand gestures to emphasize my points and chop off her objections.  but i'm not italian.  i'm a waspy pale dude who grew up in a household that would have made a mortuary sound like a middle school cafeteria.  
  
twelve years of this has finally pushed me to the brink.  i'm not sure i can take it that much longer.  i'm just not sure if i could get a word in to tell the judge why i'm there in his divorce court.  my wife wouldn't let me.  
  
tl;dr: wife will not shut up.  is that reasonable grounds for leaving her?  
  
edit: obligatory reddit ""omg i had no idea this would blow up.""  which is true.  i thought maybe a couple of people would just call me an asshole and that would be it.  but rip, inbox.  it was nice to know ya.  so in the interest of not replying to *every* comment, i will try to address some of the common ones and answer some of the questions i saw popping up multiple times.

a2 - yes, she is hot.  and funny.  and vivacious.  also, i really *was* a ""nordic silent bear"" (thanks, /u/sarah_dragonfire), my wife drew me out of my shell.  and if i'm brutally honest with myself: when you're young and getting laid on the regular, a lot of things don't seem all that terrible.  damn you, penis!  this is all your fault!  
  
q3 - did your kid really develop a stutter because of this?  
a3 - medically speaking, i cannot state this with 100% certainty.  the cause was never formally diagnosed.  however, i watched it happen first hand.  i'm not a qualified speech therapist, but i think it was a reasonable conclusion to draw based on the observations i made.  i'd welcome a dissenting opinion from an actual professional though, if only to salve my conscience.  which leads to:  
  
q4 - aren't *you* really the one responsible for your kid's stutter?  after all, you did nothing to stop it.  
a4 - guilty.  and i feel utterly like shit about it all the time.  for the record, i did bring it up lots of times even to the point of getting into arguments about it and speaking harshly to my wife when she interrupted my son.  but i think by the time i realized it was happening most of the damage was done.  and anything i could do was more expressing my anger about it than actually making an effective change.  all the rest of this weirdly long post is just ranting.  if there's an actual justification for leaving, this is it (and i'm deathly afraid that she'll get full custody and just make it worse or even irreparable).    
  
q5 - is it because she's (pick one: ocd, insecure, autistic, mentally ill, ...)?  
a5 - i don't think so, although i've always sensed an overwhelming need for attention.  i see it in her family dynamic, in that all of her many siblings were in constant competition for their parents' attention and affection.  
  
q6 - have you tried counseling?  
a6 - no.  probably should have, but i know her well enough that even mentioning it would shatter her.  it's bizarre that i can't bring myself to do a lot of things people have suggested (and believe me, i've probably thought of all of them) because they just seem too cruel to me.  and yet, i'm seriously considering divorce.  i realize the contradiction there.

"update: old coworkers are telling me my old boss talks to them about ""all the issues i'm having."" found out my therapist is my old boss's husband. (mn) original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/anlpqr/old_coworkers_are_telling_me_my_old_boss_talks_to/)

&#x200b;

**old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that i was having a ton of issues. i found out my therapist is her husband, but i didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200b;

**new developments summary**: there's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. i even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200b;

**new developments, continued**: therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). i have a very peculiar family dynamic, so i think he talked about that. however, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that i was depressed and had family issues. neat. one of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200b;

**resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than i thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. i don't know if he'll practice again.

&#x200b;

***thank you all -*** you were a huge help, and a confidence boost that me complaining about this would actually get it somewhere and not just create more stress in my life. it's apparently led to a ton of drama at my old workplace, which has been sort of pleasant to hear updates about from afar. glad to not be there anymore. i also found a new therapist who's great, and she's really helped validate that the old guy (and his wife) was one bag egg in a sea of otherwise well-meaning people.",2
"boston, my therapist has created a false rape and forced abortion and is reporting it on my behalf, i was not raped. i am in boston but my abortion happened in new york city. i was 18 and this was completely legal. 

i'm 18 and in college. like all 18 year olds, i mess up. i messed up big time and i ended up pregnant. i waited a week after my pregnancy test came up positive, i went to the doctor to 100% confirm the pregnancy, and my best friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, and i took a couples' trip to nyc so i could have the abortion in a safe environment and have everything taken care of in a timely manner. 

we got back to boston and life went on. i am in therapy to work through my problems regarding the suicide attempts of my older sister and dealing with the repercussions of her mental illness. i have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, i'm not considered depressed, i have no history of any kind of any mental illnesses, self harm, or anything of the sort. i receive my therapy in a non religious environment. this is just straight up confidential counseling because my sister attempted suicide right before i went to college, my parents are toxic, and i needed help with that burden. 

i told my therapist immediately that i'd had an abortion, told her my reasons (cost of a baby, not wanting children, i go to a university that i worked my ass off to get into and i'll be damned if i let an unwanted pregnancy ruin my life. i also could not raise a child that i disdained. selfish? yes. but i'm not sorry). i also informed her that my boyfriend and i are still together and that he and i plan on staying together, the sex was between two adults who 100% consented, it was just a mixup and confusion on both of our parts. he and i split the cost of the abortion with him paying 75% of the cost. 

i go home and do homework. at around 4 pm, i get a visit from the boston police who are investigating a rape. they think that i'm the victim and my boyfriend is the perpetrator and that i've been forced to have an abortion, i ask them where they got this false information and give them proof that both he and i agreed that abortion was the way to go. after a lot of talking to smooth things over and apologizing, they left. 

then i get a call from my parents. they're ranting on and on about how i've gotten an abortion and sinned in god's eyes, how i've been fornicating and screwed every man in nyc, and how my lack of contact (i'm nc with them because of abuse and they're narcissists) is killing my mother. they screamed down the phone for four hours before telling me that they've been given my address in boston by my therapist and are coming to get me no matter what. 

it becomes clear. my therapist called the police, reported a false rape and forced abortion, violated all sorts of confidentiality, and had to track my parents down (i never gave her their number, address, or personal information. she did not know their names, i only ever called them mom and dad) to call them to say that i'd been raped and gotten an abortion. 

i never gave her any sort of go ahead to do anything. i never used the word rape in our sessions, in fact, when i mentioned the sex, i called it ""consensual sex"". the police are still hounding me, i'm freaking out and constantly having panic attacks, my therapist is making things worse by continuing to knowingly provide false information to the police (although i gave them the information that should have ended this all), therapist is also saying that i have stockholm syndrome and that's why i won't report my boyfriend, and i'm at a loss for what to do. 

i also know why she's having some weird witch hunt. my boyfriend is in a fraternity and in her mind, i was brutally raped at a fraternity party (this is what she told the police). i was not and in the session i said specifically told her that i never had sex with him at his fraternity house several times when she tried to convince me that i was raped at his fraternity house. 

i've also started to get calls from the nypd investigating the ""forced abortion"" and i'm freaking out and don't know what to do. this is serious. 

at this point in time i know that i need to get the police off my butt. is there a way that would help me? is a lawyer the best way to go? also, is there a way for me to report my therapist and make sure that she is punished? is there a way to make sure she doesn't do this again? 


edit: when the cops came the first time, i told them that she was completely falsifying everything and i gave them evidence. she is continuing to call and labeling me with various mental illnesses so she gets her point across and so i'm not taken seriously. the last time the cops called was last night.

"suing a firearm company because their firearm was used in a shooting is the stupidest thing ever . suing a company because their firearm was used in a shooting makes 0 sense. 

if someone gets murdered with a hammer are you going to sue the hammer company because their hammer was used to kill somebody ?  (hammer murders are actually common apparently) 

if someone drinks and drives and kills someone are you going to sue the alcohol company ? or the maker of the car ?  

you can't help what some crazy person does. and everyone else shouldn't be punished for someone else's wrong doing. 

if i sell someone a pen and then they turn around and stab someone to death with that pen , am i at fault ?

"by teaching my baby sign language i go to this ""mommy and me"" thing every week with my daughter. not because it's my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as ""a christmas gift"" to my one-year-old (aka she doesn't think i am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).

anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. but all these kids know sign language, and i thought that was pretty damn cool. so i start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it's working! suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say ""more"" and ""all done"" and ""drink""! she can call me mom and my husband, dad! holy shit! thanks pinterest moms! i take back all the shit i talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

well today with my husband out of town, i didn't feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants i decided to go out for a quick dinner. the kid loves french fries and so do i. so we hit the local burger joint and i order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. the server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and i set it out of her reach so she doesn't hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. so of course every time she wants some, she signs ""drink"". and every time she wants my attention, she signs ""dad"" because apparently the slightly different sign for ""mom"" isn't as fun for her. ok, whatever. 

well i notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they're looking over at us and snickering. i'm like okay, i did like 4 quick google searches, maybe i botched some of what i taught her. it's fine. but then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iphone down with a message typed out for me to read. it says something to the effect of ""she's calling you 'dumb' and telling you she wants to drink alcohol"". 

i'm like... wait... what? so she continues to show me that i have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for ""drink (non-alcoholic beverage)"" and ""drink alcohol"" and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since i am her mom. i can only imagine what the pinterest moms would've done had i shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

tl;dr asl is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

eta: thanks, everyone! i'm glad you all enjoyed this post. please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that i was trying to teach my child proper asl. they were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as asl. they just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

also please note that i literally searched ""baby sign language"" and based the signs off of still frames from google. i have no idea how close they were to the real signs. additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. she speaks english well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. we were always sure to say the words while signing them. she now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that i decided to share with you all. i'm new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen ""today"". you can take back your upvotes for this as necessary :)",4

"update(az) our neighbor's dog was apparently poisoned and because we had complained about the dog barking, police wanted to go through our ""internet history."" original here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a75f0o/az_our_neighbors_dog_was_poisoned_police_want_to/

>edit: hey guys i'm involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in dm but it would sure be easier if i could just answer them once. i'm sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, i really don't want to say where i am and my attorneys name. all the laws i found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

so thank you to everyone who responded. and i guess thank you to everyone in the dms who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, i want to sleep in my own house. just to allay the fears of the other nice dm's, i did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

i took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on monday night. i also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. i called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

he was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the da actually pursuing this were slim to none. he did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, i could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. he said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


so basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as i type this) but i just heard (wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. in fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. the people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. they also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all i know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people i've ever encountered). the can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). so with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

so our complaint to animal control from last thursday is still on the books. the lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. the criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

"for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson? new to reddit, please bare with. 

so i (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

however, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. she and i have quite a lot in common, and i actually like spending time with her. however it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; i'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. however, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if i want coffee. i sleep naked. every time prior to the last one, i've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. i always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but i didn't"". 

when she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, i intentionally slept on top of the covers. sure enough, she barges in at 7am, begins to ask if i want coffee and sees my you-know-what. she immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. my mate later pulled me aside and said i was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that i'd ""threatened"" to do it before (i literally just said ""okay but what if i had no covers and you saw everything"" before). they're now framing this to others that i'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how i get my rocks off, and i'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. for doing this?",3

in the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. it was all a blur but i kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what i think. well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided not to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). we met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but i was prepared and considered that was it.

the box stayed in my fridge for i dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? she went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and i also met somebody else. one day i was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously i still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then i saw a full page note from her. she basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.

i just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. i probably looked like an asshole for how i acted when i last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am i..

"for ditching my date and causing a scene? i'm 19f and my date was 25m, i was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while i was half way through my session. 

i get an ig message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would've found me since my page is super private, my username isn't specific at all to my real name and i have 40 followers. 
he explains he's so and so's friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it's hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so i'm excited and we plan to meet up. 

we catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, i take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. i smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. we're in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.

i study justice so he's telling me how he's an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that's when i freak. he makes a comment about how high i am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point i start to get really scared.
he keeps asking if anyone knows i'm with him, who i live with, how much money i make & how much i have on me etc. just weird questions. i was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction imo was much more extreme. i was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. my perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say i was genuinely scared.

i hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so i could be around people and also so he wasn't dui, he didn't want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that i felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.

i get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he's taking a phone call. i go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene ""i'm really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me"" they catch on and can see i'm upset. i sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he'll take me home but they are very firm. he addresses me quite angrily and asks ""who does your mum think your with?"" the owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. 

i felt guilty since i had gotten along with him and he'd taken the time to see me, i'm not 100% sure if i was in danger and if i could've stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. i tried to have tact in the situation and didn't have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would've been better to tell him i was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

edit: some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, i'm super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? correct me if i'm wrong please. i genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there's something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way i did and if i'm the ahole for handling a bad date this way. i see that this isn't as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here irl i had very mixed and negative reactions. hence why i got on here and despite all that, i do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying i did the right thing even though it didn't necessarily feel like that in the moment.",3

"boyfriend (21m) kisses me when i'm asleep lol should i tell him i know? so i've been with my boyfriend for 2 years and i found this out pretty early on. he does cute stuff when he thinks i'm asleep. i'm a deep sleeper so i never woke up from it. i couldn't asleep one night and i knew he was walking past me and he blew me a kiss and just said ""love ya bitch"" while he was walking lol. i didn't know what to say because we hadn't said i love you or anything at that point so i just continued to pretend to be asleep. he actually does it all the time!! sometimes he'll give me a kiss on my cheek or arm, or he'll say ""love you babe"". he is so sweet when i'm asleep!! he's not really affectionate like that when i'm awake, he kisses me but he doesn't randomly call me cute or something. and when i'm asleep, he can say ""did you know you're so cute"" like what!!!!???? sometimes i pretend to be asleep because i like hearing it. and he'll tell his friends that he's not a pussy and he's so tough and everything and i'm like 🙄🙄 you literally come to me when i'm sleeping and tell me good night in this sweet voice. i never say anything though 

when he's sitting down doing something random, i just have the strongest urge to go up to him and give him a kiss and be like ""you're cute babe"" and maybe he'll realize that i know. or should i just continue pretending i have no idea???",8
"(unpopular for cannabis users) i think weed culture is awful. i use cannabis everyday, i would be considered a ""stoner"" by most people. weed culture is childish, cringy and counterproductive to the destigmatization of this wonderful drug. i would rather kick myself in the balls than own anything with a cannabis leaf drawn on it, wether it's shirt, a hat, an ashtray, a rolling tray, a poster a tattoo, a bong or a fucking sticker. people whose apparent jobs are to smoke weed on youtube make me sick and if you look at recipes for edibles they will invade your reccomended videos.

 i went to a legal shop here in montreal and left slmost immediately due to the overwhelming douche baggery happening in there. they turned bob marley, a man who sang songs of love and unity, and turned him into a mass marketed caricature who seemed to have only cared about weed. every mention of 420 makes me roll my eyes, if anything, canadians should celebrate 10/17 (the day cannabis was legalized federally). and dealers in general are insufferable weed snobs.

 every dealer i have had until my current suppliers have been arrogant douchebags who try and tell you you are ""smoking wrong"" and think they are your friends. i know it's shitty to bag on how people enjoy things but weed culture makes all cannabis users looks immature, lazy and stupid.

"update had a falling out with the girl i love and got served a cease and desist order. what can i legally do? michigan (x-post on r/relationships) past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

oh boy. i've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. i wasn't going to, but i know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and i actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and i read all the comments there. it was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. i decided i needed to post again for some closure. i would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

for those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so i'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. i want to take full accountability for everything, so i want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

first, i want to assure everyone that i didn't contact that girl ever again. since i moved, i no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (i don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. i have avoided getting any information about her at all). the way i acted and the way i hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but i know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. if she wants to get closure by talking to me, i'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. i don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. i learned in my classes that men do that a lot. i don't want to hurt her anymore, so i will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

i was distraught after my last post here. i admit i came here looking for validation, not help. i had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that i was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that i needed help. all of these people were right. i don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive i was in response to the comments). i checked myself into therapy in michigan the week after i posted here. i knew something was wrong, but i was still in denial. i thought i needed help with heartbreak. i didn't recognize that i actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that i used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. after a few sessions, i started seeing a psychiatrist too. i got on mood stabilizers and i started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way i was acting. something that couldn't be cured by medication. after talking it over with my therapist, i decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my aunt's house. within a month of me posting here, i had moved into her house. 

after moving, i started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. i had a fresh idea of the issues i wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that i was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in michigan (though i wasn't stalking anyone at this point, i was just obsessing in my mind. which is still bad, but i wasn't actively victimizing anyone). i realize that in addition to therapy, i needed more help. my therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so i signed up voluntarily. i attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. the goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  i know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? people like me. people like me in the last post. i look like a normal person. i grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. monsters come in all shapes and sizes and i fooled myself by saying because i didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because i wasn't ""like"" the abusers i saw on tv, that i wasn't one. but i am. i can't take back what i've done, but i can promise myself i will never victimize anyone else again. 

in conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. i want to say that i do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. i made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because i thought i had the right to dictate how others interact with me. the class is a year-long class and i have only been in it for a month, but i have already learned so much. i have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. but i believe that since i've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. i've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so i made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people i am stalking or believe i am in love with (i talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and i'm sorry for how i decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice i asked for.

**tl;dr**: i ceased, i desisted, and i got mental health help. thanks to everyone.

**edit**: wow, just wow. i didn't expect this response. i guess this is a top post of all time. 
i wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. i read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though i didn't reply to many. i cried a lot while reading them. 

2. i didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. i'm not sure why i did it, but i don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. i don't know if i deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. but thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. i've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program i am in. the program i am in is specific to my area, so i'd rather not disclose the name. however, i encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" i did some research today about the class i am in and that is what these types of classes are called. they all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. there is no official federal program i don't think.

4. i am not healed. i have a lot of obsessive thoughts and i have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. my meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process i need to change and that cant be done with pills. i have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. i have never had real ""friends"" until the ones i have now. before jaime, i definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women i had crushes on and men i wanted to be friends with. it was never as bad as it was with jaime, but i still am sure i made people uncomfortable.  i also have some self-harm behaviors i am working out. so to the person who was worried that i would use all of the good praise to say ""oh i'm perfect now so i can do what i want,"" trust me, i know i am fucked up and i want to change. i want to have normal relationships and friendships. i want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

please get help if you need it. take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",2
"serious just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. a few days ago i was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

i decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until i decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

here's the joke i told:

""what do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

throw your washing (laundry if you're american) in.""

one of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. when i asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

obviously i felt mortified as i didn't know about it, and said ""i'm so sorry to hear that. did he drown?""

""no,"" replied the guy. ""he choked on a sock.""",0

"update - if i still give my stepson the birthday gift i bought for him despite his mother asking me to hold it off for a month because she knows my gift will upstage hers and she wants to see him enjoy her gift first? hi reddit, just dropping by to give you an update to my post. 

 https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cyadgx/wibta\_if\_i\_still\_give\_my\_stepson\_the\_birthday/(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cyadgx/wibta_if_i_still_give_my_stepson_the_birthday/) 

jack celebrated his birthday in september, and as many of you suggested, i told him that i'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. that way it didn't look like kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy kim's gift. 

kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that i was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. it's flattering to read that so many of you think that joe and i are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with kim. it was humbling for kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

for those who are asking, i didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because i wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone i know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. but since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, i bought jack a horse. my family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem. 

jack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!

thank you all for your comments and i wish everyone the best.",3

"by ingesting my bf's chemo figured it out today, but have been fucking up for 3 weeks. 

bf started chemo and has been very fortunate to be feeling pretty ok. so our sex life has stayed at our normal level. probably even more active since, well, he's terminal. 

i've been having horrible nausea and headaches. i already have anxiety so i figured i'm just a mess over the cancer, kids, job stress, etc. and making myself sick. 

this morning i woke up queasy again and joked about having sympathy chemo symptoms. i google, and no that's not a thing, but secondhand chemo exposure is...through bodily fluids. symptoms include nausea and headaches. and the periods of me feeling bad line up perfectly to his treatments. 

i've been letting my dude nut poison in me folks. 

you're supposed to use condoms for several days after chemo and also not swap a bunch of spit. now that i know this it seems super obvious. but uh, guess i was too horny to think it through.

tl;dr did dirty deeds with my bf's chemo dick and got sick from it

eta: thanks for all the well wishes and debates on my stupidity. 

to answer as many questions as i can and also because i feel mildly defensive: he is stage 4, with literal dozens of bone mets. there is no cure but no timeline either. we probably have a few more years. he is in excellent care at a renowned university program. we adore his team. i've been at every appointment, taken notes, blah blah. this was not reviewed with us, only side effects. the separate bathroom/ wear gloves thing was reviewed with the couple next to us and we even wondered aloud what kind of scary chemo they were getting. we didnt read the pamphlet because this ain't his first chemo rodeo. but it is mine. so all of us, including his care team, let it slip through the cracks. we're only in our 30s but our best guess is they figured he'd be too weak for sex. or they just forgot. or they figured we'd read the info. shit happens.

"for telling my friend's husband about her secret food stash? background: i have this friend mandy who i guess what you'd call ""militantly obese."" she has claimed in the past that it's a civil rights issue and that she is ""genetically fat"" just like people are ""genetically black"" (her words, not mind but you can see her mindset). 

recently mandy's husband said enough is enough is enough and told her that if she didn't at least make and effort to change he was leaving. mandy was diagnosed with being pre-diabetic and called me sobbing both because of what her husband said and the doctor being ""anofher link in the chain."" 

this was about january and mandy and her husband have been on a calorie restricted diet and he has lost...probably 20lbs and mandy has actually gained weight. mandy was using this as ""proof"" that her issue was genetic. 

i was helping mandy unload groceries the other day and came across a huge tupperware bin the back of her suv. i assumed she wanted it unloaded but as i moved it, the lid came loose and it was packed to the gills with treats, most opened and half eaten. i asked her about it. she got super defensive and told me to mind my own business. i asked her if this why she's gaining weight. she told me to fuck off. i texted her husband because in the heat of the moment i was furious she had spoken to me like that.

her husband has filed for emergency seperatrion so mandy can't ruin him financially (she has threatened this in the past) with the aim of divorce. mandy is blaming me, am i the asshole here?


edit: i accept my judgment and i won't delete but the comments have taken a ridiculous turn and i don't want to he part of this anymore. no i don't want to have sex with him. nor did i ever imply or infer that. enjoy your day.


edit 2: based on some responses that said i was the asshole for acting out of anger rather than concern (which i accept) i called and told mandy that i was sorry for my reasons for texting her husband. she said that i am just another person oppressing her and that even the avengers were oppressing her these days. i asked her what she meant (won't spoil the movie) but i explained to her that i was acting out of frustration and avengers is just a movie and now i was really concerned. she said i could take my concern and shove it up my ass and we're done and hung up and has apparently blocked my number. thank you for participating but i think it's a dead subject at this point. i hope she gets the help she needs",3
