Swimming in jeans is one of the best feelings ever.,"When you swim in denim jeans it's like you're an armored aquatic creature. The way they feel on your legs especially when you get out of the water is amazing. Feeling them slowly dry on you under the hot sun is like a wearable sauna. 

Depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. I personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. They (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they're soaking wet. 

Also, when your jeans are soaked, they're heavier. It's always leg day when your jeans are wet. 

If you haven't tried swimming in baggy jeans I suggest doing so. It will change your life.

One of the most satisfying things is upvoting a downvote.,"I'm not sure why, but it gives me so much pleasure to upvote a comment that has 0 back to 1. Sometimes I don't even read the comment before I do it.

When the post is alive and someone downvotes, I get enjoyment from thinking how angry they get when I upvote. They were emotional enough to downvote the comment, so I know how emotional they get seeing it jump back up and ultimately cancel out their vote.

I imagine someone arguing in the comment section and refreshing the page to see the person they hate on a small post has gone back to one and there is nothing they can do, their vote has already been cast.

Sometimes when 2 people are arguing, and both have 0s (from downvoting each other), I will choose one to upvote just to make another mad and feel like they are losing the argument. I don't usually choose based on who is right, but who is more emotionally invested in the conversation.

"Every year my wife has spent upwards of $1500 on new Xmas decorations she just throws away after New Years. She promised me last year was the last but I just found a huge bag of decorations in the garage. I'm disgusted. What do I do here? (Both 34, two kids)","Wife and I have been married 10 years, we have two kids 5 and 3. Wife is a good person but has no concept of money, budgeting and spending. I've gotten her following a pretty decent budget but she comes and blows her was during Xmas. 

I don't mind her being generous to friends and family. It brings her joy and I appreciate that. But what disgusts me is her ""need"" to spend money to decorate. Every single year she goes completely overboard and essentially buys an entire brand new set of Christmas decorations. Everything from tree holders to candle stands to ornaments. Every year it's all brand new and every year she's so exhausted by the end of the holiday to store and organize it all that she just throws it all away.

To best exemplify how it works let's talk about stockings. She will go to target, see cute stockings buy four of them. Then she'll go to world market and see even cuter stockings and she'll buy four of them there. Then she'll see one at Walmart which features lighting McQueen for my son and buy it and buy one for my daughter to be fair. So we'll have 10 new stockings for Xmas and all of them will be thrown in the garbage on January 2nd. The rub is my grandma hand made stockings for the entire family, so we don't even need any, let alone 10. Replace stockings with any other Xmas item and that's how it goes until we have $1500 at least in credit card bills for stuff that's just going in the garbage.

Last year we couldn't afford it all so we ended up paying interest until about April on her xmas purchases. I told her enough was enough and frankly I'm also sick of the amount of junk that were just sending to the land fill. We went over all the decorations we already have and how we could just use those. She agreed.

However I was getting ready for work (I work extra Saturday shifts in Novmeber and December to afford the holidays, another post I guess) and found two huge bags of all brand new Xmas decorations hidden in the garage. I would guess it's $300-$500 worth of stuff. I'm so disgusted I can hardly see straight. 

I'm up at 4:30 on a Saturday to work my ass off for stuff that were going to pay interest on that is going to give us 20 minutes of joy that will rot in the landfill. I feel exhausted and just want to get into bed and tell her to go work. 

What do I do here? Sitting in my truck really fighting the urge to go grab the kids and move into my moms house until we get to some resolution here.

Let's see... HER problem is that she overspends, exhausts herself, runs out of spoons, and tosses the decor rather than go through the huge and delicate storage game. HEY! YOU live there too. YOU get to enjoy her cooking, her decorating, her throwing parties for YOUR friends and YOUR family, she does the family gift shopping, sends out the cards, plans the parties, cleans up after the parties... and you? You bitch because at the end of all this emotional and physical and executive work, she's too fucking tired to carry in and organize all the deco boxes, carefully wrap each ornament, nestle it into another tissue cradle she makes, carry out the full boxes and find somewhere to put them where your untended crap overflows the shelves and leaves her with the job of reorganizing the entire place to jenga everything together. But you'll sit on your butt and bitch without lifting a hand. Hey, I've got an idea, Mr. Man. GET ON YOUR TINY SNOWFLAKE FEET AND PUT THE FUCKING DECORATIONS AWAY. Then there they are, next year.

"LPT: When overloaded at work, ask your boss to help you prioritize your tasks, even if you already know what the priorities are.","In this case, ""overloaded"" is synonymous with ""deadlines will be missed"".  ""Overloaded"" does not mean ""I'm extra stressed this week"". So with that being said...

Telling your boss you are overloaded can bring with it negative connotations such as: you are bad at prioritizing, bad at time management, or just slow.  In other words, their first reaction is likely to be that you're just complaining and not stating a fact. 

A more tactful way is to do as I said above.  Create a list of all your major tasks and prioritize them. Then go to your manager and ask them to verify the priorities as you have outlined without saying that you are overloaded.

This lets them see on paper that you have a lot on your plate. This also lets them know you are thinking ahead and that you are practicing prioritization skills. This also lets them take some responsibility for when you miss a deadline on a task because you BOTH agreed it was a lower priority. In doing this, you avoid the questions and criticism for missing a deadline. Plus, your manager now serves as a first line defense. They will be ready to defend you because they know why you missed a deadline and they were part of the process that led to that happening.

I speak from experience. A year ago this burned me. I missed a deadline because I never conveyed how taking on a new higher priority task forced me to postpone work on another major project. When the deadline came, hell rained down on me because I did not convey to my superiors that I had to keep pushing my project out to work on higher priority items. They were blindsided when I missed my deadline and I was blindsided by how disappointed they were with me.

The real LPT here is: as your priorities change, make sure your boss knows how that impacts your other tasks and the deadlines associated with them. 

Update: I didn't expect this to resonate like it did! I'm glad it's a useful LPT to so many. To clarify, I'm most certainly not advocating you abuse this. As with anything, this is a useful tool when used smartly. And obviously this is under the assumption your manager is at least decent at what they do and care about their subordinates.",LifeProTips

TIFU by getting a school locked down because I was trying to protect it.,"I work in IT at a graduate school at a large, semi-prestigious university.  

After attending to a call, I came back up the stairwell and as I opened the door I saw a yellow jacket (wasp) on the door frame next to the handle.

Keeping the door open (because I didn't want the little asshole to get spooked and fly off), I took my shoe off and THWAPED him pretty hard (perhaps a little harder than intended).  He fell, and I said to myself, ""Good job, me, you saved the school"".

Almost immediately after that, there's a school lockdown.  I'm told to get in my office, lock the doors and shut the lights off.  There's some important government people who work here, so I figure maybe they do this as a drill every so often so whatever.  But I'm still kind of nervous. 

I texted someone up at the front desk ""wtf"" and they texted back ""there was a gunshot"". 

I guess that staircase is pretty echo-y, because the next thing I know I'm trying not to laugh as police officer is questioning me, getting my information, and taking pictures of my kill like hes the fuckin wasp FBI.  At some point I heard mention of a SWAT team on standby.  It didn't even die, it was still wiggling around as he was photographing the crime scene.

This is beginning from the end of my last update on the original post, which detailed how I went to the police, found the company that did the job, and called the city to find there was no permit issued/documentation related to my address. Below is the official update!


I have called a lawyer! After some in-depth searching and a few calls, I have connected with a relatively local lawyer (I'm a bit rural) and we talked for about an hour. He wanted ALL the details I had, especially when I mentioned the arborist; he asked for the number and told me was going to ask for additional information from the inspection that would be important for a lawsuit. He also gave me the number of a surveyor, and told me I should call them asap. He then set me up with an appointment at his offices next week after the arborist's visit. As far as the criminal charges, he told me that was my call, but we could talk more about it next week. He did comment that making a police report was a smart move, so thank you reddit for that advice!! Lastly, he told me not to contact the neighbor anymore, to get a written/signed testimony from the witness neighbor, and to report any documents in the mail from either my neighbor or the company that did the job, as well as refusing contact should the neighbor come to my door. I asked if I could continue updating you all and he said that was fine so long as I don't disclose personal information (which I won't obviously!)

So it looks like I'm taking my neighbor's ass to court! I hope somehow I can get my trees back, even just having new ones planted. That area of my property is so barren now :'( I'll be sure to update if more information comes to light that I can share, and of course, if it gets there, to what happens when it's all over!

Her ""I love yous"" weren't as enthusiastic. The way she talks and communicates with me feels different. She easily gets upset over trivial things. She seems to be a different person all of a sudden.

* i cheated on him many times
* I cheated should we break up
* Breaking up a long term relationship... and so on

AITA for flipping out on old lady while my son was locked in hot car,"I have been brought up to respect my elders and have never done anything like this before. I think it was my adrenaline rushing and also I'm super emotional because I am pregnant again. Yesterday I took my baby to Kohl's and while getting his stroller unfolded from the truck, I fucked up bad. I left my purse with keys and phone in the car, with the baby (to keep him calm while I get stroller ready for him). I close my trunk, come around to his door and it's locked. Every door is locked. It's 85 degrees out and I'm just watching him play with my bag and I can't get in or call anyone. I immediately started screaming for help and a couple came over and called 911 and let me use their phone to call my husband. One guy ran to the autozone in the parking lot to see if they have something to break in. I was ready to break the window. People were running over and looking in my car, comforting me, calling for help. I was hysterical and nothing anyone said made me feel better. And then it happened: some older lady came up to the crowd and asked very loudly right next to me ""the parents went into shop and left the baby in the car- they should be ashamed of themselves"". And I lost it. I was screaming at her I don't remember what I said- I sort of blacked out. And it was in front of everyone there. I demanded she leave and go away. She was like my grandmas age. The police came and two guys each had this contraption of a balloon thing out between the car door and stuck a stick in to press the unlock button. From the first call to the door opening was 9 minutes but I thought it was an hour. The baby was alright, and never even cried. We hung out in the cop car to cool off while the crowd dissipated.

AITA for taking the office microwave?,"Over a year ago the microwave at my office died. The company refused to replace it. They said we could use money we earned for prizes to go towards that. This would take a long time. 

I wasn't having that. At the time I went out and spent about sixty dollars on a microwave. Initially I kept it at my desk, but everyone kept coming to use it. So I moved it to the office kitchen. 

Everyone who saw it at my desk is gone. It's just been ""the microwave"". Anyway, my wife and I bought a new house recently and it needs a microwave. Our new home is close enough to the office that I can commute home during lunch. So I took my microwave home. Generally speaking I close the office and I'm the last one here. I took it home when nobody else was here without saying a word. 

A lot of my peers are FURIOUS I ""stole"" my own microwave. Even the company owner and my manager are upset saying I snuck it out at the end of the day or that if I bought it for the office it should stay here. That was never my intention. I never communicated it , but I always meant to take my microwave home with me. It's not like sixty bucks is a lot of money but it's not an inconsequential amount. I dont see why they can't all chip in a bit and buy one that way. Five bucks each or something. I said that and again more angry reactions. 

The screwy thing is my wife is even on their side. Saying most people see it as company property and it's been there so long we should let it go and WE should buy another one. I'm not willing to budge here. It feels foolish that I should donate my personal property because people expect me to. 

AITA?

Edit: Thanks for the input on this one. I guess I was honestly an asshole here. I didn't intentionally bring it home in a way to actively make my coworkers uncomfortable but I think I was also stuck on the ""mine"" like a toddler. This is a bad situation for everyone. I'll take some time and reflect on bringing it back.

Edit 2 : Just to clarify my office has a lot of turnover. It was abundantly clear with that initial group of staff that if was my property. BUT since then it's a lot of new faces. Not justifying anything. Just providing more context to my actions.

Edit 3:
Obligatory ""this blew up way more than I expected!""

 A lot of people seem to be asking ""why doesn't your boss provide one"". I work in an insurance agency. We spend little time in office as possible. Especially the agents and financial advisors. The owner believes more creature comforts = more reason to stay in the office. She says that's how it was when she came into the business. Not a position I exactly agree with. it's nonsense to think a microwave will have a sharp decline in sales. At some level she is entitle to this opinion because she owns the business and she is the largest agent in the area by a very wide margin. Not justifying it. Just sharing. 

Right now I've asked around the office and sort of calmed the waters with most everyone sans 2 or 3 people. Most people took the apology in stride. A few are angry for the sake of it. Planning on confronting the owner at some point tonight. A few people are willing to split the cost but that's if she isn't willing to cave on the issue. Just wanted to add this.

Final update : Met with my boss. It was a very mixed bag. I read a lot of comments on and off today. I decided to throw some weight around. Telling her how much I've earned her what I've done. I basically laid it to the basics that it wasn't fair what she was doing. I told her she created this situation. I told her most people who produce at my level leave in 5 months for other companies. I asked her why I shouldn't go to the place everyone else leaves to. 

She didn't like that. She told me this is EXACTLY why she doesn't like appliances in the office. If it wasn't for clients she'd ditch the coffee machines and fridge too. We sort of went back and forth with this for a while. My boss asked me how would I like it if she went to my home and demanded I bring something in. She disclosed her annual salary. It's very similar to what I make. I called that bluff and asked about business profits. Told her she wouldn't run a company like that if she only made some 11k more than me. 

Negotiations broke down. At some point during this her assistant who's been with the company since day 1 went down the road and bought a microwave and toaster oven from a consignment shop a few blocks over using the imprest fund. She ended the conversation telling my boss ""quit your damn bickering and do some work so we can go home."" 

I feel bad about dragging my bosses assistant into it. That woman is a SAINT. But I suppose this is the desired outcome of it all.

I (m 31) am growing tired of my wife's (f 31) hangups on sex.....,"Ive been with my wife for about 15 years, if you include the time we dated. We have been married for 11 years in August. 

I love my wife, but the sex just fucking sucks. And it has sucked for the last 5 years or so. Every now and then she will get adventurous and try a different position, but its almost always missionary or ""doggy style"". Sometimes she gets on top, but its rare.

I constantly tell her how beautiful she is, I tell her how much she means to me, and I try my best to do whatever I can to lay signals that Im into her. I hug her, I stand close to her in public, I make it well known that Im pretty damn proud to be with her. 

She reciprocates none of it. She never comes on to me unless I straight up ask her to (seriously, Ill ask, ""can you do me tonight?"") she doesn't spontaneously get playful (in an adult way), she does not masturbate....^ever. I work long hours, and Ill come home and playfully ask if she got adventurous with any of the toys that we have (which are literally collecting dust, btw) and she just snips ""no"" in a fashion like it would be disgusting if she did so. She gets upset if I cum anywhere but inside her or out away from her, as its an inconvenience to be cummed on (one time she got pissed because she had just showered and I came on top of her pussy). She keeps the same positions, same setting (always on our bed, on my side), orgasms and goes to sleep. It fucking sucks. The sexiness factor is zero. I love that fucking woman to death but the intimacy isn't there at all and Im not sure I can do it anymore. Its like its a chore for her, and not something she looks forward to. 

Anywho, it came to head tonight. I asked her if we could, ya know, tonight before bed. She said yes. So the time comes, she was on me and I wasn't totally into it, so I started to get soft. I made up a bullshit excuse, and asked her to just stroke me to get me hard again (oral would be totally out, as I had been inside her, and that is an absolute no go zone for her, so I didn't ask). So she climbs off me and proceeds to take my cock in between her index finger and her thumb and stroke me as she didn't want to touch my dick because it had been inside her. I lost it. I said how depressing it was that she didnt even want to *touch* my dick after it had been inside her. This is supposed to be our sexy time and she is out here acting like everything is icky and Im fucking done with it. She has since rolled over and went to bed without saying goodnight.

I cant live like this. There is no adventure, no surprise, and no spontaneity.  Im too fucking young to be having old people sex for the next 20 years. This was probably more of a rant than an advice piece, but damn.

Tldr: I am married to my roommate who I occasionally have sugar free vanilla sex with.",relationship_advice
TIFU by taking a dump that destroyed part of my house,"Well, actually, Tuesday I fucked up by taking a shit that destroyed part of my house, but rule #4 prevented this post from happening for a couple days. In the end, that's probably a good thing for the post, because the shit was just the tip of the iceberg. I've been fucking up every day since when trying to deal with this.

Tuesday morning, about 3 AM, I wake up and go to the bathroom. I sit down and know I'm in for some trouble because this dump is large and about to punish my butthole. Some pain and minutes later, I finish up and flush the toilet. Clogged. I shut the rising water off, grab the plunger and get to work. That clog ain't budging. Screw this, it's 3am, I'll deal with it after I actually wake up. I go to work on it again in the morning. Still ain't budging. Screw it. I shower and go to work, I'll deal with it when I get home.

I get home, head into the bathroom. The bowl of the toilet reeks. It's lined with dry shit water. I turn the water back on to let it fill back up and rinse the bowl, then I go sit down and watch some TV. About 15 minutes later, I hear a loud crash. There always used to be loud crashes in this house with no explanation, we'd chuckle and say it must be the ghost. Without missing a beat, I chuckled and thought, ""must be the ghost."" About 1/2 an hour later, I had to piss, and remembered I needed to unclog a toilet too. I walk around the corner, open the door, and holy shit.

The toilet is running. The flapper never came down and it just kept filling and filling until the floor is covered in shit water. I start to panic and dash in, throw towels on the ground, it's not enough. I run into my bedroom and start grabbing old shirts to throw down. Still not enough. I run back and grab an old sheet and comforter off the bed. That manages what's on the floor. As I stand there wrapping my head around this, I remember the crash 1/2 an hour earlier. My eyes dart to A/C vent on the floor... motherfucker, who puts a vent on the floor? I do the math and take off down the steps into the basement.

HVAC ducts all over the floor. Shitty pouring down through where those pipes used to be, all over the wash and dryer, all over cardboard boxes, clothes, files, records. And then I grab a nearby stool and sit down and watch as the water slows to a steady drip. ""Oh. Shit. This is bad."" 

Mopped the basement up, and started to let it dry. Came back up stairs and went into the bathroom. Threw the shit water soaked rug into the tub. Continued cleaning up what water was left over with my soon to be trashed shirts and bed clothes. Go into my bedroom to sit down and take just take everything in again. ""Hm, this carpet is a little wet. Must have tracked some water in with me earlier."" Fuck up number two. And in the end, the grandest fuck up.

Later that night, I notice the carpet isn't really drying. The wet foot prints I left, they were starting to become pretty soggy. I grab a towel, drop it on top of it, and start trying to soak it up. Fuck up number three because there was no method to my madness. I should have been working from the outside in. Instead, I was just spreading all that water out. By the end of the night, two or three soggy foot prints becomes a giant puddle of shit water in my carpet that will not relent. I stay up until around 2 AM, going at it from the outside in this time, but the damage has already been done. I put a fan on it and go to bed.

Wake up Wednesday morning. It's pretty bad. On the way home from work, I swing by a hardware store to rent a wet vac. The internet seemed pretty high on these thing's ability to suck water out of a carpet. Six hours later, I've maybe sucked 1/2 gallon a of water out. In the end, I think it only made things worse as several spots seemed much wetter than before. That's what, TIFU #4?

Things didn't seem too bad on Thursday. With the exception of a couple spots, the carpet was just damp. I kept a fan on it when it wasn't covered. Washed and dried some towels, dropped them to soak and went out for a couple hours. I get home, and the smell of shit is permeating through the house. I didn't think to close off the few A/C vents that still work. 

Friday morning. The carpet smell begins to hit. It wasn't too strong though. I take to the internet again. If your carpet's a bit damp, what does the internet tell you to do? Baking soda! So I threw that baking soda down and left for work. Turns out baking soda will fuck up your vacuum cleaner. I guess that's not too serious because it's not like it'll do it right off that bat, but I just feel like this week keeps on kicking. At this point, I'm out of ideas. I'm pretty sure it's gone through to the subfloor. Tearing the carpet and padding up wasn't really an option to begin with, and now I'm taking a break from cleaning out my room and preparing to tear everything up. I am defeated. 

TL;DR: Took a shit that flooded my bathroom. It destroyed the insulation, A/C, a ton of possessions, and now the additional nightmare of my carpet. 

Edit: So this took off since I last got to check it. Thanks for the gold, whoever did that!

Yes, there is home owner's insurance. Things are going to get taken care of. I got bent on trying to take care of the carpet without removing everything from my bedroom. I get now that it's something I can't tackle by myself. Those of you who told me to get a dehumidifier right away to help dry things out and slow down or prevent things from happening, I did that. I don't really know what else I can offer in the way of an update right now?

Some people seemed bothered that this started on Tuesday and not today? Sorry? I checked the rules and they said that was okay.

Anyway, glad some people got a kick out of it. Thanks for the comments and advice.",tifu

Found cash in my walls. It's mine right? Can I deposit them in the bank & pay back my student loans? (Washington). Update: It is deposited and my student loans are paid back!,"[My question](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72wjbw/found_cash_in_my_walls_its_mine_right_can_i/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I watched the VHS tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. That's why he kept his savings in cash. He didn't even trust a safe deposit box. That's why they were kept in his walls. And it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. I found the other $20,000.

I went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. She talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

I scheduled an appointment with the bank. When I told them it's for a cash deposit they told me I don't need an appointment for that but I told them it's for a large deposit. They still said no appointment is necessary, but then I said it's a very large deposit. So they booked the appointment. Everything went smoothly at the bank. They made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. Money was in my account a few hours later.

I made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and I now have a larger emergency fund.

Thanks! ",legaladvice
AITA for cutting my mother out of my life for letting me be homeless?,"Back in 2009 when the economy tanked I lost my job, my car, my apartment, my girlfriend. Basically everything. At first I didn't want anyone to know what had happened so I stayed at a friends house for a week while I looked for a new job. But his landlord told me guests couldn't stay for more than 7 days at a time in a 30 day period. So I asked my mother if I could stay with her while I looked for a job. I told her I'd be on the street homeless if she didn't help me and she still decided to refuse to help me. Fast forward 2 months, I've been sleeping on the streets for every night still unable to secure a job. Even something like Safeway or McDonald's. My dad finds out that I'm homeless and sends me a ticket to come live with him in NJ and I accept. Within a week I have a job and in 3 months I'm in my own place again. It's been 10 years since then and I haven't spoken to my mother because of what I perceive to be a betrayal. She attempts to contact me frequently and I ignore it. AITA for cutting her out of my life? 

TL;DR mother let me be homeless and I never forgive her.

Edit: I have already cut ties. I haven't spoken to her in 10 years. It's my siblings telling me that I am the asshole that prompted this post.

Edit: people keep asking for her reasoning and all I can say is what she said to me. She said she couldn't afford to let me stay. But all I was asking for was a place to sleep. Not money, or food. I was getting a small unemployment check and eventually I got food stamps. I could have contributed. 

Edit: I guess I also have to say that I never asked my parents for anything. I've earned everything I have. I am not a drug user and I have never been. I don't drink and I've been the most responsible of all the children. Oh and my post should probably be she let me STAY homeless instead of let me be homeless.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by nearly bleeding to death after having sex with my wife (NSWF),"I like to eat in bed.  Little did I know it would almost kill me. This fine evening I decided to make myself a few sandwiches and sit in bed while browsing the internet. After finishing my sandwiches I put my ceramic plate on my nightstand next to the bed.  Brushed my teeth and went to sleep. 

Next morning I'm pretty horny and roll over and initiate with my wife. We do the deed and end up mostly on my side of the bed. After I finished I roll off her and intend to roll to the side of the bed with my butt on the edge and feet hanging off so I'm basically sitting on the edge of the bed. Well, I misjudged it and fell right off the bed. In the process of falling I knocked off the plate and proceeded to land directly on top it. Naturally it shatters. I felt no pain so my first thought was ""damn, that was close."" My wife asks if I'm ok so I look down and see a large gash on my right knee cap, which for some reason wasn't bleeding, a profusely bleeding puncture in my thigh next to my knee, and on my left foot, two more punctures that were mildly bleeding. 

Shit. Is this how it's going to end, bleeding out on my bedroom floor while butt naked?  I tell my wife no, I'm not ok and urgently tell her to drive me to the ER.  She doesn't realize how badly I'm bleeding since I'm putting pressure on my leg with a towel I found nearby, and proceeds to slowly get the kids ready and in the car before helping me put on some shorts, a shirt, and helps me down the stairs and into the car. 

We get to the ER and by that time I've miraculously stopped heavily bleeding. I find a wheelchair and wheel myself to the front desk to check in. Since I'm not noticeably bleeding anymore they didn't give me priority. Eventually I check in and they ask what happened. I tell them exactly what happened except I left out the sex part. They legitimately did not believe me and asked if my wife did it. My wife then happened to walk in with the kids after parking the car so I motioned to her and told the receptionist ""no, this is kind of embarrassing, but we had just had sex and I rolled off the bed, etc.""  

At this point a few other ER personnel overheard and started cracking up. The receptionist loudly asked my wife across the room ""if it was true."" My wife embarrassingly nodded her head.

I get admitted and they remove the plate shards, stitch me up, and tell me to practice safe sex in the future since I literally could have died had the plate hit my artery. 

PS - we told our kids that mom and dad were ""wrestling."" They still like to talk about how mom threw dad off the bed while wrestling and sent me to the hospital. It'll be fun once they're old enough to realize what we were actually doing. 

Tl;dr - left a ceramic plate on my nightstand. Had sex with my wife the next morning, fell off the bed, knocked over the plate, landed on the shattered plate, cut open my knee, thigh, foot, went emergency room, they didn't believe me and thought my wife did it at first. Gave them a good laugh when they realized I was telling the truth.",tifu

TIFU my childs life (NSFW)," Tuesday I fucked up by posting this story without reading the sidebar. Sorry. But alas, it's the weekend and anything goes, so I'm reposting it.



 Today I fucked up big. Oh man, where to begin. It all happened so fast, and fell apart so early. I'll start by saying I've been single for about two years now. I settled down early, at 14, and then spent the next 20 years with the same chick. Since she left, I've been forced to rediscover myself as an individual. I'll get to the point. The one thing I actually enjoy about being single is the fact that I can fart whenever and however loud I want. I want to fart on my kids? No problem. I want to Dutch oven myself? Absolutely, smells great. I want to hard fart on the couch? Please do.


Two a.m. last night seven year old daughter, Grace, has a nightmare and joins me in my bed. Six a.m. Half asleep and I make perhaps the worst decision of my life. I should mention here that I get the occasional bout of constipation. Yesterday was day four so I decided to take a laxative to ease things along a bit. The instructions said take between one and three for ""natural relief"". Six p.m. last night I took the three and waited for my ""natural relief"". Back to six a.m. Grace is the big spoon and I feel a hard fart coming on. Half way between consciousness and slumber I push a hard one out. I feel a HOT, not warm, hot, and wet, liquid THEW shoot out of me. Grace comes to and is covered from mid chest to knees in hot yellowish daddy shart. It shot clear through my pajamas. She wipes the sand out of her eyes and you can see it clicking on her head. She glances down and looks like she just found her pet's decapitated head next to her. She immediately starts screaming. Her screams turn to tears as she stands up in the middle of my bed, dripping dad's colon sludge. She's screaming and crying, I'm apologizing and crying. All of this wakes up the five year old boy. He groggily stumbles into the bedroom and when he realizes what's happening, proceeds to full-on bend-over guffaw. I'm now holding my still exploding ass, Grace is losing it on my bed, and the boy can barely breathe as I make my way towards the bathroom. I get to the door where my son is, and before I can waddle past him, I notice his pants are wet. This boy laughed so hard, and on a count of the early hour, he pissed himself. ""David, you're pissin yourself!"" I scream ironically, whilst holding my shit filled jammies. He responds by laughing harder, falling on the floor, curling up into the fetal position, and continuing to empty his bladder. I'm in tears and covered in shit, Grace is in tears covered in shit, David is laughing hysterically in a pool of his own piss, and the dog starts to bark. My oldest daughter is home sick from school and wakes up in the commotion, and is now watching all of this like a horrified deer caught in the headlights. 90 minutes later, David has finally calmed down, everyone has showered and it's fucking silent as I try to feed them breakfast. A quiet ride to school an hour late and we have to stop by the office to get a note. The attendance secretary asks David why he's late and he busts out laughing again. Grace looks at me and screams ""don't tell them anything"", and goes tearing down the hall towards her class. It takes another three solid minutes to calm David down. I'm sure he went right in to class and told everyone. Grace hasn't said a word to me or made any eye contact with me since this morning. I think I may have really damaged her. I don't know if I can somehow blame all this on being a single dad to garner some sympathy, but I'll try. I'd hard being a single dad; even harder to look your daughter in the eyes after shitting on her. Ok, now comes the really bad part. Today is Grace's eighth birthday.





UPDATE: Grace said nothing to me on Tuesday, didn't look at me either. I gave her space and she kept to herself. Not her brother or sister, she didn't even want anything to do with the pets. The kids go with their mom on Wednesdays and I pick them up from school again Fridays. Since her birthday fell on a week day, we're celebrating it this weekend and I need to make this one count.


 Thursday morning I get a phone call from her mother that wakes me up. I'm sleeping on the floor as my mattress is in the backyard waiting for a truck to take it to the dump. I can't tell you how much I dreaded answering that call. This is not going to be a positive conversation. I answer the phone to a good four seconds of silence.


""Hello?""


One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand.


""WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU LET SARTRE SLEEP IN YOUR BED TO SHIT ALL OVER OUR DAUGHTER ON HER FUCKING BIRTHDAY, ASSHOLE!!!?""


Wait, what? Did Grace lie to her mother or does she actually believe that the dog did this to us? Is her little eight year old brain too naive to comprehend her daddy sharting all over her? I mean it was early. It was a confusing fucking mess, but could she have been that confused? I never said I shit on her, just apologized. I thought it was obvious.  Maybe she thinks I was apologizing for letting the dog sleep in the bed.  My mind is racing as the ex continues to ream me.  Perhaps that's why Grace didn't want anything to do with the dog and ignored everyone. I apologize to the ex, and she finishes up yelling at me as I explain that I didn't even know Sartre was sick and maybe that's why he jumped into bed, to let me know he was sick. (Is this working, is Graces mom actually buying this shit? Am I actually getting away with this? All of this rushes through my head as I put forth the sick dog hypothesis.) I picked up Grace today from school. She seems o.k. She's talked to me a little. Just demands though, ""I'm hungry,"" ""can we change the channel?"" that sort of thing. I don't dare push the subject too hard, (after all, pushing got me into this predicament in the first place), but I'm kinda dying to know if she knows that it was me. How do you broach that subject with someone? Should I count my blessings and let it go? Do I just sacrifice the dog like that; Sartre taking one for the team, literally not existentially? The existence of the shit precedes the essence of my guilt, or something like that.  Maybe I'll just save the 'I shit on you on your eighth birthday' bombshell for her 18th birthday. Fucking parenthood, huh?
   

Edit: tl;dr. I woke up this morning and covered my seven, now eight year old in a hard shart.
Edit 2: I've tried to fix the formatting, I wrote this in word and it got screwed up in transition

Can't wait until Thursday....My(48M) wife(44F) is going to be SHOCKED,"[**\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

So, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.

Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......

I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

Fast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

Our ""New"" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.

Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.

\*Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING.  So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then.  (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from ""How I Met Your Mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*Edit 3 - And to those of you saying ""I"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  She is my hero.  I wake up every day to earn her all over again.  This was one small thing I was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why I have a heartbeat.  And I don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if I seem sappy.  If a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

TL;DR Wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, I went Hardy Boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  Was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

AITA for not being attracted to my girlfriend's body?,"I made an ALT account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
I'm also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so I'll try to keep it as PG as I can.

So, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
I will say that she's the first thin person I've ever been with. She's flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I've been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I've always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
This all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She's always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she's not attractive if she doesn't have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.
I told her I had to be honest, and said that I'm not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b-bs. It's not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I'm being honest, that's why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
She was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we've been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn't know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).

Am I being the asshole here?

I (27F) am being asked to use my personal computer and download a tracker for work,"Hello,

As the post says I am a 27 year old family nurse practitioner in **Virginia**. I work in private practice, think family doctor, and my company from the beginning has required me to use my own personal computer. When I was hired I wasn't told about that, but instead on the first day, they told me to bring it and use it daily as it needs to go in with me to see the patients. I think this is crazy for a variety of reasons- lots of wear/ tear that I'm not compensated with, bring back/ forth- risk of losing it or it being stolen, patient's records on my personal computer, sick people getting germs on my computer and on and on. I have been at this position for 5 months and so far the mouse pad has stopped working because my hands are always wet with hand sanitizer. So then I had to buy a wireless mouse. I have a nice computer and I hate that it's being ""destroyed"" like this.

&#x200B;

Today I have strep. Strep as an adult is terrible. I told my boss I could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. That night on the phone she said yes please work from home. First thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. It is a google chrome timer extension. I told them that I would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but I was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. She said OK, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since I wouldn't install the timer and that I was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

&#x200B;

This is on top of the fact that I have to clock in/ clock out on an app on my phone that tracks my gps. Yes, I have a master's degree and have to clock in/out even for lunch. During the entire time it is on, gps is tracked.

&#x200B;

So listen, I know I need a new job but- is this legal? How do I approach this? I am now going to have to use sick/vacation time that I wasn't planning on using. I think I should be paid for my time today.

I (26M) just broke up with my GF (26F). She was raped a year ago and my entire family hates me now.,"For background, I have been with my GF for 4 years. I realise she is technically my ex-GF, but it feels weird saying that, so I will just call her my GF.

Anyway we have been together for 4 years, and everything was amazing up until a year ago. She went to a party without me, drank way more than she should have, and was sexually assaulted by two of the men there. Both men were identified by people at the party, plead guilty, and convicted. 

After this my GF's personality completely changed. She no longer showed any affection to me and was, all things considered, very cold to me. She tried to blame it on me since I didn't go with her, something which I have always found fucked up. Even though she stopped showing me any affection, she got 100x more clingy in insisting I'm always with her, which wouldn't be so bad if she at least showed some affection when I'm around her.

We have never had any kind of sex since the incident. She very occasionally gives me a kiss, but only a kiss and nothing more. I can 100% understand her feeling uncomfortable with being intimate after what she went through, but she has made literally no attempt in the past year to work on this, or at least try and be intimate with me.

She has been going to therapy this entire time, but she is still as cold and distant to me as she was a year ago. I feel like she's not even my GF anymore, just a clingy loner that sucks the life out of me. I have tried to talk to her about how our relationship is suffering, but I have to stop because she immediately starts crying and asking me to forgive her, only for her to make no attempt to change afterwards.

As you can tell from my rambling tone, I am no longer happy in this relationship, and after making many attempts to help her I feel as though I need  to move on. I'm only getting older and I want to start a family and raise kids, and I feel as though there's no chance of that happening with her now in the state she's in.

So I broke up with her last week. I was straight to the point and then left without comforting her, because I knew that once she started crying and begging me to stay I'd eventually give in. I feel as though I've done enough to try and save this relationship and simply need to move on.

Ever since this my entire family has literally cut me out of their life. My mother and 3 sisters all blocked me on Facebook/WhatsApp and wont return my calls. The only message I got was an extremely upsetting email from my mum telling me how heartless I am for abandoning my GF when she needs me most. My dad passed away a few years ago so they are the only family I have. I feel as though I have to go back to my GF, who in all honestly makes me feel like shit when I'm around her, if I want to maintain a relationship with my family.

I am considering buying a plane ticket to go home so I can confront my mother in person, but other than that I have no idea what the fuck I am supposed to do. Probably a long shot but if anyone has any ideas on how I can repair my relationship with my family without getting back together with my GF, I'd much appreciate it.",relationship_advice

I (33 F) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 M) and I are indian. He thinks I've cheated, meanwhile I'm worried i was raped. i haven't talked to my husband since he left the hospital and i don't know what to do

throwaway because who wants this disaster on their mane account?

A little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)

We've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.

we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.

Things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. So when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.

I'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. At first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.

I can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! He stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.

its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and I'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think I'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.

I haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? I'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?

what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.

what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? Will i have to quit?

i dont even know what any of you can do but i feel like I'm drowning.

UPDATE: I'm still reading through all the responses, thank you so much. I had no idea i would get so much help and answers.

I've decided I'm going to send my husband this post, and ask for a paternity test. I'm hoping what you've said will convince him to come back to me.

AITA for withholding information about my work from my husband?,"Throwaway because my husband checks up on my main account. Background information:  I am 28.  He is 30.  I'm a lawyer.  He works in business and is getting his MBA at night. Last semester, he took a ""business law"" class for business students (this is relevant). 

A few months ago, I stopped providing real answers when my husband would ask me about how work was going or if I had anything exciting come up.  He's always had a tendency to try to tell me how to resolve situations at work, which is super annoying because he has no idea what he's talking about, but it's gotten so much worse since he took this stupid business law class.  He now thinks that he is an expert on law and lectures me about it.  I wasn't even telling him detailed stuff about my cases.  Our conversations would go like this:

>Me: I have to go to court tomorrow.  
>  
>Him: State court or federal court?  
>  
>Me: State court.  
>  
>Him: Why don't you remove the case to federal court?  You know, you can do that by (insert long lecture that is littered with mistakes).  
>  
>Me: Because the federal court doesn't have jurisdiction and, even if it did, I wouldn't want to do that because (explanation).  
>  
>Him: Well that's really stupid. (Insert more lecturing).

I told him to knock it off a few times but he said that he was ""just trying to help."" So, I stopped telling him anything about work.  I know that probably wasn't very mature of me but that's what I did.

This was working out great for me until last night, when we had dinner with my parents.  My mom brought up a recent win that I had mentioned to her in passing but had not told my husband about.  He handled it very gracefully while we were at dinner but when we got home, he made it clear that he was very hurt that I hadn't told him about this.  Now I feel like an asshole because I prioritized my comfort over his feelings but at the same time I really do not want to go back to listening to his long lectures.  AITA?

"My childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. Except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. [NSFW]","[UPDATE HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

So, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, Sarah [31F], my long-time partner, John [34M], and myself [29F].

I've known that Sarah has had a crush on John for a long time. It's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, Sarah has never crossed any boundaries. But because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(My boyfriend and I had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

Apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

Which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while I'm sleeping. She took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. She apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

I found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

Now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad I'm being abused.

But here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. He took the photos and videos *for me*. The day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so I can watch them because it's better than porn. 

But nobody believes me. They're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. I don't know what to do. I'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

How do I fix my friendships and convince everybody that **I'M** the one who wanted it? 

There is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but I do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. I'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

Please help. I'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

Edit: since this needs to be said, YES, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. It's a four digit code.

Edit edit: 

- yes, I *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- I have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. Just *mostly* everybody. I was upset and generalizing last night.

- I am in the US.

- my boyfriend **DOES HAVE A PASSCODE** on his phone. Seriously. Stop blaming him. This is *definitely* not his fault.

Edit AGAIN since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and I: we attended a BBQ where EVERYBODY left their phones inside. We *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

You guys are being a little mean about this.

**Edit** (again): 

Went to the police and will update when I can.

## MINOR UPDATE 

I went to the police last night, alone. After everything that was said, I was nervous about having John with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

Really. Y'all made me nervous.

I went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

At first, the officer at the window was like, ""I think that's a crime? Maybe? I've gotta call my supervisor.""

That happened twice before the police were like, Okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. We're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

I gave my report and left. About fifteen minutes later, I got a phone call from the local PD. They told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

My comments being that Sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue John and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

They suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. Well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, I'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

So, that's about it. 

A bunch of hemming and hawing and I don't knows. They'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

I'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.",relationship_advice
I sued Equifax and won. They filed an appeal. What's next?,"I'm in California and I sued Equifax via small claims court and got my judgement at end of October.  From what I've read, Equifax has 30 days before I can start collecting.

However, a couple weeks ago they've served me an appeal but the service paper does not have a new court date.  The service paper said to not contact the small claims court and the court will contact me.  How long do I wait?

Update:
- I checked my case status and got this
https://imgur.com/a/Ve7m4

Does this mean the court rejected the appeal?  Oh nevermind, Equifax probably just didn't pay for their appeal.  But does that mean they didn't file within 30 days so they're SOL?

Judgement was on 10/25 so did Equifax screwed up?

https://imgur.com/a/wU0eh

Update for new comers:

- Judgement is $360 + court fees on 10/25.

- Equifax served me Appeal on 11/8 via USPS.

- Clerk sent rejection letter for non payment of filing fees on 11/15

- It's been more than 30 days, time to collect?!?!

- The main basis of my case was that I should be able to choose my own credit monitoring service rather than use a service that's ran by Equifax, the company who lost my data in the first place.  The service offered by Equifax does not fully cover all credit bureaus in the US. They admit it as well and it's on their service description.

- Sounds to me like this won't fly as well in Civil court so I will probably try to find a legal angle to this.

- Obviously if I do come up with any argument I may not post it here since Equifax may be reading, sorry guys.  I'm only disclosing what I've already disclosed prior to today.

- Step by step process will be reserved for when I do get to collection to not encourage others to follow suit.  While I welcome what's to come, it may not be in your best interest and like others have said, even I might be in over my head.  Oh well.

- Worse case scenario, I lose $150 to Equifax for court fees due to:
> Code of Civil Procedure sections 116.780 and 116.790. Section 116.780(c) provides that the court may award the winning party attorney's fees actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the appeal, but not exceeding $150 (as well as lost earnings and transportation/lodging expenses not exceeding an additional $150). Section 116.790 allows the court, if it finds the appeal ""was without substantial merit and not based on good faith, but was intended to harass or delay the other party, or to encourage the other party to abandon the claim,"" discretion to award the other party actual, reasonable fees that do not exceed $1,000 (as well as an additional $1,000 in lost earning and transportation/lodging expenses).",legaladvice
AITA for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner,"Ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


Rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. She would make noises in between conversations like ""Bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""Awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. This is especially embarrassing when I am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


I have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. I have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


It was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. We went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""Yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. Owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""


Seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. I rolled my eyes and told her:


""I am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. Please excuse me.""

TIFU by complimenting a co-worker on his weight loss,"This happened just moments ago.

I have a co-worker that works in a separate department.  In my old position we had to communicate fairly regularly, but since changing positions I rarely see him.  It has been about a year and a half since I have seen him and I was surprised to see him in my area today.  He has lost about a hundred pounds so I thought it would be a nice gesture to recognize and compliment him.  I said it was good to see him again and rather enthusiastically told him he looks great and to keep up the hard work.  He responded with a cold smile, said it was nice running into me, and just continued walking.  We aren't incredibly close but we usually stop for small talk, which I was completely expecting as I awkwardly stood in the hallway.  

When I got back into my office I brought up the weight loss to my office-mate and said our coworker really looked great, and he was inspiring.  My office-mate somberly responded that he was diagnosed with cancer and has been losing the weight because of that.  

TL;DR I enthusiastically complimented a co-worker about his weight loss, got a cold response, then learned he was diagnosed with cancer.",tifu

She agreed I could have some so I did. She's out for a for days and my temptation got the best of me, so I ate the rest of an almost full packet.

Fuck, it was already gone, so I've just rushed to the shop to get a new one in expectance that I'm a dead man when she gets back. 

She once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so I'm not taking chances.

Toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. Not sure if I should put it in the Swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that I bought I new one.

I am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents. My step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses. Can someone help me please?,"I am really sorry if this is long but i have no idea where to turn to get help. I am also sorry if screw up terms. I am a minor, and i am about to start my last year of high school. I am currently living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

My mom passed away when i was 2 and we lived in Vancouver at the time. My dad remarried when i was 8 and i ended up becoming the youngest kid in the family. My step mom has always been mentally unstable and hates me in general.

My dad passed away \~6 years ago from cancer. Before my dad passed away he told me that there was a trust setup for me with a fair amount of money to pay for my university from his first wife. He also told me that his will was setup to ensure that i wouldn't need to worry about anything for university or need to worry about money. He told me over and over that i would be taken care of no matter what.

Earlier this month my step mom made a comment vaguely asking how i expected to pay for college/university on minimum wage. I told her what my dad told me, and she said that everything my dad had left was spent to take care of the family, and to send my older step siblings to university (she said it was ""first come, first serve""). She also has absolutely refused to help me in anyway as it is ""waste of her time"". I have ripped apart the house trying to find any sort of paperwork from my mom/dads estate but i cannot find anything.

I have tried to talk 2 lawyers who specializes in estates and wills, the first one told me he could not do a consult with a minor unless my guardian is present (no chance). The other one basically wanted a lot of money to even do anything which i don't have.

I have also tried to reach out to my estranged part of my moms family, her sister was able to dig up something with the name of the company who took care of her estate, but that company no longer seems to exist. My dad on the other hand was an only child, and as long as i remember i don't remember anyone else from his family, nor can i find anything.

I don't really know where to look or what to do at this point anymore. I am terrified that my step mother used this money to pay for all the frivolous bullshit she has wasted money on and pay for my step siblings tuition. I am also terrified that if there is really no money then i am basically going to get screwed hard, i need to get away from my step mother no matter what.

TLDR; I am supposed to have money in a trust/will from both of my parents. My step mom says this is not true and all the money left by my dad was used to take care of the family and pay for my step siblings tuition. I don't know how to find out the truth or where to even start looking.",legaladvice

TIFU by having a hotdog eating contest before a dentist appointment,"This actually happened in second grade. It was hotdogs for lunch at school, which were my favorite food by far. My friend knew this and bet me I couldn't eat 4 hotdogs, so I said let's just have a competition. Close to five hotdogs in I conceded the match. Not bad for a 7 year old, but my skinny little friend ended up eating like 6 of them.

So I'm not exactly feeling top notch after all those dogs and then halfway through our next class there's a knock on the door and it's my mom. I'm confused and then it dawns on me that she had told me this morning that I had a dentist appointment in the afternoon (I was a spacey kid and had forgotten).

We drive to the dentist and the motion of the car really wasn't sitting well with me but I figure I'll be fine once we arrive. Wait for a bit in the lobby and that classic dentist office smell really isn't helping anything in the nausea department. Finally my name is called so I hop in the chair, get through the pleasantries, am starting to feel a bit better and think it'll be a breeze. Dentist puts on his latex glove, I open my mouth, and he's barely gets his finger not even an inch in my mouth when it all falls apart.

I watch in slow motion horror as I feel my gag reflex engage, see the dentist's eyes shift to quizzical concern and then wide-eyed ""oh no"" shock as I projectile vomit an entire stomach full of hotdogs everywhere. Ev. Ry. Where. The room looked like a hotdog vomit grenade went off and no one was spared. I distinctly remember vomit dripping from the dentist's mask and my only thought being ""so that's what those are for."" Everyone froze, completely silent, all of us mortified and no one having a clue what to do. Finally the dentist shakes his head, calmly turns around and leaves the room. My mom grabbed me and took me straight home, not a word. I never saw that office again.

Part of me thinks this doesn't belong in TIFU since hotdogs are awesome and dentists and school sucks and I got a ton of the former and none of the latter out of that day. I'll let you guys decide though.

TIFU by writing official mails to people and not realising my profile picture is literally me grabbing a friend's butt,"So a couple of weeks ago, I finally setup my apple-id. I also put up some random photo of myself. For whatever reason, I just picked the first image that popped up, which happened to be a shot of me grabbing one of the lads's bum. I had cropped said friend out of the picture to make it be of my face only, thinking nothing of it.

&#x200B;

Since then, I've been applying to graduate schools and a few institutes (trying to break into sciences/research).

&#x200B;

Only now has it come to my attention that apple displays this picture in mails, too. Now, I was like, eh not a big deal, right? FUCKING WRONG. Apparently, it displays the FULL IMAGE - NOT the cropped one, but the FULL thing! I've been sending out fucking official mails with this thing for a couple of weeks now. I've been trying to get in contact with important people and universities for weeks, all this time giving these people a nice handy view of me groping this guy. Fucking fantastic way to kick off professional relations, this.

TIFU (NSFW) by forgetting that my boyfriend creampied me last night and going to my gynecologist's appointment.,"Before everyone freaks out - yes, I am on birth control. Also, apologies on format because of mobile blah blah.

This happened 30 minutes ago. I'm currently sitting in my car outside my gynecologist's office typing this.

My boyfriend and I both lead pretty busy lives. He works full time and often works overnight shifts. On the other hand, I'm a full time student that works 30-35 hours a week. On top of that, I had to put down my beloved fur child last Saturday, so as expected, he hasn't really been putting his wand in my Chamber of Secrets..if you catch my drift.

After an emotionally draining week, filled with lots tears and interspersed with sexual frustration, we finally had some time last night to, in Conan O'Brien's words, ""take grandma to Applebee's."" It's been a while since we had sex and my bf is not a fan of hand to gland combat, so unsurprisingly, he had a huge load.. As in, I felt his dick spasms as he shot ropes of jizz in me. When I was cleaning myself up after, I noticed just how much was coming out of me and when I told him he laughs it off and says,"" Haha, yeah, that was a lot.""

Anyways, this morning I check my calendar and of course I have a gyno appointment. I'm the type of person that gets really anxious for any type of appointment and while psyching myself out for my handsome and young male gyno to take a peek at my vagooba, I completely forget about last nights sexscapade. 

Fast forward to the appointment and everything seems normal. I guess my gyno was training a Physician's Assistant because she was the one that did my pap smear. 

For the dudes reading this, a pap smear is when us ladies have to channel our inner Sasha Grey and lay on our backs with our legs spread wide open for our gynecologists' viewing pleasure. They then stick a speculum in, open up our love canals, and blindly stick a bristle-like swab in to take cultures. Ya know, nothing's better than having a complete stranger stick random objects up your terrified vag while they try to hold a conversation with you - always a good time.

Anyways, as she sticks the speculum in, her soft virgin eyes look mortified. My experienced gyno just carries on, asking me questions (keep in mind that he was not behind her but was to my left). Midway he stops, walks over to take a quick look, smirks, and goes,"" Do you finally have a bf?"" (It's worth noting that he's a really cool gyno and obviously, I must talk to him about my sex life every check up; at this point, I wasn't sure if he had actually seen the semen inside me or was just making small talk). I awkwardly answer ""yes"" and he gives me his spiel about continuing my birth control/being careful. The new PA still looks semi-disgusted but has finished and is now pulling out the speculum. That's the EXACT moment that my soul leaves my body. As she pulls it out to throw in the trash behind her, I see my boyfriend's freaking baby batter DRIPPING off this thing into the floor. Once the speculum was removed, I proceed to feel a gush of liquid rush out of my pink canoe and pool around my butt. Yes, I was still spread eagle and you can bet that they both saw. 

The poor PA looks at my gyno and asks,"" Did you want me to clean that?,"" referring to what dripped on the floor. Before he could answer, I made a strange ass sound and rushed out,"" It's okay, I'll do it.""

Before they leave, my gynecologist winks at me and says,"" Guess your dry spell is finally over!"" We speak casually like friends so I'm not weirded out or anything but so embarrassed.

Guys.. I am seriously fucking horrified. What the fuck. I'm seriously considering switching gyno's but mine is so damn good at his job and we really get along. 

Also, not using a throwaway because I have no shame.

TL;DR: Boyfriend blew a huge load in me last night, went to the gynecologist today, and his cum literally gushes out of me.

EDIT: For those of you suggesting that this is an April Fools joke.. it is unfortunately not. My dignity is in shambles but I'm glad a few of you were able to laugh, cry, and cringe with me.

Also, yes, I did shower. My after-sex routine always involves a shower where I proceed to push my pelvic floor muscles like I am a reborn Christian, trying to expel the demon spawn that my sinful boyfriend had pushed into me. Although a hefty amount DID come out last night, apparently, not all of it. Contrary to popular belief, cooter's are not wide, gaping holes, with lips that flap whenever there's a breeze. Washing the outside of your vagina does not clean the INSIDE which, if you're not dipping your 'nana into the Nutella jar, is where the semen goes. A pap smear looks at the inside of the vagina and a speculum is an instrument that basically spreads open the walls of your tight vagina so the gynecologist can get a better look at your cervix.

In my case, just like ~~Noah~~ Moses, that speculum split the waves and onto the path that was just formed, onward gushed my beloved boyfriend's high fructose porn syrup. 

EDIT 2: For those that don't believe this is true.. or that I am female (grrls don't use the the interwebz hurrhurr), here are the screenshots of me talking to my boyfriend after.

EDIT 3: For those that STILL don't believe me:

Also, please don't speak badly about my gynecologist. You may think it's unprofessional but I've been seeing him for years now (prior to my bf, I was single for 3 years and I'm not one to partake in one night stands) and we're really close. As part of a regular check up for STD screening, he always asked if I have engaged in any sexual activity and for three years, I'd say no then tell him how much I longed for a relationship. If this happened in one of our first appointments, he would have NEVER acted like this. I have PCOS/am high risk for cervical cancer so I am constantly there for testing, ultrasounds, and general check ups regarding birth control/Metformin/etc. (we're still working on a method to regulate my period). He's become really close to me and we always joke around because it eases my nerves. It took us a while to get as comfortable as we are with each other and I wouldn't change it for the world. Though it'll always be nerve wracking to see any kind of physician ESPECIALLY a gynecologist, for me, it really helps that I view him as a friend. 

To clarify, bf and I had sex around 3am last night, I cleaned up, then we went to bed. Today (or I guess yesterday since it's 12:33am right now), was my day off so I legitimately woke up and Netflixed in bed all day until around 1 pm since my appointment was at 2.

Believe me or not, that's up to you. All I'm saying is I swear on my beloved fur baby's soul that it happened and I am still super embarrassed. In the years that I've been his patient, I have never seen this young female PA before. I do not know if this was the first time she encountered a situation like this but from the look on her face, I can only guess. I'm sure she'll become seasoned in time and things like this wil not phase her. The PA gave me my pap smear and I had to come back in a week to get an ultrasound for my PCOS anyway so if results were unclear due to semen, I'm sure we will redo the pap smear. My appointment was at 2pm but I was not seen until 3pm due to him having an emergency regarding a patient to attend to at the hospital so the exam was very rushed since he had a full waiting room. However, I'll be sure not to have PiV sex for at least 48 hours prior (very thankful for this advice as I genuinely did not know and this was my first visit where I am in a relationship ever).

I honestly was NOT expecting this to blow up like this in anyway.. I never even really post on Reddit, hence not using a throwaway since nobody knows I have this account *shrugs*. I guess this will become my ""throwaway"" account now since all this attention is making me a bit uncomfortable.

Some of you are criticizing my writing style and that's okay. I decided to have some fun with this post since it honestly was an awkward situation. I also happen to be a fan of euphemisms and personally challenged myself to use as many as I could. Sorry to those that felt it was hard to read or cringey and thanks to those that light heartedly laughed with me. I appreciate all of you - both the bad and good comments.

It was nice feeling semi-popular for one day, as things have been pretty gloomy around here ever since my dog died but some of your comments have really brightened my day.

My (26F) husband (31M) cheated at his bachelor party,"I don't know what to do. We got married in December and things were perfect. We've been together since I was 23. 

His friend is getting married and I noticed one of his other friends give my husband a funny look when talking about the new bachelor party. Like raising his eyebrows and laughing. My husband did not react and ignored him but I knew something was up. 

We allow each other on our phones so he was sleeping one night, I was awake, I saw it and got tempted. Went through messages and pictures. I saw a few things in his photos in the ""hidden"" album, he didn't really hide it too well but we don't go on each other's phones so he probably thought he was fine. I saw a video and a couple of pictures of a girl blowing my husband. It was fucking disgusting. He actually bought me a necklace when he came back, just realized he probably felt guilty or something. 

I read through his messages and saw his friends mentioning the party while planning the new one. He apparently snorted coke off some girls boobs too. My husband was telling them to forget about it and it was a long time ago and he was just having fun for one night and it would never happen again and he's committed to our marriage. He is so full of shit 

And I got pregnant on our honeymoon. I don't know what to do. How do I bring it up. What do I say. I feel so sick and dizzy ever since I found out. And I was at home, having a quiet tea party with my friends, opening up presents and talking about house decor. I feel so fucked over!! I can't believe he would do this to me",relationship_advice

so it's been 2 weeks since i posted.

i talked to my bf the day after and basically said what everyone else already commented and what i was thinking. no, i didn't secretly record her because that didn't sit right with me. i told him her behavior was making me super uncomfortable and that he needed to set boundaries with her asap, or i wasn't going to put up with it anymore. i was fucking pissed while telling him this and he got the message. he texted her in front of me and even let me read it. i was satisfied and very relieved. felt like i could finally breathe.

best friend came over a few times and was very nice to me. she wasn't being inappropriate even once, very respectful of the boundaries we had set. when we were alone she was the same girl as when we were all together. total 180. great. i was sooo glad and happy. thought she got the hint.

skip to yesterday. boyfriend is in the shower and left his phone in his pants on the floor. phone keeps vibrating and im getting annoyed. i grab his phone, all the messages are from best friend. there are pics of them fucking, a video i didn't watch and a lot of lovey dovey messages. i scrolled back and it went back to at least 2 months ago until i had enough and had an emotional breakdown. serious plans together, honestly i never came even came up in their conversations. he came back from the gym last night. we were going to have sex after he got out of the shower. and he had been fucking here minutes before he came home. 

im staying with a friend for a while. had to take work off today because im a total wreck. honestly im still in shock, i seriously can't comprehend what's going on. haven't responded to any of bfs messages but he knows i know, he hasn't said anything after he realized it i think. well this confirmed for me im not as desirable as i thought, funny how i genuinely believed he chose for me. i cant even start to explain how shit i feel. started drinking but luckily i have my friend here who is taking care of me, bless her.

(Unsure if its unpopular or not) Police officers should get tougher sentences than civilians when committing a crime.,"Since its tougher sentence to assault a police officer than a civilian, and officers vowed to stop crimes, I think it's more than fair and logical that police officers should receive a tougher sentence than a civilian when committing a crime. As it is right now its usually the other way around.

TIFU by not wiping my bum on the bus.,"This happened about 15 minutes ago and I'm still practically doubled over.

So, as with the Winter season (well tbh basically every season for me), I've got the common cold, which paired with my asthma makes me a joy to be around on the bus.

For a bit of background, my nose and sinuses are pretty solidly packed, my nose streams like a tap, and my voice keeps breaking because of the phlegm in my throat.

Anyway, I get a bus to work in the morning because I can't drive (currently learning to) and it's packed with the usual odd squad and gawkers. So, I step on the bus, swipe my pass, and go and sit down on the bottom level (double decker bus), and pull my phone out to join the internet for the day.

I realise about 5 minutes into the journey that my nose has started leaking, as it's dripping on my phone screen, so I lean over and reach into my back pocket where I keep loose tissues. I'm practically rubbing my back pocket for 5 minutes trying to get these tissues out, but they're caught between my coat and my belt, which is forcing them down the back of my trousers.

I realise that people have started looking over at me, leant over with my hand full of tissue down the back of my pants, looking strained and ill.

To avoid any confusion on this journey, I thought I'd better clear up with the rest of the bus that my hand was just caught and that I wasn't consciously shaking a hand full of tissues around my arse.

I decide to clear up the matter with this cracker, which wasn't helped by my frustrated cracking voice:

""I'm nOt wIpiNg mY bUM""

This is met with complete silence.

Realising what I've just said, my childish sense of humour kicks in and I start laughing and chuckling - to the point where the streaming nose I had, had emptied itself all over my shirt leaving me looking like a glazed Krispy Kreme donut.

I'm currently typing this from the taxi I've had to take home to get changed, which is going to make me an hour and a half late for work.

I still have to explain this to my boss.

TLDR: got on a bus with a cold, tried to pull tissues out of my back pocket and inadvertently looked like I was caught wiping, and decided to let the bus know that I specifically wasn't wiping my bum. Laughed hard enough to get snot down my shirt, and have had to taxi home to get changed, then will have to explain to my boss why I'm going to be an hour and a half late today.

UPDATE:
Have since arrived at work and explained to the boss what had happened.

My new nickname is smear and everyone is walking round with toilet paper hanging out of the back of their trousers.

Would just like to also point out that the cold has currently consumed every soul in my office, which funnily enough is where I caught it.",tifu
WIBTA if I (37f) tell my husband (38m) that he can follow the event dress code or just stay home?,"My side of the family is very close and ~~my~~ our niece (call her N) is getting married in a few months. The ceremony is halfway across the country and I've been saving for several months so our family of 5 can fly out for it. The venue is upscale and beautiful.

The ceremony will be a formal-ish event (she said it fits most closely with the [""cocktail"" definition here](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet)). 

Husband doesn't *dress up*. He wore a tux for his best friend's wedding when he was 20 and that's the last time he's worn a tie. He wore jeans and a casual sport coat for our wedding (That was fine with me - it was his wedding too and the ceremony was immediate family only).

When I broke the news about N's wedding, adding that we'd rent a suit instead of making an otherwise useless purchase, he said ""No. I'm not wearing a suit. I guess I'll be the only one there not in a suit.""

I told him that if he won't wear the appropriate attire then he can just stay home and everyone will know that he's a whiny butt baby who thinks his personal preference is more important than a special family event for someone he says he loves. I added ""Nice priorities there, honey.""

* My mom and brother (N's dad) said YTA - just ask N if she cares, but they're sure she won't.
* N's mom says I'm NTA, but my delivery could have been better (I disagree - it was perfect for my husband).
* I don't have very many friends to ask, and I'm NOT asking N. Weddings are stressful enough without worrying about inconsiderate guest questions.

What do you think?

Edit: This got bigger than anticipated. And my very first silver and gold! Thank you all! I don't know how I'll get through all your responses, but I'll do my best.

I really don't care that he's jeans, t-shirts and boots. We live in small town in the Midwest. Preachers and undertakers wear suits here.

I just need him to not be so inflexible on something so stupid. You'd think I was asking him to kick puppies or cannibalize small children.

WIBTA if I don't go on a second date with a larger lady because she doesn't match her Tinder pics?,"I'll try to keep this short.

I'm on Tinder and I see a cute chick so I swipe right. In two of her pics it's clear she has a twin. Cool. Not identical, but close enough. They were both above the shoulder shots. We start talking and she's ramping up to be perfect, you know how crushes are yadda yadda.

This last weekend we had our first date. I get there early and wait for her outside and she shows up much larger than in her pics, but she's still cute and I'm not a picky man (plus tmi... dat ass). I figured that the pictures she'd used were from last year and that's fine. Not all my pics are recent either, I just threw up my best. 

The date was actually awesome. The crush is still strong even as I'm typing it but... fuck I was suspicious, alright? That whole twin thing was a weird red? yellow? flag, especially how she talked about her sis. Nothing bad, just... dismissive? Idk how to describe it. Anyways, so I check Facebook and the pictures she had used were from her sister's profile (not fully public but one was her profile pic and another one was visible on there so I'm guessing the rest are hers too). And I'm not sure how to feel now. On one hand, I like her. On the other, she's using her sisters pics to get dates and that's... weird?? But they're twins so she legit would look just like her sis if she lost a bit of weight so it's not really lying??? And I get why she did it, we all got flaws we wanna pretend aren't there, but????

I asked my coworker's their opinion and it's divided as fuck (one lad said I was fat-shaming/lacking empathy), so since I found this sub recently I figured I'd ask here. WIBTA for canceling our second date because her pics don't match?

**UPDATE**

I ended up texting her after work: ""Hey I went to add you on Facebook and your sister's profile popped up. What's going on?"" with a screenshot of her sister's profile (since she had used her sis's profile pic on Tinder.)

Aaaaaand she blocked me. Without explaining anything. So I guess that decides that.

TIFU - By swatting what felt like a fly on my neck.,"Possibly the most traumatizing experience of my entire life just occurred. Maybe you will agree. Maybe this is a ""first world problems"" moment and think that I haven't seen real trauma. I think you will soon realize the latter is not the case and I am lucky to be alive; if the following does not deeply disturb you, you're probably dead emotionally. 

Exactly 15 minutes ago the following occurred. My heart is still beating rather rapidly. It's the time of year where the weather is balmy at night, and we keep our windows open for that light spring breeze.

I was watching Netflix on my computer on one monitor and reading news on other monitor. I feel something crawling on my neck. I quickly swat it with my right hand. Something is NOT right. This is a small creature. This is not a fly. Something is seriously wrong. Something smells terrible. What was that? I turn on the light waking my sleeping wife as I scream like a school girl. My fears are realized. I have narrowly avoided death. I need to move and sell my apartment immediately. I think only holy water and a fire can cleanse my abode. I have washed my hands 6 times. There is a terrible smell on my hand I cannot wash out. I don't understand, I used a napkin. I have dry heaved a dozen times and am barely holding it in. I need someone to suffer in empathy. I have woken my wife. I have shown her the remains of my vanquished foe, she is now equally traumatized. This somehow makes me feel better. We are now afraid to move.

Gillette razors deserve the coming boycot,"In case you have not seen it, they just released a video where they use #metoo to shit all over men. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0

But where is Gillette's outrage when it comes to:

In education girls are leaving boys behind. In nearly all states more girls finish high school than boys. Women are now the majority of university students, and earn the most bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees.

Men are also at a disadvantage after school. Research shows that they get fewer job interviews with the same qualifications as women. For example, if a male meet 40% of the job requirements, he has a 5% chance of getting an interview. Whereas a similarly qualified woman has an 11% chance of getting an interview. 

When it comes to being crushed, mutilated, electrocuted or killed at work, men are at a distinct disadvantage. Most backbreaking, dangerous jobs are done by men. The Labour Department reports that nearly 5,000 American workers die from workplace accidents each year, 90% of these deaths are men. 

Criminal justice: A study by the University of Michigan, found that men receive sentences that are 63% higher, on average, than females for exactly the same crime. Women are also less likely to be arrested, more likely to get a suspended sentence and are released earlier on parole than men. 

What about unwanted pregnancies? Here women have all the choices, while men have zero. A woman can give the baby up for adoption or even have an abortion, without the father's consent. If she decides to keep the baby, the father must pay child support for 18 years, even if he earns very little. A 2007 Urban Institute study on child support, found that 70% of fathers who could not pay, had to pay, on average, 83% of their monthly salary for child support. If a father cannot pay what the court ordered him to pay, he will be send to jail. A 2009 study in South Carolina found that 13.2% of male prisoners were behind bars for non-payment of child support 

In America almost 50% of all marriages end in divorce. More than 70% of these divorces are initiated by the wife, with the main reason given, ""being unhappy in the relationship"".  Not only will men lose half of their property in a divorce, they must also pay alimony and child support to their ex-wives for many years. Men losing their homes in divorce proceedings, is one of the main reasons why nearly 80% of all homeless people in the US are men.

Custody: Divorced women are also more likely to get the children.  In fact, between 68% to 88% of the time they will get custody, depending on the state, mainly because courts view women as ""better"" parents. 

Life expectancy: On average, men die 5 years earlier than women, due to stress and worse life conditions. Yet, women retire earlier than men in most states.  

When we look at all of these factors, is it any wonder that almost 80% of all suicides are committed by men?

But no it is ""men who have to be better"". Fuck YOU Gillette.",unpopularopinion

[NC] My wife will not allow my two young children [6 M and 8 F] to leave Mexico and come home. They have been living in Mexico for the last 2 weeks against my wishes. What can I do?,"So here is the run down.  I'll do my best to keep this as concise as possible.  I am a US citizen, but my wife is not.  We were married 10 years ago, and she was already staying here on an expired visa when we eloped.  Since she was here illegally, she was afraid for us to try to file the green card paperwork on our own due to concerns over possible immediate deportation.  

&#x200B;

We had two children \[6 M and 8 F\] together within two years of marriage.  We've had our ups and downs, and I think that the immigration issue drove a wedge between the two of us.  My wife has some undiagnosed mental issues, and even started practicing witchcraft in our home.  We filed for divorce four years ago, and it was an ugly situation.  She claimed that I abused our children, and fortunately, my step daughter from a prior marriage testified on my behalf.  Despite our issues, we were able to work through things, and we ended up not going through with the divorce.  That being said, when we received the deportation order, my wife, my children, and I were devastated.  I had to take personal time off from work, and my wife was so depressed that she couldn't get out of bed for several weeks.  Regardless, she returned to Mexico this past May to live with her family in Monterrey. 

&#x200B;

When she flew down to Mexico, she traveled with our two children and her daughter \[19 F\] from a previous marriage while I stayed here in the states to work.  The plan was for them to live down in Mexico for a month, learn the language, and get to know her relatives.  At the end of June, her daughter was supposed to come home on a flight with our two children.  When I arrived at the airport to pick them up, only her daughter walked off of the plane.  When I asked where the kids were, she stated that her mother/my wife wouldn't allow them to get on the flight.  I was dumbfounded.  I had no idea what to say, and we drove home in complete silence.  

&#x200B;

When I called her, she claimed that she didn't want to be without her kids, and that she wouldn't voluntarily allow them to come home.  I flew down to Monterrey a few days later and rented a room at a resort so that my wife, the kids, and me could spend some quality time together.  I thought that it would diffuse the situation, and I thought that I could talk her into letting me bring the kids home, under the agreement that we would return to Mexico, as a family, for routine visits.  Unfortunately, she would not agree to this, and I was forced to fly home by myself.    

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do here.  I haven't spoken to an attorney about this yet, and I don't know how the law surrounding this situation works.  Can my wife, a Mexican citizen, hold my kids, legal US citizens (as they were born in the US and have birth certificates), in Mexico against my will?  What is the best course of action for me to take to get my kids back home, assuming that there is something I can do to begin with?",legaladvice
TIFU by joking with a date I was a serial killer.,"So because of circumstances beyond my control this didn't happen today.

Cue my first date with a girl I met on Tinder, we meet up at a restaurant and get to talking. This are going great, she thinks I'm funnier in person (when does that ever happen?!), she actually invites me to the mall to hangout more with some of her friends when dinner is over.

So after the food arrives the conversation turns a little more towards how we met (pay close attention and you will spot my mistake). She states she's glad I'm normal and not some sort of serial killer.

Now I could have just laughed... I could have but I was funny remember? I replied with ""Oh thanks for thinking I'm normal! But I actually am a serial killer, bodies for days buried out at the farm.""

She laughed, I laughed, I thought I did great at making it sound sarcastic.

She excuses herself to the bathroom to do whatever girls do in bathrooms on dates. It was taking a questionably long time for her to return and I was slightly worried she bailed and stuck me with the bill, my luck right? Wrong.

So unbelievably wrong, my luck was worse as police officers suddenly appear out of nowhere and tell me to keep both of my hands visible on the table.

At this point I'm confused, this must be a joke. I see my date coming with a staff member and get ready for Ashton Kutcher to appear, no such luck.

The police ask if it's me and she says ya, the cops get me to stand up and handcuff me and walk me out, not a single person seems to want to answer any of my questions.

I'm in the car and the police are outside talking to my date for a few minutes when they get into the car with me and ask me if I told my date I was a serial killer, areyoufuckingkiddingme...

I tell them yes but I was joking.

LPT: Don't admit to police you told someone you were a serial killer.

So that derailed my plans, I spent the next 5-6 hours explaining myself over and over and over that I was kidding.

I guess eventually they either believed me or got tired of hearing me speak much to my lawyers disapproval (to me speaking) and let me go and reminded me that my jokes suck.

I'm not sure how date number two will go but I'm excited to find out, also a bright side is that I have no idea who paid for my food.

TL:DR: I made a joke I was a serial killer, date doesn't get sarcasm, I spend hours in the police station.",tifu

TIFU by not correcting my cashier when she mistook me for a coworker.,"Today was my first day off work since Friday last week and I decided to run some errands. While I was out I ducked into a grocery store to buy a drink and noticed that the store's EFTPOS was down. The cashier told me that they could still process the sale, I just had to sign for it and the money would be taken out once it came back online. 

On my drive home I realised that I had forgotten to pick up stuff for dinner so I swung into the grocery store closest to my place, which happened to be the same brand as the one earlier. I got my stuff with no problem and went to line up at the conveyer belt and this was where my fuckup began. 

I'm a person with anxiety so I always prepare something to say when I'm inevitably asked how my day is going. I knew that I was going to respond with ""good, it's been pretty busy although I had a sleep in this morning since I was at work so late last night"". I got up to the cashier and said hello, she looked at me in surprise and went ""oh, are you not working today?"" and I just panicked. This wasn't what I had prepared for. So my stupid brain decided to go with what I had already prepared and I said ""nah I was working late last night so I'm not in today.""

The second it came out of my mouth I wanted to hit myself. Why didn't I just say that I didn't work there? Sure I could correct her now, but I'm already in too deep. 

So we start talking about work. She complains about having a three hour shift and how it only works out as two and a half hours pay. For some reason I say that I'm lucky that I'm not working since it looks like it's a busy day. She asks me if I've heard anything about Shaun leaving. I said that I heard he is. She was upset about that, he's a nice guy. I agreed, he's one of the good ones. I have no fucking clue who Shaun is. 

I manage to lie my way through the conversation, mentally berating myself but also congratulating myself on my tremendous acting skills. We get to the point where I'm about to pay and what do you know, the EFTPOS is down.  Part of my coping for anxiety is trying to make others as comfortable and happy as possible so instead of having her freak out over the system going down, I simply explain to her how to process the sale. Information I only know because I was at the other store two hours ago! 

She looks at me and goes, ""well at least someone who works here knows what they're doing."" I laugh nervously. Yeah...right. 

Then she asks me for my staff card to scan for ""my"" staff discount. And of course I don't have a goddamned card. Who do you think I am, an employee? Luckily since I had only shoved my credit card into my phone case instead of bringing my whole purse I managed to come up with a lie about how I didn't have my full purse so I don't have my card. That's alright though, she can put it through on hers and I can sign it. 

I signed a name that definitely wasn't mine. Is that illegal? Probably not. I then picked up my bags and ran. Didn't even say bye. I needed out of there. 

As I hurried away, I heard the guy on the register behind her turn around and go, ""did you know her?""

I don't think I can ever go back there. Either I'd have to attempt to keep up the pretence or go back and own up to it and face the shame. So I think I'll take option three and avoid my neighbourhood grocery store like the plague. 

TL;DR: Cashier at my local grocery store mistook me for a coworker. Instead of correcting her my anxiety ridden brain decided to play along. I got in deep enough that I was teaching her to process sales. After she gave me her staff discount I fled the store and now don't ever want to show my face again.

Edit: wow thanks for the silver! And because a few people have asked, yes I am in therapy. I have been on and off for almost ten years. I suffered from abuse for the majority of my life and while 99% of the time I'm perfectly functioning I do still have a compulsive need for people to like me because that it something I deem safe. Hence my inability to rock the boat by telling her that she thinks I'm someone I'm not. That could end in an unsafe situation and in those moments it's not a risk I'm willing to take.

Edit two: and some golds! Damn if I knew you guys enjoyed anxiety fueled fuckups then I'd have been sharing my dumb stories ages ago.",tifu

TIFU by chilling at my friend's place while she wasn't home,"My friend Jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and I finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  I ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

I made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  Dude was intimidating and I'm a 4'11"" woman so I was immediately scared.  He looked shocked to see me.  I'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that I surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

I panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  I'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  I start screaming at HIM to get the fuck out and that I'm calling the police (total bluff because I didn't have my phone.)  He then yells back that HE is calling the police on ME.  This gives me pause.  At this point, I look around and realize the bedroom I'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  I ask him through the door if he knows Jenna (last name).  He tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  WELL.  Apparently, Jenna's neighbor ALSO keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

So, today I fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  

TL;DR Today I fucked up by wasting a sandwich.",tifu
I find it uncomfortable when white people say they hate white people,"I'm not sure if they use this form of self-racism/deprecation as a way to make up for racist white people, but it's honestly disturbing to hear them basically rejecting their own ethnic group. As a black person I have experienced a lot of self-racists in my own community and I wouldn't want that for anyone. No idea when this started, but I feel like this is very toxic behavior that benefits no one.

AITA for wanting him to keep his furry in check?,"Hi everyone.

My boyfriend broke up with me and told me its because I'm a horrible person for not accepting him. He's on reddit more than me (first time posting, hi) so he will definitely see this.

To keep the story very short: I met him a year ago - he was my first real boyfriend (I'm f/late 20s) and told me around our 5th date that he had recently started becoming a furry. Wasn't a dealbreaker for me and I really liked him, so we continued dating.

He started getting more deeply into it, bought two really scary fursuits for 5400€ (glow-in-the-dark eyes, jesus), asked me to have sex in the suits. Again, I accepted. Personally, I'm not into this whole thing at all but he was and I liked him, so it was all okay on my front.

Around our 6-month anniversary, he started to wear the fursuit pretty much all the time apart from work. That started annoying me because it was summer and super hot and more often than not I would end up having to sleep on the sofa because it got so hot in his bed. He got really upset about it and told me he needed me to buy a fursuit as well so we could be 'mates'. I declined (honestly, at that point it was mostly because I didn't have the money - I probably would have done it for him if he'd pestered my long enough).

Our relationship got worse but then my friend from back home asked me and a whole bunch of friends to dinner since she'd recently had a baby. BF was obviously invited.

He wanted to go in the fursuit and I told him no. He told me I needed to accept him and not be ashamed of him and I told him that we had agreed he could do whatever he wanted in his or my apartment but not during meetings with my family and friends because most of them wouldn't get it and I especially didn't want to have to explain to my grannie and older relatives.

He accused me of not accepting him, of being an intolerant and racist 'cunt', for not accomodating him and getting a fursuit on my own etcetc. and then broke up with me. He's been guilt-tripping me on social media and amonst our friends ever since and has made me feel horrible bc of this. The first few months afterwards I was honestly really freaking broken up about it and it's only been recently that I've been getting angry instead.

EDIT: I'm very overwhelmed by the responses, thank you to everyone who had something nice to say and made me feel better about the situation. Many of the comments gave me a lot to think about and I'm glad to know that people don't think I was acting horribly. Thanks again :)

EDIT2: An acquaintence let me know that he read this and isn't happy.

TIFU by sleeping in a loft.,"This literally happened last night.  TLDR at the bottom. 

So my husband and I are celebrating our one year anniversary with a ""minimoon"" since we didn't take a honeymoon when we got married. 

We decided to go to a romantic touristy island near Canada for the weekend and do sightseeing and eat all the fudge we can before getting diabetes (some of you can probably guess where we're at by now). 

Now, staying on the island itself is crazy expensive, so I found us a cute little Air B&B ""tiny house"" style [cabin](https://i.imgur.com/JvUpf4c.jpg) to stay in instead. It's cute, has a sauna, fire pit, and a loft bed area.  

The drive up was long and uneventful. When we got to the cabin we decided to find a fun place to eat and have a few local beers before turning in. This was my first mistake. 

I ended up drinking four hard ciders of unknown alcohol content and getting a pretty good buzz. 

We decide when we get back to the cabin to just go straight to bed, so we crawl up there and pass out. I slept on the side closest to the tv, farthest from the stairs. This was my second mistake. 

At some point I have to pee. Bad. So I start to get down from the loft. 

But I wasn't fully awake. 

And I didn't take the stairs. 

Dear readers, I decided in my half asleep state to climb over the railing (by the tv) because I thought the stairs were there. I come to full consciousness when I crash to the floor HARD. 

I screamed for my dear husband to save me since I didn't know the damage and still had to pee. He flew down the stairs and helped me get to the bathroom and set me up on the couch for the rest of the night because I was too scared to be up in the loft again. 

Luckily I didn't break anything (on myself or the cabin) or hit my head, but my hip took the brunt of the fall and we have a full day of sightseeing today. And a seven hour car ride home tomorrow. 

TL;DR: Yeeted myself out of a loft because I forgot where the stairs were.",tifu
My MIL tampered with my birth control resulting in me getting pregnant 3mo postpartum. Not really sure what to do from here.,"Let me just start out by saying if you know who I am, please don't say anything. I created a throwaway to vent and cry and get support as anonymously as possible. I'm still very happy about the pregnancy, or at least want to be. I just need support. Thanks for understanding. 

My husband (22m) and I (20f) welcomed our daughter into the world 18 weeks ago. She's a darling baby and really pretty easy as far as new borns go, except for one: she wasn't a son. My ILs were obsessed with the idea of us having a son, to the point that they denied she was a girl up until the moment she was born. Why? Because, ""the bloodline follows the father. If you don't have a son, our family name will die out, because your daughter will marry a man and carry on *his* bloodline. So girls don't really count."" The day they came to visit in the hospital, my ILs asked when we would be trying for another baby. We kind of just laughed it off, but my MIL got more insistent, straight up telling us ""y'all need to try for a boy!"" 

Over the next month or two the conversation about us having another baby sort of tapers off into little comments every now and again. I had no problem ignoring them, and we'd already told them it wasn't happening so I just let it run off my back. Around this time, MIL started coming over daily for a few hours, watching the baby for me so that I could sleep and also occasionally clean up a bit for me. She'd be over unsupervised anywhere from 1 - 4hrs. 

Fast forward to present day. Two days ago now, my husband poured me a mixed drink, and when I brought the cup up to my lips, I got hit with this paranoid and panicked feeling. I immediately put the cup down and insisted we take a pregnancy test. Sure enough, it comes back positive. We wait until the next morning, take a digital test and again, positive. Based on LMP I should have been about 6 weeks along. After getting over the initial shock, we were excited but confused. For several reasons, we hadn't been able to get hormonal birth control, so we'd been using condoms and lube to make sure they didn't tear. So we weren't sure how we'd gotten pregnant, but we're happy with the news. We decided we wouldn't tell anyone because we didn't want another baby stampede from his family, but I'm incredibly close with my SIL so I decided to tell her after swearing her to secrecy. 

When I told her, her yes got wide and started to water and she asked if I was serious, and was I sure. I told her I know my husband and I are young, but between us we make more than enough to support another baby. SIL bursts into tears and starts to apologize over and over, meanwhile I sit there with my mouth hanging open and lost. She calms down a bit, and through her tears tell me that *my MIL has been poking holes in our condoms pretty much since we came home from the hospital*. She claims MIL told her she did it, but she thought that she was just spouting shit because she was upset we didn't have a boy. And suddenly everything clicked into place. That's why the condoms didn't work even though we were careful with them. That's why she'd always shoo me off to sleep while she was around. And that's what she was doing when she was ""cleaning"" my house - snooping for our condoms. And she knew I wasn't on birth control because I remember complaining to her about how my OB went on maternity leave and I wasn't able to find another one that took my insurance at the time. 

I'm so angry I don't know what to do. I want to go right over to her house and tear her a new one so bad I can smell my tires burning in the blacktop. I'm also illogically angry at SIL for not telling me - how could you think this was a joke when she was so specific about everything she was going to do?! Why didn't you warn me? I would have put my condoms in my room. I'm livid with MIL. I'm pleased with this pregnancy but it wasn't my choice. It wasn't even an accident, it was her meddling because she didn't get the Golden Grandson she wanted. I don't even know how to handle this. I want to scorch the earth but I also still don't want his family knowing I'm pregnant. And I'm not even 12 weeks yet so the risk of a miscarriage is still uncomfortably high. The only bright side of this whole thing is it's snatched my husband out of his mothers FOG so violently he's probably got whiplash. Personally, my pregnancy has soured a bit so I'm really trying to hang on to any happiness I have about the pregnancy left. If you have Irish Twins of your own or are one, I'd love some positive feedback on that situation. 

Where do we go from here?

ETA Update:

First, let me clarify: I am 20yrs old, not eighteen. I'm 18 weeks postpartum, not 12. 12 is when I would have conceived given that I'm 6 weeks along based on LMP. Second, I don't give a shit if you think this is fake, I honestly wish that it were. If you don't have advice to give I kindly ask that you take your judgement elsewhere. 

Now that that's out the way, here's the update:

I want to thank you all for your support and suggestions. Having a plan makes me feel way less panicked and overwhelmed. Sadly, what MIL did isn't a crime here, so there won't be any jail time of charges pressed. For now, game plan is NC with MIL for me, babe, or growing babe once the truth is out. Before then, I want all the proof in the world she did this. I've ordered a hidden camera, and am going to buy new, latex free condoms claiming that I'm suddenly allergic to latex. Hopefully she'll poke holes again and I'll have video proof this time. Even if I can't use it to press charges, I want all the proof I have that she's not safe to be around so she can't sue for GPR if this baby *is* a boy. I also have decided to change our family last name to literally anything else bc I'm a petty bitch and since she wants to act an ass over this stupid name, then nobody gets it. As for my husband, he's willing and ready to do whatever I decide. Currently he's asleep, so we'll be discussing everything at breakfast. Thanks again everyone.",relationship_advice
TIFU accidentally watching a Black Mirror Episode with Audio Description on,"Not today, but Black Mirror subpost about season 3 being the best was trending yestersay, and I just remembered my fuck up. 

Said episode was ""Shut up and Dance"", where the young protagonist was forced to rob a bank, fight other people, etc. Because an unknown person hacked into his computer and threatened to reveal his dark secrets if not complied. 

Now, I don't understand how, but for some reason, the audio description was turned on when the episode began. So the narrator describes the characters' actions inbetween dialogues like, ""Sister comes up and touches his hands"" and whatnot. 

Had it been any other shows or movies, my wife and I definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. But of course, the Black Mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. 

I think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don't really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. We were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. 

Well, the end was near, and came the twist. Normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. We were like yeah, yeah, that's cool, so what was the voice? And to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.

We were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as Black Mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn't grasp anything. After some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.  

Tl;dr turned on audio description, thought it was part of the show and got really confused.





Edit: mostly lurker, I don't know if there are any etiquettes I have to follow through, I will upvote everyone's comments for now.

For those who says it's not TIFU, I guess it's mundane, that's true. Since some folks are okay with the change of intensity? Of fuck up, and so are mods,  I am at peace with it.",tifu

My gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn't like where I proposed.,"I decided to propose to my gf of three years on our three year anniversary. I flew her to Vietnam and after a couple of weeks traveling we ended up in Cambodia. She had wanted to see Angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. After a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together I proposed and she said yes. We kissed and I had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. It's really beautiful. She took a shower and I laid in bed thinking what an amazing day I just had and how I would get to spend the rest of my life with the women I loved. When she came out of the shower however she was in tears. She handed me back the ring saying she couldn't accept it because she didn't want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

I played it cool and said I understood but truthfully it hurt. It seems to me that I had offered her something of value. A lifelong commitment and partner. I took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. I felt that if she valued me it wouldn't matter that the proposal wasn't exactly what she wanted. It was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. If she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn't throw it back because of where it came from. So she can't possibly value me or what I have to offer as an individual if she's willing to reject it because she didn't like the place I asked. 

I'm preparing to end things when we get back. She wants me to propose again and better and then she'll say yes, but I'm done. Am I wrong? Should I do it over? What do you think.

Any advice is appreciated.",relationship_advice
AITA for blasting my horn at a person using their phone whilst driving?,"This happened about 30 minutes ago. 

I was driving home with a friend. We were coming up to a roundabout that was clear from my side. As I was passing over, a woman came speeding past from the left, causing me to have to slow down substantially in the middle of the roundabout. 

She was on her phone, holding it by her head with her elbow resting on the open window, speaking into it. I blasted my horn at her, a slight bit of road rage sure, but this startled her and caused her to drop her phone out the car window. 

I don't know what happened after that, but it's a busy roundabout so I doubt she was able to retrieve it before it was smashed into a million pieces. The person I was driving with blasted me, saying I shouldn't have done that and I was an asshole for causing the destruction of what was presumably an expensive phone. I disagree, play stupid games win stupid prizes and all that. But, my friend is insistent that I was an asshole. 

AITA?

EDIT: women to woman.

EDIT: okay holy shit this blew up. I can't read through all the comments, so I'll just try clear up a couple things. 

1) This is in England, we give way to the right and not the left. The roundabout was a 2 lane on a busy street, no pedestrian access. 

2) For those saying obviously NTA, karma whoring etc - I get it. If I could lock this post now I would. However, there's been quite a few ESH's and YTA's with good points, and I'm now thinking whilst NTA feels good, and there is a sense of instant karma, ESH is probably more appropriate. I shouldn't have blazed my horn, it wasn't really an emergency, and in doing so I could've caused a worse accident.

The hatred of police on reddit is disgusting.,"I see so many people on this site who comment ACAP or ACAB on all cop posts. These comments are almost always highly upvoted even though it is completely wrong. There is literally a 0% chance every cop in the U.S. are racist, dog killing bastards like so many people on reddit think they are. I would bet my life that not even 0.5% of cops are like that. I saw a picture on the front page of a cop grieving the loss of his K9 partner. Many of the highly upvoted comments were saying that they have no sympathy for the man because they believe that all cops are dog killers. Most of the comments arguing with them had many downvotes. The vast majority of cops are good people trying to serve while risking their lives everyday. It is absolutely idiotic to actually hate all cops because of a few stories you see on the news sometimes. It's like thinking all teachers are pedophiles since a few have been caught sleeping with their students.




Edit: I didn't make this clear in my post but I'm defending cops as individuals and not the police force as a whole. I wanted to make this post because of the comments on the post of the picture of the cop grieving the life of his k9 partner. Many highly upvoted comments said things like they have no sympathy for the man and that he deserves to suffer just because of the fact that he is a cop. I do agree with the people who say there are things wrong with the police force as a whole but I fully disagree with the people who believe that all cops are racist or dog killers or just assholes.

"Me (36M) found out my wife (34F) has been cheating on me, don't know what to do","TL:DR: Wife slept with a married guy, kept talking to him afterwards, was also at the same time having an emotional and sexual relationship online with two foreign guys. We have 3 kids and a bad financial situation. Divorce is not an easy option and we both want to try to salvage the marriage but I don't know if I can.

  
Let me start with some backstory. We've been together for almost 17 years, have 3 kids an old house we've been slowly restoring over the last 2 years and our budget is not the greatest, no savings and lots of debt.

She's the only woman I've ever been with and before me, she had only a couple of one-night stands, so we were both little experienced when we met. She's been the light of my life and we've gone through some difficult times together and always have we been there for another. I thought we were one of the few who managed to stay on course no matter what. Apparently I was wrong.

With all that was going on, trying to fix the house, both working full time, trying to make ends meet and to make sure the kids are doing fine, we kinda lost ourselves. The bad financial situation and health related issues didn't help either. My wife had been trying to lose weight for a long time but nothing seemed to work for her and her self esteem was down to the floor. We were both depressed, but instead of talking and consoling one another, we suffered in silence. I buried my nose in computer games to hide from our problems while she had her nose in her phone all the time. This spring and summer, things started going worse. She was spending more time with her friends and going partying, while I stayed at home with the kids. I thought that if I let her „blow off some steam"" that she would come home in a better mood, but that didn't work at all.

I tried to ignore the bad feeling that was starting to sink in my stomach. I had heard a rumor that she had been seen kissing some dude at a dance in a nearby town. I confronted her about it, but she denied and said that the guy had tried to kiss her, but she pushed him away. I was not fully convinced, but didn't want to push her too much as I was trying to let her see that I trusted her. Yet as the summer passed, I noticed she was getting way more protective and secretive about her phone. After seing by chance what her FB password was one night in august 22nd, I decided to taka a look, to see if I could find anything about that dance earlier that summer. What I found was way worse.

I saw that indeed she had been kissing some dude drunk as hell until her friend pulled her out of it, but that's nothing compared to what I saw next. I accessed her Messenger and Skype.

I found out that she had been chatting online with two foreign guys, A and B, for months. It had started on Instagram, some random dude, A, sent her some flattering messages and she started talking to him on Skype after that in early June. After only speaking to him for less than two weeks she started sharing with him nude photos after only resisting a bit. The incident with the guy she kissed happened later that month. She was chatting with this guy A up until midst of August, when he showed his real intention, he was a scammer with a stolen account and was just sending her pictures from that stolen profile. Yet she had been fooled enough to share with him pictures of her most intimate parts. She seemed like she was falling in love with him. By then she was already started to talk to guy B, which also started on Instagram. Didn't take long for that to evolve to nude pictures and sexual talk. In both cases they were fantasizing about them coming to our country and meet with my wife at a hotel. She never spoke ill of me or anything like that, just talked about me like I was just there. If they asked, she said that I treated her well, but then she went on to tell them how she like to talk to them and they made her feel good. The worst is yet to come.

In one of the chats with a female friend of hers I found some more disturbing things. They went together to a 2 day town festival in another nearby town in early july, stayed at a rented room, which I of course had agreed to and thought would be ok, and I knew that my wife's friend who has trouble with panic attacks had needed to stay overnight at the local hospital. But what I didn't know and saw in that chat between them was that she mentioned a 41 year old guy from our own town (guy C), a married man with kids, who was unhappy in his relationship and she had met him that night. He had come over to chat and had tried to „go all the way"" but my wife told her friend that she had stopped him. She didn't mention the name, but I found out a likely suspect as our town is small and I also found in my online phone records that she had sent a message to a number belonging to a guy that fit the description. I feared the worst.

I didn't let my wife know what I had found yet, as I was afraid what would happen while the kids were around, so I put up a mask and waited until saturday 24th of august to confront my wife. I had called my mother and got her to take care of the kids. My wife is taking some classes to get some form of degree for her work and when she came home from class I asked her calmly to sit with me and I told her about what I knew. There was no violence, yelling or bad mouthing. Just two sad people, one of them angry and hurt, and we talked the whole night. She promised that nothing had happened between her and „C"" and what she had done online was only to try boosting her self esteem a bit as she thought I had stopped loving her. She didn't exactly try to blame me for it, nor did she yell at me for snooping around. She said she thought I didn't like her anymore because she wasn't losing weight and when those guys started raining compliments on her she said she got addicted. She said she didn't mean to hurt me, she was selfish and tried to please them as she could so they would keep complimenting her, therefore sending them nude pictures. She told me that she saw it now that she had been cheating on me but she hadn't realised it while she was doing it, even though she knew she was doing something wrong.

I wanted to believe her, I truly did. But I had concerns. We decided to try to fix our marriage and seek counseling. As the weeks passed, things seemed to be getting better. She's been way more affectionate to me and caring. Our sex life has been great and we've been spending way more time together than before. I still had a growing feeling in my stomach that she was hiding some critical information from me and after our second meeting with the marriage counselor last week, she finally admitted the truth. She admitted what I had suspected and feared but deeply hoped hadn't happened. She had indeed slept with C that night in july. And even though she said she had felt bad afterwards and shameful, she still kept talking to him via social media. She admitted to have met with him twice after that, but nothing more than a bit of kissing. She even tried to contact him again a few days after I had confronted her in august.

My first response after that was simply freezing. I didn't yell or curse or anything. I din't harm her in anyway. I partly felt relieved that she had finally admitted what I suspected, but at the same time I felt humiliated and hurt beyond anything I've ever felt before. I didn't want to rush to anything so I haven't thrown the ring in her face yet, nor have I confronted the other guy, as I don't want to be the person to rat on him to his wife or make myself get arrested for assault. Besides, it wasn't him that broke my marriage contract, it was my wife.

I don't know what to believe anymore. The woman I thought I knew would never do something like this. She's been trying to convince me that she was an idiot and selfish and whatnot and that she feels really bad about hurting me like that. She says she's ready to do anything to fix the situation and to get me to trust her again and feel like she's worthy again. 

Honestly I don't know if I'll ever trust her again or see her with the same eyes. I do love her of course and I like to be around her, and see her smile. But at the same time it stings my heart. I want this to work because of the kids and our shitty financial situation, as we can't afford going through divorce, but I fear that I will lose myself and never gain any self respect if I go through with this.

How the hell can I forgive her for cheating on me with not only one guy but three? Well, four, if you count that one time she kissed a random guy. She was both emotionally as well as physically cheating with all of them for some period of time. Not just a one drunk night mistake, but some kind of emotional and sexual relationship with three guys for over 2 months. Doesn't matter if two of those relationships were online. She still planned to meet with them, knowing fully what would happen if they did.

Has anyone here gone through anything similar to this and has some good advice? I know it's easy to say: „just divorce her man and move on"", but it's not that simple. I still have feelings for her and I don't know what will happen with our kids and our families. I also fear that if I dicorce her, which will mean that her family and friends will know the truth, that she will harm herself or at least be in a mental state where she will have bad influence on our kids. We also have an unfinished house and no savings and need at least to finish fixing it in order to get any cash out of selling it.",relationship_advice

UPDATE-AITA for kicking a girl off our airsoft team for not following our rules. Update is we had our meeting and I sincerely took feedback from r/AITA into meeting.,"I got permission from the moderators to update and I wanted to share what happened. 

Here is the original if you didn't see it yesterday:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/apiwrd/aita_for_kicking_a_girl_off_my_airsoft_team/


Since people had things tonight we agreed to meet over lunch and all but 3 people agreed to show up, even among the people that quit outright. So including me 16. I got to the office where we had it and was so surprised to see Madison sitting there. So that made it 17 people. The guy who has been on the team the longest  basically said that in light of what happened Sunday, he would do the talking. This really annoyed me but i remembered how much bad feedback I got here and didn't say anything. 

They started off by having Madison say her thing. I have to admit she was very rational and but she did start crying which made me really uncomfortable. But basically her point was she just moved her for grad school, she didn't want to do the bar and club scene anymore and she said the loved all of us for never asking her out or making her feel uncomfortable and it was the first time she felt like she ever found a group of people, including her sorority, where people didn't judge her for her looks. I was like sure, whatever you think but come on. Anyways she said she was really sorry for not keeping our standards and she was just trying to have fun and she is a girl and doing crazy things with her hair or wearing pink camo is just in her mind set. She asked me if I would please consider if I she could stay on the team. 

I was totally on the spot so I was just started out by saying that I was sorry and I overreacted. But then I said I think it's best if I step down because it was obvious I take it too seriously and if 5 people quit in the spot, obviously it was time for a change. But as long as I was still doing it, I was happy to have her back. 

So that lifted a huge weight in the room. So we got into more business and it turns out that the reason Madison had not bought her competition gear is because she was reaching out to various companies using her ""insta-fame"" to get our team sponsored. She said the reason she didn't tell me anything because these deals are very tenuous and she didn't want to let us down if they fell through. So she's still working on the uniform stuff but she did get an incredible deal to become a representative for an ammo company so starting with the tournament in March we will have absolutely free airsoft pellets, which for a team of 20 people who play mostly every weekend is huge. She is starting an airsoft specific Instagram and she expects it will take off and she'll get deals for the team. I'm literally blown away by her generosity and I'm sure she'll make some income from it, but she's choosing to share with us after the way I treated her. 

But anyways so we talked about more team business and we decided that we would sort of split the leadership position in that we would have an adminstrator for day to day stuff and that's going to be the guy who started the meeting but everyone was happy with how I managed the team for tournaments so I'll be in charge of all tournament related business and conduct at tournaments.  We also agreed that we would dramatically loosen the uniform requirements for weekend local play and Madison (or anyone I guess) could wear her pink camo or do her hair in bright red pony tail puffs as long as she was being safe (no belly shirts) but tournaments we would still have our team unforms.

So that is where we are. Team is still together, we get a bunch of free stuff and maybe more on the way. Madison is cool but it was the first time a teammate hugged me after a meeting but I guess we have to adjust to hugging and crying at our meetings. It's weird but i guess I can stand to update my world view. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for denying my terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother?,"I don't want a baby. I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.

When she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. 

This woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. 

That said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. 

My father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.

 I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? 

I just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. 

As you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.

UPDATE: first of all i'd like to apologise, I mislead you, my SO and I are recently engaged, not yet married. I said, wife, because i realise that a very large section of the people who read this would tell me to leave the relationship because being in the same headspace is essential for marriage. if she leaves me because she wants a family then i understand, but it's not an option I'm considering. 

I love her massively, I don't think she is interested in heading back onto the dating scene, and oxygen tanks can put some guys off. I've promised her i will look after her and I'm not going back on that. - im really sorry about that guys, i was trying to narrow down the advice to just yes or no rather than reading through loads of comments telling me to GTFO, but i accidentally made some people question if this was real - and by extension question their faith in humanity.... 

Secondly, when my SO and i met shortly before she was diagnosed and told that a baby was off the table, so we headed towards our future assuming that we were on the same page. 

thirdly, many people are asking what her illness is, i wasn't going to say because i was worried she would find the post and get upset. but because this thread is becoming so popular i think its a good opportunity to raise awareness about a very rare illness called pulmonary hypertension. you can read about it here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/causes/

finally I would like to thank all of you. Almost without acception, you have been incredibly kind and supportive. some of you think I should have the baby, some of you think its a terrible idea, but all of you are being honest, supportive and kind. ",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling people my sister had an abortion.,"I'm 99% sure I'm a megga asshole but I came here to just be sure. 

my sister 23f is a megga pro life advocate, here is the stupid part, I held her hand a year ago when she got her abortion. she never mentions it and I can guarantee that I'm the only one who knew. 

I always feel like she is being super hypocritical because she got an easy access to have an abortion and then wants to take that away from others. 

I was getting sick of seeing her abortion kills babys posts and how she hates pro choice people so I decided to comment on one of her posts. I commented, you where definitely pro life when I held your had last year at the abortion clinic. 

I've now been blocked and she was banned from most of her pro life fb groups.

TIFU (shoulda just left my neighbor alone),"im keeping names besides mine out of this for privacy. i step outside to smoke a cigarette on my front porch roughly 2 hours ago and as im trying to get my lighter to work i hear crying first off my front porch to my house is enclosed by white gate wall with little holes same for the door so nobody can even see through from the outside, however i can see through from the inside ( it's nice to be able to catch scumbags trying to break into my car in the middle of the night because of this) anyway, i look for the crying it didnt sound like a child it sounded like a full grown woman. i quickly find out who is crying directly across the street from my house to the right 1 house i see my neighbor's significant other on her knees crying like she was. A. beaten up, or B. devastated from something such as a breakup. i heard yelling and stuff breaking last night. i assumed the latter. so i wanted to check if she was at the very least unharmed. i usually keep my nose out of peoples business but the inner captain save a hoe in me kicked in for some reason TBH i try to look out for my neighbors regardless my reasoning behind it is because you live next to them so you may as well be social once or twice just to know if things are going to be chill.

i walk across the street and introduce myself i have not spoken to these people before because they are never home until almost midnight and they leave around 6 a.m. damn near everyday they were very quiet and not nosy in anyway so i never attempted to talk to them when a opportunity to do so in the past arose. i say ""hi im taylor, i apologize for the intrusion i just want to make sure you aren't harmed."" clearly very upset she hardly could speak clearly and started to try to say ""he doesn't want to be with me anymore"" im relieved to know she is fine physically so im ready to say ""best of luck"" and head home. not even 5 seconds pass and the front door opens swiftly and its the neighbor he starts yelling is this the motherfucker you're seeing?.. how did he come to that conclusion? ( if i recognized his face sort of why cant he? ) i try to immediately say ""im your neighbor i was just trying to make sure she was unharmed."" then the woman FUCKS ME OVER dragging me into the drama further she yells "" yeah, this is taylor and hes way better than you in everyway!"" my face turns red out of anger my eyes wide open and mouth agape, why the fuck would you say that? the dude likely interpreted that as why did you just tell him the truth im sure thats how he interpreted it because just as i finish saying WTF to this woman I GET PUNCHED SO FUCKING HARD, i should have seen it coming he was visibly very angry. 

&#x200B;

( now I've done time in prison so i am no stranger to fighting the only reason i mention this is because i want to shed a little perspective on my lifestyle and the reasoning behind my following decision to take matters into my own hands. i do not call cops, i do not ever run from a fight. i never ever ever stick my nose into other peoples business and i broke that rule over a woman crying.)

&#x200B;

i am on someone elses property i get hit. well i have cameras outside my house and i know that his house is within full view so i could have just called the cops and been done with it but no this is something i considered not one bit. i unloaded on this guy he was the same size and build however i was probably in better shape than him aside from my lungs. this woman that made things worse is now full blown hysterical she wailing and crying louder and harder than before and i just beat up my neighbor he beat me up too but this wasn't my first rodeo and this guy was a suit and tie. soft hands no calluses he absolutely made good choices in life and is more successful than me financially but he made a huge mistake as well as i. the noise from this other woman drew the attention of other neighbors now i know most of the immediate surrounding ones except 2 and guess which neighbors came to investigate?take a wild fucking guess? the neighbors i dont know and they are on the phone. (FUCK..........MY...........LIFE) i decided ill go home and pull up the recording so if the police show up i have some sort of defense. i have a record and things look bad im expecting to go to jail for trespassing, assault you name it.

10 minutes later a patrol car arrived and a cop bangs on my door i have the recording on my phone so all i have to do is hand the phone to our officer and let fate decide. i gave my statement in cuffs and im in the back of the car for almost 45 minutes im thinking this is it im screwed. then the magic happened a second patrols car shows up and both officers start talking and watch the video i asked them to look at i know the first officer already saw the video almost right away so im thinking yes they believe me and dude is gonna get his. sure enough they place him in the car and the officer comes over opens the door for me and says step out  unlocks the cuffs and said im not under arrest and that my video saved my ass then they cuff the woman and throw er in the car i was in i asked why she was getting arrested she wasnt in the fight directly. and then i heard the scummiest most absolute piece of garbage thing ever. they both, the couple, tried to say i attacked the dude threatened the woman and i was trying to threaten them from calling the police WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK. an hour ago they were against each other to the point where the woman was getting kicked out of the house. and they actually tried to get me thrown in jail. now the officer said that it looked like what they were saying was true or close to the truth when they watched the video but the audio is what made sure i was innocent they where able to hear part of  the conversation because of their yelling. NEVER AGAIN, NEVER WILL I ENTER DRAMA AND IF MY NEIGHBOR IS SEEN AGAIN I WILL ENJOY SCARING HIM WITH INTIMIDATING LOOKS.

&#x200B;

TLDR - I saw a female neighbor that i didnt know at all crying. went to see if things were fine and it turned into getting puched, almost arrested with accusations of assault and threats",tifu

Cop Pulls Wife Over (AGAIN),"Previous Story: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9xn1ni/a\_cop\_pulled\_over\_wife\_and\_gave\_her\_3\_tickets\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9xn1ni/a_cop_pulled_over_wife_and_gave_her_3_tickets_and/)

This isn't an update. Yesterday the cop that pulled my wife over a few months ago pulled her over again yesterday. We have paid all of the tickets that were given to her and got her license squared away. The problem I have is that my wife wasn't speeding, was wearing her seatbelt, was driving her sister's car and the officer pulled her over again. When he got to the window he called my wife by her last name and asked, ""Did you get your tickets and license taken care of?"" and then proceeded to run her information. Since everything was good to go he let her go. I have a couple of concerns about this and you guys were so helpful last time. We are in Austin, TX (Williamson County)

&#x200B;

1. Is this even a legal stop? Can a cop pull over someone to check their ticket/license status and not for any other reason?
2. My wife was driving her sister's car so the cop didn't recognize the car, he recognized her and even called her by her last name. This seems extremely creepy and weird and I don't know if its acceptable behavior for a police officer.
3. Should we be worried about him pulling her over in the future and at what point is it considered harassment?
4. What should our next steps be?

Update: Thanks everyone for answering the questions. I appreciate the differences of opinions. That is one of the reasons I posted on here. I understand that he is doing his job and that may require different things. I will be getting a dash cam as soon as possible and will keep things recorded to ensure her safety.

For those that disagree that it was creepy. I found it creepy and/or weird because he called her by her name before he had asked for her information. The license plate is registered to her sister who is married which is a completely different last name and everything.",legaladvice

I stupidly got drunk. I usually know my tolerance level but I'm on anti depressants so I think it messed with me in the end. I just remember being put on a bed at my friends house and my guy friend spooning me. Next thing i know he's in me and covering my mouth. Also forced me to give him deep throat and I almost threw up on him. I know I was moaning like I was enjoying it but I remember thinking it was my boyfriend half the time because I so drunk out of my mind. I don't know what to do. I feel so disappointed in everything that had happened and that I was so dumb to let it happen to me. I haven't talked to my ""friend"" since. I don't think I want to see him anymore after that. 

Should I tell him? What should I do? I feel like shit physically and emotionally. 

Update: it's been a minute but after typing it all out I feel much differently. It feels like I woke up from a horrifying nightmare. I'm 19 I'm too young to be dealing with bullshit. I feel like I fucked up big time. Nothing about the situation feels normal but at the same time it feels like a recurring theme in my life. I've grown up being sexually abused by a family member who is currently in the process of being convicted for child pornography. It just doesn't seem fair. Last night all I wanted was to have fun with my friends before the semester started. And to everyone who had to read through everything, I'm sorry. I want to say sorry to my parents and my boyfriend and my friends and to God. It's ironic because yesterday I told my parents I wanted to go to church again but this morning I couldn't bring myself to face my sins. My plan for now is to try and get as much of my shit together. The semester starts tomorrow and I feel like my world has been flipped upside down. I've missed taking my meds yesterday and I have already been a day behind for a week. I can feel myself falling again. I'm trying guys, I really am. Whoever is reading this, I'm trying. 

[WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT IN DETAIL - VERY NSFW]

Four friends including me, I am the youngest(19f everyone else is 20+), another girl (lesbian), and two guys had a bonfire for one last get together before the semester begins. It was also a reunion since we haven't all been together in 2-3 ish years. We drink, I am very petite so I know my limit is 3 shots of hard liquor. Which is what I did, but (I suspect it's my meds) I got shit faced and had no control of myself after that. We wrapped up and went inside. 

The ""friend"" that eventually ended up raping me and my other guy friend helped me get settled (because apparently I am a crazy drunk if I drink Jameson) into bed. The ""friend"" told my other guy friend to go home and that he would take care of me. After that it's hazy in my memory. 

I remember him being on top of me and covering my mouth forcefully. I couldn't make any noises. He was in me and attempting to have sex with me. I was obviously dry because I had no idea what the fuck was happening so he eventually gave up fucking me and instead took my head and forced me to deep throat him until I almost puked. He didn't finish. So we slept. I woke up again to him fingering me until I was wet enough, at this point I thought he was my boyfriend? He ended up finishing.

Afterwards I went to the room where my lesbian friend was sleeping and I told her what happened jokingly. Later in the morning we talked about it more and she wants to kill our ""friend."" She is a witness to how little he drank and kept mentioning that he not only raped me but cheated on his girlfriend....",relationship_advice
TIFU by being accidentally racist,"So this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.



Recently Ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so I thought I'd go along. 

So anyway here I am about to play my first game of chess ever. I sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (I should now mention my opponent was African American). The chess teacher says ""first rule of chess, whites go first."" 

I think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. 

So I grab a pawn and slide it forward, then I look up expecting my opponent to make his move. Instead I'm met with a look of confusion and horror, I begin to hear laughter from the people watching. 

I then realize my error ""oooh you meant the pieces"" I murmur. 
The teacher nods. 

Now everyone thinks I'm a massive racist.

A few months later she asked how i felt if she met him to 'catch up' as he had left her work, i was not happy at all and made it known, she said she told me about it to be clear and honest, no funny business, etc. I said again, I'm not happy but do whatever because otherwise I'm 'controlling' but I trust her to make the right decision.

*I am perfectly okay with funerals. Casket, open-casket/ viewing, decent burials, etc.   It's the excessive extravagance that we slap onto these ceremonies, just for the stuff to then go to waste. That I don't get.*   


Disclaimer: I have only been to one memorial/ funeral (I'm unsure if there's a distinction) and even so, we were only permitted to be there partially.  M grandfather's funeral was a fairly simple affair since he was cremated, and there wasn't much by way of memorial. Just a simple table at the church with a few photos of him. This unpopular opinion is about the non-cremated dead

&#x200B;

Maybe I'm in the minourity here, but.. I've come to be very confused about funerals. I just don't get it. Yes, respect the dead. Give them some respect (to a point). Don't be disrespectful, I agree.

But the whole process of a funeral? What even is the point of that? I understand if some people wish to pay respects to a body (even if it's just an empty shell now), but we waste so many resources on these... for lack of a better term, death ceremonies. We're spending tens of thousands of dollars on Caskets! Body preservations! SUITS, MAKEUP AND CLOTHES!

... Just to.. you know... shut the lid on the box and bury the damn thing completely, never to be seen or touched again. All of that preparation taken. All of that money spent. Just to.. throw a corpse in a box and smother it in earth. Large caskets, carefully carved, wood-stained and sanded/ smoothed... fancy pillow for the lifeless corpse to put its head on and making it seem 'bed-like'. The corpse actually having had people take the time to dress it, and cover it in makeup to hide the usual deathly pallor.We even have the body preserved!! But... literally -why-? We're going to see the dead body maybe... one last time and that's it.

To Reiterate and be clear: I agree that we should to a point, give a modicum of respect for the dead. Don't just toss a dead body naked in a ditch. But to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on a funeral, casket, and such? That just feels.. gaudy and incredibly wasteful. Particularly when one realizes that you just spent all that money, just to literally have it buried under several feet of dirt (or mud, depending on if its rainy).",unpopularopinion
"Returned a $1,175 computer back to Walmart and they refuse to refund the money.","Hi all! So I put a gaming comp on layaway with Walmart a few weeks ago so I could make payments versus $1,000+ at once. 

I finally paid it off brought it home, and the motherboard was cracked. So I returned it, unfortunately they said that amount was too much for a gift card (as I was going to immediately buy a new one) but my mom has a Walmart debit card they said it would be available to me immediately. 

Well it immediately locked her account for fraud, so we called the Walmart money people and they said all we needed to do was submit the receipt as proof. 

We did and called back and the lady said that the receipt wasn't good enough?? She said that it had a ""different balance"" on all the receipts but that's because it was layaway and I made payments! 

She told my mother the account may never be unlocked as we did not have sufficient proof? 

I'm totally distraught, I'm a college student and I don't have extra funds this was something I worked hard for. 

Any and all advice is welcome I'm desperate. I am in the US, specifically Florida

AITA for throwing away my daughters vibrator,"I have a 18 year old daughter who lives with me. She's in college so I let her live here rent free. I also have 3 other children who are 11, 6 and 2. My 11 and 18 year old share a bathroom, and the 6, 2 year old and myself use mine.

My daughters bathroom is currently out of order due to some pipes so we've all been sharing mine. 

My 18 year old daughter has been taking long long baths lately, and I know why. She's masturbating. It's uncomfortable but I want her to know her body.

But she's been leaving her vibrator on the counter when she leaves my bathroom. I've told her 4 separate times she needs to take it with her, because her siblings don't need to get a hold of it and if she keeps doing this I'm going to get rid of it.

This morning it was once again left on my counter, so I threw it away in the outside trash. 

She stormed into my bedroom while I was getting ready yelling at me about how dare I throw away something she paid for with her own money, and I'm just trying to shame her blah blah blah. 

It was a relatively expensive vibrator, and I do feel slightly bad about throwing it away instead of just reprimanding her again, but I feel like I had to because she wasnt listening.


AITA for throwing away my daughters vibrator?

ETA: I'm her mom. I'd be fucking mortified if I was her father and I knew my teenage daughter was masturbating in my bathtub. My husband and I are divorced.

ETA #2: I thought about hiding it, but I know my child, she would get another one and keep doing it. Doing something extreme like throwing it away was the only way to get my point across. While yes she is an adult and she bought it with her own money, she lives in my house with 0 bills, 0 responsibilities. She goes to school (which I'm SO PROUD of) and she works part time. Other than that, I care for all her needs. This is my house and my young children and she didn't respect my boundaries I tried to gently but firmly set the first time. Maybe that makes me the asshole and I will full heartedly accept that.


Last edit but I'm fixing the bathroom. I'm not just leaving it alone, but it takes a while. This has only been over the course of a week.

Also I don't think I'm the asshole and I think I'm completely justified but I'm not gonna delete the thread because 1) it's on the front page and 2) there's some good discussion going on.

TIFU by having ADHD while having sex.,"Unlike other TIFUs, this indeed happened today. Just a few minutes ago, actually. And yes, this is a throwaway for reasons. 

&#x200B;

It's Sunday afternoon, and it's a pretty lazy day here at my house. The husband indicates that he's in the mood for bedroom activities, and while I didn't particularly feel the need for carnal relations, I thought - what the hey, there's nothing better to do. 

&#x200B;

So I put the two kiddos (10 and 12 yo girls) on the Netflix (She-Ra, because fuck yeah, girl power!), and we proceeded to the bedroom activity portion of this FU. 

&#x200B;

Well, this is the portion of my story where I realize that my FU may have actually been last night. Because last night is when I forgot to take my meds. It happens more often than it should, really. I'm a teacher, and it's summer time, and so forgetting to take my meds happens more often when I'm not on a regular schedule (and yes, I have a reminder in my phone, but sometimes I'm playing games and I turn off the alarm, thinking that I'll remember when I'm done with this level, but I never do...)

&#x200B;

So anywhat, the husband starts his dirty finger dance on the honeypot, and I'm trying to get into it, but my mind is bouncing around like a Cirque d'Soylay trapeze dancer. Should my new Pathfinder be a human or half-elf? What about Trump and his assholeyness? I wonder how many pics we took in Bryce Canyon this week... We should really finish our moving plans soon. (You know, the stupid stuff your mind isn't supposed to think about while your clit is being dj'ed). 

&#x200B;

After a couple of minutes, I finally just tell the hubs that he might as well just jump right on in and do what needs doing, because he might as well finish his deed since mine won't get done right now. So he obliges, but then starts taking his sweet time. I try to find a way to tell him, in not so many words, to just ""Wham bam, thank you ma'am"" and call it good, but the first words that come to mind pop out: 

&#x200B;

""Bop it!"" 

&#x200B;

I instantly start giggling, then follow up with 

""Twist it."" 

""Flick it."" 

&#x200B;

At first, the hubs tries to power through. But my giggles turned into hysterical laughing. I'm talking the kind where you're holding your stomach, sounding like a flock of Canadian goose migrating south for the winter. 

&#x200B;

Needless to say, his ability to ""Bop it"" deflates, and he's now in the shower, I'm assuming finishing the job himself with fewer distractions. I went and took my med, and hopefully I have better focus-ability to make it up to him later. 

&#x200B;

TL:DR - Forgot my meds, failed to focus on sexy times, and now I'll never be able to play ""Bop It"" with a straight face again in my life.",tifu

If you drizzle ketchup over your fries rather than dipping them then you don't love yourself.,"I dont know when, how, or who conceived the notion that this is acceptable behaviour. Ketchup and fries is a sacred meal time experience and if you're pouring ketchup over the fries you're a disgrace to humanity.

With the drizzle method you end up with too much ketchup on top and not enough ketchup to compliment the fries at the bottom. You may think its okay to just reapply ketchup after you eat through the first layer but then you're just using more ketchup than necessary.

Dipping is the way it was meant to be because you not only can you control the amount of ketchup you have on each fry but also how it is applied.

Par example, you can simply dip and get a good sized glob on the end or you can smear and have a conservative but evenly applied amount of ketchup.

Pouring ketchup over fries is downright inhumane and needs to stop. ",unpopularopinion

I just wanted to thank you all for the kind and wonderful support I received, it truly helps me get through the darkest time in my life.

I've blocked him on everything, he has resorted to trying to contact my friends and begging them to get me to give him a second chance. They've stood strong by me and have blocked him as well now.

My lovely boss transferred me to another branch of the business and I have moved state and asked the postal manager to withhold all my details.

I now house share with another person (mainly to feel more safe) and I'm starting to rebuild my life. I'm not dating at the moment but have been asked out a few times. I've picked up doing culinary classes and have a trip booked to europe and Egypt in 2 weeks time. I've discovered that I love not sharing my ice cream and I read a lot more, because I can. 

I've been told I'm beautiful and I'm starting to believe it once again. My ex made me realise that I don't need anyone to feel great about myself but that in the future when I'm ready, I'll be with someone who is deserving of me and someone who is worth building a kind and wonderful life with.

My family is abusive and I want to emancipate myself,"I'm a 16 year old girl. I live with my aunt and uncle and cousins. My maternal grandfather also stays with us. My parents passed away in a car accident two years ago - I was in the car but I survived - and I was taken in by my maternal aunt. My dad grew up an orphan so there is no family on his side.

The last two years have been hell for me. Not only because I still can't get over losing my parents (I cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. My mom was actually estranged from her family. She was white, and my dad was black. Her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. They have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and I guess I'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

They have told me just that on several occasions. That my existence is a mistake. I get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. And I'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. Sometimes it gets physical. Sometimes it feels like I'm trapped in a minefield. I have to be so careful about where I step cause the repercussions may be explosive. My ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. He has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

I can't live like this anymore. I'm an absolute emotional mess. I wanna emancipate myself but I don't know how to go about it. I know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 I'm close with a set of twins at school - I'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. Their parents own a farm and I work regularly with the family. I'm also into photography and I've been doing real good with shooting weddings. They are very lucrative and I've saved up a substantial amount. With summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but I also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

The parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. I've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. I don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

I would really appreciate advice.

Thank you

UPDATE [MD] Condo Assoc. sent a letter citing inappropriate bylaws to restrict my kid from doing basically anything.,"OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c1ft6g/md_condo_assoc_sent_a_letter_citing_inappropriate/

The board meeting was yesterday. When the floor was opened to owner commentary, I raised my hand and told them that we'd moved in about 6 months ago and what I liked about the community before telling them about the letter and what it said. I ended with, ""When I got this letter, it made me feel like Community isn't a welcoming place for young families."" 

It turns out that the letter was sent out without the full knowledge and consent of the board. In fact, they had no idea that it was sent out. The president of the board was livid that I and 6 other families that I know of received this letter and told us that our kids were allowed and encouraged to play on their scooters and bikes on the sidewalk. They don't want the kids to play in the parking lots for their safety. They also ask that kids stay out of plantings and off the grass. Then she referred us to the playground that has several safety concerns and mentions the new layers of wood-chips that had been put down at the beginning of summer. 

I told her that while we appreciate the new layer of wood-chips I still had some safety concerns. 

* The end of the slide is about two feet off the ground and when my three year old goes down she shoots off the end like a cannon.

*The nylon covering on the climbing structure has come off and I'm worried my kids fingers could get hurt. 

*There's a strange lurid green fungus the size of a hockey puck by the swings. When you poke it it lets off spores and oozes. 

They'll have a contractor come out to give an estimate to fix the playground. 

The person that sent the letter was counting on us to be intimidated by official stationary, not to talk to each other, and discouraged by the inconvenient board meetings. I'm especially upset that six or seven families that I know of received this letter and four of them were renters/people of color. One person is a single man whose nephew visited him for a weekend and brought his bike. I plan on joining the board once I've been here a bit longer and implementing community-building events so that people don't feel so alone.

I've got a couple requests for an update, and to be honest I could have given an update the night after it happened but I didn't want to post too much if something changed. I'm sorry for ducking out of the thread early too. I read the first 400 or so comments and wanted to respond and give information to some of the folks asking, but I didn't really have time since she found the thread. I tried to obfuscate enough details that this wouldn't happen, but it's a unique situation and it got pretty popular and I think one of her friends clued her in.  I hope no other new pet parents had to explain this thread to their SOs.

&#x200B;

Some of you were asking for specific instances of abuse, and to be honest I didn't really think she was abusing him. I just thought that the way she was interacting with him might be more suitable for another cat. Molly did wonderfully with our previous cat, but she was a different cat.

&#x200B;

My original plan was to sit down with her and try to have one more honest conversation about our cat's comfort level in this house. Something needed to be done before he turned into a nervous wreck. None of this happened sadly. She came home and had it out with me about everything from the cat to some issues with her family and circled back around to our previous cat, who she kind of accused me of killing (she had end-stage cancer and stopped eating and was having daily seizures. The vet encouraged us to put her to sleep). I'd rather not go into too much detail here, but you guys were right. Our relationship had a lot of problems and adopting our cat just made them undeniable. I know some people accused my post of validation-seeking, but honestly it's difficult to tell things are bad when you're looking at the situation from the inside. Even if it was my fault, it's obviously time for things to end.

AITA for not wanting my husband's best friend over every week.,"My husband and I just got into (another) fight because his best friend who comes over every Wednesday is (again) staying the night. 

My husband and this friend have had a Wednesday night ""date"" where the guy comes over to our house to ""jam"" every week for the last two years, and I'm getting to the point that I want to hit the guy over the head with whatever is closest at hand every time he is around. 

Buckle up. This is probably going to be a long one.... if you make it through all of this you are my hero. 

At first he was supposed to come over just for a few hours on Wednesday nights to play guitar with my husband while I was at work. Over time I have stopped working late Wednesday's but the jam session continues. Which was fine. However, for the last year they have barely touched the guitars and instead the guy just comes over to get high (on pot). Neither my husband or I get high with him (I don't enjoy pot and my husband isn't much into it either, but we aren't morally against it so we didn't say anything early on when we should have). 

Now that he is always high here, he NEVER leaves at the end of the night. Just expects to sleep over. But he doesn't have a regular sleep schedule so instead of sleeping while we are, he is wandering around our house all night (in his boxers) making noises, watching tv, getting nonstop text alerts from other friends and ect. This always wakes me up and I have to pass by him on the way to the bathroom. At these points he always has demands. Like: ""I want to watch this random movie your husband said you had. Find it for me."" Or ""you need to change your litter box right now, because your cat just pooped and I can't stand the smell."" He always says he'll leave when my husband goes for work at 8am, but then complains that he couldn't sleep until 6am, so he ends up sleeping until mid day. At which point he just decides to stay until my husband gets home from work and then the whole thing starts over again. What's supposed to be one night a week often turns into at least two every week. 

On top of never leaving, he has started showing up HOURS before my husband gets off work on Wednesday's. My husband has told him ""my home is your home"" so he just comes right in. This wouldn't be a problem if he could self entertain. But no. He comes in and will just walk into our bedroom (where I'm hiding) sit down on the bed, take a hit of his shit, and start talking to me through whatever I'm doing/watching on tv. 

Every time he is here he eats A LOT of our food (gets the munchies, plus regular meals) but never once has had the courtesy to bring anything of his own, or to share, or to replace what he is eating here. He just goes into our fridge and pantry and eats whatever he wants because my husband told him our home was his. 

My husband is always begging me to be nice and not say anything while he is here because he is lonely and needs friends.... except he has his other best friend living with him, and is constantly going on weekend trips all over the country to visit his other friends.  Not to mention those nonstop text message alerts all night. 

Dealing with this guy is like hanging out with a 17 year old stoner non stop. He farts and burps as loud as possible wherever. Whenever. Is demanding and needy, but completely rude at the same time. Saying things like ""dude! You actually made your house look SORTA nice this week."" (As I was prepping for Christmas), and ""so you do sometimes make an effort on your looks"" (when I had gone somewhere nice and come home with makeup on). He also complains non stop about the food I make (yet eats it all anyway). 

This year for my birthday we couldn't afford to get any gifts, so I asked my husband instead to line up his days off so we could spend four days just us together...... then this guy broke up with his girlfriend and my husband begged me to let him come over just for a bit on the first evening. Que TWO full weeks of him not going home, and demanding all of my husband's time. I spent ""our time"" and my birthday, holed up in our room alone. 

Then, Christmas comes. I had invited my whole family to our house and tried to make things extra special because it was the first time I got to see my parents on Christmas in more than ten years. This guy's mom had just moved to another state BUT this guy has plenty of money and no job to work around so he could have easily made the trip to her for Christmas. But he didn't. Then his other friend/housemate also went out of town and he threw a ""woe is me, I'm all alone one Christmas Eve, no one loves me"" tantrum until my husband invited him to our house. He shows up. Gets high. And is a complete ass to everyone. Then throws a fit when he decides to sleep over because he has to sleep on the couch in a sleeping bag (my family were in the other beds.) the next morning we sit down to breakfast and he lets out this HUGE stinky fart right at the table like it's nothing, then proceeds to dish himself up 90% of the food and just generally be a douche. My family was flat out disgusted by him and his behavior and couldn't wait to leave. He stayed for three days. 

I feel like an ass hole because he is my husband's best friend and I don't want to make them not hang out, and honestly he hasn't done anything truly terrible. He's just annoying as shit. I fucking dread every Wednesday, and then I'm super irritated the whole time he's here. Which I hide from him, at my husband's request, but then my husband and I always end up fighting over him not leaving at the end of the night. 

I'm honestly one or two Wednesday's away from homicide with this guy, and all this I've told you is just the tip of the iceberg. 

If you've made it this far, please tell me AITA for being upset at my husband for letting this guy stay over again tonight, and wanting a substantial break from his best friend? 



TL;DR My husband's best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. AITA for not wanting him to come over for a LONG time? 








Thank you all for your overwhelming response!! I haven't been able to reply to all of you, but I want you to know I've read every post and I appreciate all of your opinions (even the ones calling me a shrew) and your great advice! 

Some clarification and an update: In case you weren't already sick of reading all this >< 


Clarification 1: As some have pointed out, there isn't much of an action here for me to ask AITA about. I'm sorry I didn't make it clearer originally. The question is am I unreasonable and being an Ass Hole for wanting a break from having this friend over. My husband and I fought over this last night and he feels I'm being overly upset and needlessly irritable at said friend. You've already read how I feel about it. 


Clarification 2: This post, admittedly doesn't give much positive about the friend. His friend has been in my husband's life since he was in grade school, and while the friend is over they do actively chat, watch movies, and generally hang out while I actively hide and feel irritated. All this stuff for sure could look like an exaggeration if it all happened in the last few days, but this is sorta my laundry list of the last two years of grievances which have been building up over time. On a regular Wednesday he is just stoned, flatulent, and childish, which while annoying, isn't really actively douchy. He has done some very nice things for my husband, such as paying to take him to some very expensive concerts so that they could both nerd out over their favorite guitar players Live. I -clearly- don't like the guy, but my husband gets a lot of enjoyment out of their friendship and I'm not saying that has to stop. Just that -I- need a break. Also, my husband DOES have other friends, they just have lives so he only gets to hang out once every few months with them. He is also in a band with other friends whom he sees regularly every Monday night. 

Clarification 3: My husband doesn't see a problem with how he speaks to me because according to him ""the guy just has poor social skills, that comment about your makeup was a compliment.""

Clarification 4: He smokes a vape style pot pen, not a physical bud, which has less residual scent and is why my husband told him he could do it in the house. Before he started using I was ok with him. He still had poor manners, but he wasn't nearly as bad as he is now, and he never spent the night (or longer). Back before the pot I even enjoyed hanging out with the two of them every so often. Oh and I KNOW my husband occasionally also imbibes with him, which isn't something that makes me mad. He doesn't go overboard like his friend. 

UPDATE: When I woke up this morning I noticed that my phone was buzzing…. And buzzing…. And buzzing…. As all these awesome comments kept pouring in. I have never really had much success on Reddit, so when I looked and saw how many comments there were I said ""Oh My GoD!"" Of course my husband asked what was wrong and I said ""I told the internet the story of ***** and asked if I was the ass hole for what we fought over last night."" He said..""Oh"" and that was it. BUT then on his way out of the bedroom he said ""I'm going to get him up"", and by the time I was dressed and out of the room they guy was out of the house and driving away. Hallelujah!!! 

Forty minutes later when he got to work I received a text message telling me how I was his best friend and that he loves me more than the world ect. Then we texted back and forth and he said ""I really feel like we both contribute to it. I feel like you are overly grumpy on things pertaining to *****. But at the same time, I invite him to come up extra days, or stay the night without running it by you. I feel we could both do better and relieve a lot of stress and frustration. Do you agree?""  

He then called a few minutes later and I told him that I know I'm grumpy but I feel like it's reasonably so. I also told him I didn't want to force them not to be friends just that -I- needed a break from the friend. Then I gave him some possible solutions such as hanging out at his house every other week, or have a set time that the guy needs to stop smoking in order to drive home later (thanks guys! Great suggestions!) and he agreed to consider other arrangements with the hang out time so that I could have some time away from the friend, and we agreed to talk more about it when he is off work tonight. Although I can tell he STILL isn't seeing a problem other than my attitude : / 

Again thank you to everyone who has commented! 







TL;DR My husband's best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. AITA for not wanting him to come over for a LONG time?

AITA For Wanting No Military Uniforms At My Wedding?,"My SO and I are ready to make our 5 year relationship official.


A bit of background, we met online and were long distance for 3 years before spending 2 years together travelling back and forth. We are planning a K1 visa and are ready to start the 90 days this year for a September wedding.


His BIL was in the Marines 8 years ago and always wears his uniform to special occasions. I straight up said I would not allow this as this Wedding is a celebration of love and committment and not a ""oh you fought for the country."" I would prefer if we kept any type of war, fighting, negativity away from our day. 


His BIL is causing a fuss, and as you can tell im not from the US but my husband to be has my back on this. This day of ours, we want it to be about love and us. Even his wife is rolling her eyes.


AITA for not understanding his BIL's uniform?

AITA For asking my wife for an open relationship after two years without sex?,"It feels weird to type but next year i will be 30. I have been married since i was 22. My wife is the same age.

3 years ago she had just beaten cervical cancer. She had surgery, and she was a soldier throughout the whole process. I am very proud of her.

After the surgery we didnt have sex for obvious reasons and i accepted that. However she still gave me oral sex frequently. I would try to please her as best i could without hurting her but its tough.

Eventually her sex drive disappeared completely. She just did not want to be intimate anymore. This has been going on for two years. She will give me oral sex on my birthday or special occasions but thats it.

I am still very attracted to my wife. I love her very much. I do not want to give up sex for the rest of my life.

I have talked to her numerous, countless times and shes just not into it anymore. Its not a pain thing but a desire thing.

I have been reading up on open relationships, basically just flings to satisfy my needs as a man while still living and loving my wife. She was not receptive of the idea at all to say the least.

Crying, yelling, you name it. She doesnt understand why id even ask. Even after i explain. I want to grow old with her but i dont want to be old now and give up sex.

I dont even know what i couldve done different in this besides just shut up and be celibate forever. ",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by having a really high pain tolerance.,"So bonus points because this actually happened today but the story starts about a week and a half ago. 

Day one: I am lactose Intolerant, and I had a stomach ache, no big deal I probably ate something I shouldn't have. No harm done.

Day 4: stomach ache is still there. I'm a medical professional, I realized that my abdomen on my right lower side was what hurt. Wrote it off as having too much ice cream.

Day 6: I thought to myself it could be appendicitis, but I shrugged it off because appendicitis is supposed to be super painful right? This was like 4/10. 

Day 7:  I realized I had a lump near my anus, I thought huh that's not good, probably just a hemorrhoid, I've had a few before no biggie.

Day 9: this hemorrhoid is the most  painful one I've ever had, 6/10 I'll pick up some cream and Advil long lasting relief capsules from Target should be able to push right through.


Day 11:  I start my vacation tomorrow and am going out of town, (I work in a hospital for context) well that hemorrhoid is really starting to hurt at this point, like a 7/10. So I go work thinking okay I can get a doctor to look at the hemorrhoid and give me some ointment or steroids. 

Well I'm not having a vacation now, because I'll be in the hospital for a few days. Apparently my appendix ruptured a week ago and I just figured it was a stomach ache. Turns out that hemorrhoid was actually pain from the appendix ruptured radiating. The doctor told me that if I didn't come to the hospital within the next couple of days I'd be dead. 

TlDR; having a high pain tolerance finally has a downside, didn't realize my appendix blew up until way too late. Ruined my vacation.

Sorry for format I'm on mobile, I'm also on Dilaudid and morphine (one then the other) so please go easy on me. Credit to my girlfriend who begged me to go to the hospital before vacation, I was going to hold off till after a 2 week vacation that I would have died on.


Update: so I had a few people question why I felt Pain by my anus and how was a lumped formed? So I talked to a surgeon who finally spend the time explaining it, when my appendix ruptured it caused everything else to inflame. The lump I was feeling was pus caused by the colon and gravity causes it to go down.



UPDATE 2: apparently I have Crohn's disease :/ lots of pain at the moment. I'll update once everything is for sure.",tifu
LPT: Initiate handshakes with professional women just as you would with men.,"I'm always surprised to see men not initiating handshakes with professional women as they would with other men.

Edit.  Thanks for the upvotes.   I wanted to note that some have commented that it may not be the same in all cultures so know your circumstance.

[UPDATE] GF and I (26M/F) got into a huge fight over a keyboard,"[Previous post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqh813/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/)

Short EDIT at bottom.
&nbsp; 

We met earlier tonight and sat down to talk. I was somewhat prepared to end things with her, so I suggested we meet at her place, so that I could bail if things went south...and they did.

&nbsp; 

Even though I thought I made my post as anonymous as possible, one of my GFs coworkers figured out who the post was about (GF's age, working HR [which I mentioned in a comment], same computer problems, dating a programmer, etc) and sent it to my GF. The reason she wanted to meet early was because she was FURIOUS that I had made the post, 'airing our dirty laundry.' In a sense, I guess she was right, because at least on person had figured it out. My GF never used Reddit so I figured I was safe.
There's a strong chance she'll read this one as well, lol.

&nbsp; 


Anyway, she immediately began berating me, telling me that I made her look bad in the post and lied about the details of our argument to get people on my side. I asked her to point out ANY part of it that wasn't true, or where I had lied. Long story short, she couldn't point to a single thing. I definitely raised my voice when I told her that if she looked bad, it's only because of her actions. I told her I only made the post to get some perspective on the matter. The post was 100% accurate and she knew it. 

&nbsp; 

She began to tear up and asked me if I really was considering leaving her over the keyboard. I asked her if she understood that this WASN'T ABOUT THE KEYBOARD. It was about the way she acted towards me when I was trying to do her a favor. She stayed silent and didn't answer. I asked her what had prompted this outburst, if everything was OK with her. I asked if anything had happened with her friends, parents, or at work that was upsetting her and may have lead to this.

&nbsp; 

She got really defensive, asking ""Are you calling me crazy?"" and ""Do you think I'm unstable?"" I had no idea where she was going with this. I told her I wasn't calling her crazy, but that she had to understand that I was quite confused about how she was acting, and that there had to be a reason for it. 

&nbsp; 

We talked in circles for a bit, and I tried to pry it out of her. I still don't know what caused all of this, because she simply wouldn't tell me. When I realized our conversation was going nowhere, I finally asked her if we were going to have an adult conversation, or if this was the hill she was willing to let the relationship die on. She asked, ""What do you want from me?"" and I said, ""I want an apology.""

&nbsp; 

I'm getting tired of typing so I'll wrap this up quickly. She was absolutely unwilling to apologize. She thought that my ""betrayal"" of posting about this was far worse than her initial behavior was. We talked for about 5 more minutes before I told her that I don't even care anymore. I told her this whole thing was exhausting, as she wasn't willing to help us get to the bottom if this. That we should just break up. I didn't waste any time making my way to the door.

&nbsp; 

As I was leaving, she asked if I wanted the keyboard back. She didn't ask to be nice; she was definitely trying to get on my nerves. I could tell by her tone of voice. I told her she could keep it as long as she promised never to call or text me again.

&nbsp; 

I've been getting TONS of not-so-nice messages from her friends (which finally prompted me to delete my FB). She obviously told her friends some false version of the story which made it seem like I really did leave her over the keyboard. I couldn't care less, as I'll never be seeing any of them again.

&nbsp; 

We only dated for ~4 months, so in the end, I don't feel terribly heartbroken. Mostly just relief that it's over. But...also confusion. Still have no idea why she acted out.

&nbsp; 

TL;DR: She wouldn't apologize or tell me what was wrong. After an exhausting conversation, I decided to end it.

&nbsp; 

**And to the people who had some unkind words towards me because I use a Razer keyboard: Pound sand, dorks. I like what I like.**

VERY SHORT EDIT: She called earlier today and was very apologetic. My assumption is that she saw this post and read all the comments detailing how I was right for leaving her, among other things. I told her that she had her chance to apologize.",relationship_advice

"If it's socially acceptable for women to put ""Sorry, no short men"" as a requirement in online dating profiles, then it should also be acceptable for men to say ""Sorry, no flat-chested women"", or ""no overweight women"" in theirs.","I understand that a women may only want a guy of a certain height for whatever reason they may have. That's fine. You are attracted to who you are attracted to and there is nothing wrong with that. 

Maybe she just wants to warn a guy before wasting their time with meeting up somewhere, or stop them from getting their hopes up. I get that too. 

However, if a man were to say  ""Sorry, no (blank)  women"", they would get accused of body shaming and everyone would lose their shit. 

It's a double standard, and its absolute bullshit. Whereas someone would say of the woman ""Oh, she's just very selective and knows what she wants"", they would say of the man ""What a pig! How dare he!"". No one would ever say ""He's just very selective and wants to find the perfect soul mate"".

Minecraft is a genuinely fun and interesting game. It's not cringy or just for 12 year olds.,"I've been playing Minecraft for almost 10 years now. I remember the golden days with channels like ""SkydoesMinecraft"", ""ASFJerome"" and ""Bajancanadian"". I have always liked Minecraft, as it's a world where you can build literally anything, in your own little world. There's still a considerable amount of people that play it, but Minecraft has definitely been one of the highlights of my childhood.

"TIFU by probably ruining a girl's life, forever, via Capture the Flag.","Today I fucked up. There's a girl in my Ecology class. Let's call her ""Madge"". Madge is your go-getting try-hard holier-than-thou know-it-all with an unchanging facial expression I can only describe as ""cat trying to shit a peach pit"". One of those constant-frowners, and constant-downers. 

I even tried to get along with Madge at the start; I'd sit by her and try to engage her (read: humor her) with conversations in relevant topics about Ecology, such as the thrilling handedness of apes or edge-of-your-seat songbird plumage complexity, but just trying to be civil was a futile endeavour. Expecting Madge to be civil with you because you were civil with her is like expecting the lion not to eat you because you didn't eat it. Madge was born to be an asshole.

Everything you said to her was met with a ""Pffft"", or a dramatic roll of the eyes, and a quick retort such as ""Well, if you'd actually *read* Carter et al. 2007, you would have known that..."" She had to be better and smarter than everyone, at everything, all the time. And boy, that shit got real old, real quick. So I stopped sitting by her. And began to loathe her. With a pre-occupied disposition. I thought about her twice today before even writing this, that's how much I don't like her.

Fast forward to the first Capture the Flag game of the year. Being a Freshman, I thought I'd attend as a way to get out of my residence room and meet some people. The first game was at about 8:00PM, the campus was already dark, and I showed up just wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Out of 150+ people (who knew Capture the Flag was so popular?) I ended up being possibly the most under-dressed person there. Camouflage, Ghillie suits, face-paint, and black morph costumes were just some of the norm. This was like Capture the Flag Olympics. 

Teams were divided into short sleeve vs. long sleeve, and the ""flags"" were two bicycle lights. I began to mingle with fellow short-sleeves... and that's when I saw her. Madge. Black boots, black pants, black turtleneck, black scarf, black cap, black gloves. She was going all Call of Duty for this game -- of course. Why wouldn't she be a try-hard at Capture the Flag too? And I just knew I'd have to tag her the fuck out. This was my chance to prove I was better at something.

The first few rounds, us short-sleeves did terribly because no one stayed behind to defend, so we lost 3 rounds promptly. Each time they blew the whistle, I could hear Madge laughing. I could hear it. So I switched to defense. To prevent ""camping"", there was a 50 meter buffer around each ""flag"". Conveniently for me, there was a group of hedges 50 meters away from my flag. So I hid in the hedges.

Each time anyone from the other team tried to sneak up to our flag, I'd jump out of the hedges, startle the hell out of them, and that would give me the time I needed to run up and tag them out. I'd probably tagged out 8-10 people in about 15 minutes, when the stars aligned, and I saw her. Madge. Walking through the shadows along the side of a building, headed straight for our flag, thinking she was so sneaky with all her matching black gear. This was it. It was *my time to shine*.

But I was too excitable. I bounded from the hedges like Sea Biscuit while she was still a good 40-50 feet away. So I yelled ""AAAaarrgh!"" to try to emphasize the startling effect. She shrieked in surprise, but without missing a beat, she spun around 180 degrees and headed back for her ""side"" at a dead sprint. I then realized that if she got to her side before I caught her, she'd be ""out of play"" and I couldn't tag her out -- that was an impossible embarrassment, I couldn't allow it. I took off too, at a dead sprint. Like Gimli, I'm not so much for long runs, but dangerous across short distances. I was gaining on her, and now confidently puffed up, with a laugh I shouted ""YOU CAN RUN IF YOU WANT, I'LL JUST CATCH YOU WHEN YOU'RE TIRED!""

The chase lasted probably 100-150 feet before she tripped on a tree root and fell pretty hard, but made no attempt to get back up. As I got closer, I realized she had stooped to a whole new low - playing the crying game, surely exaggerating an injury that would thus make my ""tagging"" of her distasteful. But then as I got closer still, I realized she was *really* crying, like *hysterically* crying. I was still mad, so as I got up to her I said ""Crying won't fucking help"", at which point she rolled on to her back and looked up at me and shouted ""GET THE FUCK AWAY!"". I leaned down to make eye contact and said ""it's just a fucking game"", to which she cocked an eyebrow and said ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!""

And then it hit me.

I did not recognize this girl.

*This was not Madge.*

This was some girl walking to the bus station after a night class.

Horrified, mouth hanging open, the rolodex of my mind spun as I suddenly imagined what it must have been like from her perspective: a large, strange, bearded, sweaty, under-dressed man jumped out of the bushes screaming ""AAARRRRrrrgh!"", and when she ran, he ran too, screaming ""YOU CAN RUN IF YOU WANT, I'LL JUST CATCH YOU WHEN YOU'RE TIRED"", and when he saw her crying, said ""Crying won't fucking help"".

I wanted to apologize, I wanted to introduce myself, I wanted to explain, but all I could get out was ""Hey... sorry -- it was, it's just... Hi, I'm... Hey, you know, Capture the Flag?...

I never ended up tagging her, or Madge for that matter, and I never went back to Capture the Flag after that (I hear it may be getting cancelled) but I probably caused some seriously deep-seated anxieties about night classes that will haunt that poor girl forever.

Dear night class girl, if you're a Redditor, I am so sorry. I'm actually a pretty nice guy, really.

TL;DR - Today I fucked up by wanting to get back at a snooty know-it-all from Ecology class by chasing her down at a night game of Capture The Flag only to realize I'd chased down (and probably subsequently scarred) some girl from night class who wasn't even playing.

Normally he means to just check out of the window and see if either of his parents cars are in the driveway which they weren't so I tell him we're all good. We proceed to have very loud, somewhat kinky sex. 
After we're finished he goes to the bathroom to clean up and makes a jokey comment about how we left the bedroom door open and that it's a good thing nobody else is home.

"My [23M] gf [25F] has a disgusting fetish, and I don't know if I can handle it.","So, I met this beautiful woman about 7 months ago at an alumni function. We hit it off and honestly she's everything I could ask for. I'm not sure if I'm still in the honeymoon phase, but so far everything is working out and she even moved in with me two months ago with no problems.

However, this past holiday season she started doing something gross. Honestly, it's so disgusting I haven't even asked my friends or family for help on this matter. On Christmas Eve, I woke up pleasantly surprised to see that she was cooking breakfast. But, when I looked at my scrambled eggs, it looked really really sketchy. It looked way too moist. My gf told me she used a fancy cheese which is why it was extra moist and smelly. I believed her and ate it. The texture was absolutely horrendous, but taste-wise it was fine. She beamed and started planning our holiday. 

Then on New Year's Eve, we were cuddling and doing couple things. She brought strawberries and whipped cream. We did some fun with the whipped cream and she fed me the strawberries. Then she chewed up a berry and fed it to me. I thought it was weird, but I was so horny I didn't mind. We finished the rest of the berries in the same manner, and the subsequent sex was AMAZING. 

But... now she's starting to chew her food and feed it to me. Sometimes not in a sexual manner. Steak, chicken, salad, eggs, etc. It's so disgusting. When I tell her to stop she starts crying and says I don't love her enough. All of our fights were about this issue. I eventually eat some and its so gross. I recoil whenever I think about the texture. 

Help??? I thought maybe she needs to talk to a therapist or maybe I should contact an ex of hers to see if he went through something similar. She is perfect for me except for this one issue. 


--**Update**-- 
So in the comments below, apparently her saliva started fermenting/digesting the eggs for me. This is probably why it had a sour smell. Also, she's very attractive and needs constant validation. She makes me eat her regurgitated food as ""proof"" that I love her. Besides this, she's honestly my ideal partner. I don't want to throw this away. I will be meeting with an ex of hers tomorrow.

I was wrong.

So very very *very* wrong. There had to be hundreds of spider eyes reflecting back at me. I'm not sure how I made it back in the house but I was told screaming was involved. Now I'm terrified of leaving my house.

Original Post - https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/86t94a/tx_vet_wont_let_us_know_who_has_our_stolen_dog/

I received a phone call earlier this week that our dog had been found hit by a car on the side of the highway about 40 miles from where we live and had to be euthanized shortly after being picked up by animal control. She did not have her collar on but they were able to identify her/call us based on the microchip we originally had placed.

Animal control thinks based on where she found she was likely abandoned on the side of the road, as it's not close or easily accessible to any residential areas.  On Animal control's recommendation, we had them perform a necropsy . They are reasonably certain she had given birth in the past month or two, was slightly underweight from nursing but otherwise healthy.

Thank you everyone who offered advice and kind words. My wife and I read every last comment. A special thanks to those who reached out and helped us contact regional shelters and vets.",legaladvice
"TIFU by accidentally getting my dog super, super high and incurring a $2000 vet bill before I figured out what happened.","So, before I start I want to acknowledge that I am a terrible terrible person and an irresponsible pet parent. I'm pretty much posting here because I expect Reddit to tear me to pieces and I think I deserve it. Everyone I tell this story to IRL just laughs :(

This didn't actually happen today, it happened on Friday. I was in my pool throwing balls for one of my dogs, while the other watched (he doesn't like the pool, only smelly ponds will do for swimming). His name is Leo, and he is a one-year-old border collie. Bouncy and adorable and loving.

He lays down by the side of the pool and I swim over to pet him. He stays lying down. This is not normal for Leo. He is an EXCITABLE dog. Every moment is play time. If I twitch at 3am it's OMG PLAY TIME NOW?! No Leo go back to sleep. So I start calling his name and acting excited. Stays lying down. Barely opens his eyes. I start to worry, so I get out and walk back to the house. He can barely walk. Stumbling and falling to the side. I start freaking out. I get him inside and he lies down on the floor and doesn't move. He's CONSCIOUS, he hasn't collapsed, but all he'll do is open his eyes and look at me he won't get up willingly. So obviously at this point I'm freaking the fuck out. Could be heatstroke, it was a warm day. But there were no signs of it, he had plenty of water and shade, and he wasn't vomiting at all. 

So I take him to my vet. They agree he's not right and want to admit him over night. But they don't have staff there overnight and I'm worrying my brains out, so I take him to the emergency vet about 40 mins away where they have 24 hour staff. I get him settled there, and then they call me and tell me they really can't work out what's wrong, all his tests are normal. Not dehydrated, liver and kidney function are fine. Heart rate's a bit slow but not terribly. But he won't wake up and if he's forced to walk he falls.

So they say they're really worried about him, and they want me to take him to the specialists about an hour away. I inwardly cry, because my other dog has had a stay there before and it's expensive. But a pet parent's gotta do what a pet parents gotta do. So off we go.

We get to the specialist. It's about midnight by this point. I'm exhausted and tearful with worry. They admit him and send me home. Over the next few days, he has every test known to man. All normal. He has about 10 different neurological exams. Normal. He seems to be slowly improving day by day. On Monday they say I might as well take him home, he seems to be improving and they're waiting on some more tests results. Basically, there's nothing they can do right now that I can't do at home.

Over and over again they've asked if he could have gotten access to any toxins. And over and over again I say no. Nothing. He's been with me all day. I can't think of ANYTHING he could have gotten into.

Then on Monday it hit me. I had been cleaning out the outside freezer, and caught him with his head in the trash bag. I shooed him away and thought nothing of it. It was just old food with freezer burn. Nothing that could hurt him. Then I remember. I used to store edibles in that freezer. STRONG edibles. My first batch before I figured out doses. One chocolate would knock me on my ass for a day. My usual dose was 1/4 a chocolate.

He must have eaten one. The poor little fucker was high as a kite for three days.

Happy to say it's been five days now and he's right as rain. Currently demanding I throw balls for him in spite of a three hour walk this morning.

But ... fuck. I feel fucking terrible. I poisoned my dog :( poor little dude.

TL;DR dog ate edible, was high for three days, vet bill was very very expensive.",tifu
"AITA for reporting a worker to his manager for ""ratting me out"" to my husband?","My husband and I live across the street from a grocery store and we're over there pretty much every day and often together.

AITA for telling my wife that when/if she quits her job to be a SAHM I am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore?,"My wife and I have a 6 month old baby girl and a two year old boy. Wife hasn't been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and I actually just got a new job. 

At my old job I was working 45-50 hours a week. At my new job my hours fluctuate a lot — it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. I make a lot more though so there's that. The pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. My wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a SAHM which is what she's wanted. 

The issue is that my wife and I aren't on the same page about what this change would mean. Before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. We also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (Plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). 

I told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. These cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and I also think it's practical.  She was mostly agreeable to that. But then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. 

I told her there was no way I was going to be taking on as many work hours as I am and then come home to cook or clean too. That would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. 

She looked at me like I was some sort of Neanderthal but I think what I'm saying is completely fair. I'm not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. Just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. I recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce I would support her 100%. But I think it's fair that if I'm the sole paycheck and working crazy hours I don't come home to more stress and chaos. 

Obviously my wife and I will have to work this out between ourselves. I'm mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base.

"Stopped for a broken headlight, I now sell drugs.","Location: Long Island, NY

As the title says I was stopped Friday, 6/15/18, at 11:05pm for a broken headlight. The cop asks for my license and registration, after a half hour, he tells me, ""I'm doing you a favor by not bringing you in, your license has been suspended for selling drugs."" I was baffled, at first I laughed out of disbelief, and then was quickly informed that it was not a joke.

My charges are as follows:

* FLD/SURR/LIC/REG PLATES/REV-ART7 (MISD)
* DIVERS VIEW OBSTRUCTED
* NO/INADEQUATE LIGHTS
* OPERATING WITHOUT INSURANCE
* UNLICENSED OPERATOR
* AGGRAVATED UNLIC OP 3RD (MISD)

I'm claiming guilty to my inadequate lights and obstructed view, I had my graduation tassel hanging from my mirror. I'm certain this is a clerical mistake as there are many people with the same name where I live. Because I didn't know my license was suspended for a crime I didn't commit I received charges that I otherwise wouldn't have. I've prepared the following pieces of information in my defense:

* Pay stubs prior to the crime to prove my work hours of 8:00am to 5:00pm.
* Gym check-in's Monday through Friday from the hours of 6:30pm to 8:00pm.
* Driving history.
* Proof of insurance.
* My clean criminal history aside from the alleged crime, leading to my license suspension.

My question to you guys is, what do I do from here? I'm looking for a lawyer before attending my court date in August, is there any way to clear this up prior to the court date? If you've taken the time to read this, THANK YOU!

TLDR: Cop stopped me and informed me that I committed a crime that I didn't. I was not brought to jail.

Update!

Per [u/expatinpa](https://www.reddit.com/u/expatinpa)'s recommendation I've gone ahead and checked my driving history on the DMV website. My Drivers license is in fact suspended and I CAN'T drive. Something more interesting than that, I have three felony charges and two charges of reckless driving in my history.

One of these charges being (6) months after I had passed my drivers test, so I've been driving without an active license for years now. This could explain the trouble I've had in acquiring employment. Thanks for all who have helped so far, I've found something that could potentially improve my living conditions and income in the near future, I'm almost in tears at the moment.

Update (2), 3:12PM

After looking up my driving history the following charges also exist within my driving history, I did not commit any of the charges listed.

* SUSPENSION: 11/01/13 (I was 22 and in my sophomore year of college, and nowhere near the alleged location), FOR THE POSSESSION OR SALE OF DRUGS.  
The above suspension means I have been driving without an active license for five years now
* 3 ACCOUNTS OF MISSED FINE PAYMENTS: Year: 2014.
* RECKLESS DRIVING: 4/15/18
* RECKLESS DRIVING: 2/9/15

"LPT: often, being liked doesn't require you to be interesting/funny.

If people laughed at their joke. If people found their anecdote interesting or shocking. If people agreed with their opinion. 

So the upshot for people who are shy or worry that they're boring is: you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself. Honestly most times all you need to do is take an interest in whoever you're talking to. Listen. Ask questions/follow-up questions. Laugh at their jokes. And they'll come out of it thinking you were a really cool person to talk to, when actually what they mean is you made *them* feel like a really cool person to talk to.

TIFU by failing my road test before it even began.,"So, I've been practicing how to drive for years now. Been taking some online practice tests, passed my written test, been practicing on roads and it all led up to today. I even drove my car to the DMV and the ride there went quite well. I pulled up to the starting line (or more specifically, one car length behind the starting line) and let my instructor get settled in. She told me to drive straight ahead and prepare to make a right turn. I did just that, but as soon as I turned on my right turn signal, she told me to stop and asked what I did wrong. I was honestly taken aback. She told me I ran a stop sign which, to my surprise, was an automatic failure. It turns out there was a stop sign about a car's length from where I ""started"" which I must've missed. I'm aware it was an honest mistake, but it's still probably the dumbest way I could've failed. It's funny. My instructor actually said the same thing that happened to me happened to a guy who tried to take the test three days before I did at the same location.

TL;DR - I ran a stop sign I didn't even see at the starting line, which was an automatic failure.

**Edit:** Thank you so much for all the positive reinforcement, as well as sharing your fellow stories of road test mishaps. My day became better as soon as I read your comments.

Well we found out that Jake unexpectedly passed away in his sleep. When I saw this on Facebook, I saw lots of RIP posts from classmates, but my first reaction was relief. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders.

When I came to class, people were crying and my teacher (50F) said we need to take a moment silence for him. After the silence was done, I just said out loud ''I don't care that Jake died. He was a bully''. People looked at me instantly and gave me death stares, I could hear some people muttering swear words.

But then some people came up to me and thanked me, they said they hated Jake too. Honestly I'm fucking glad he's dead. I feel so much better about my life now.

Just found out my girlfriend [26F] of 6 years was cheating on me while I'm [30M] spending the holidays with her and her family.,"My girlfriend and I have been in a serious relationship for six years, and we started doing long distance relationship about 1.5 years ago due to both of us being in graduate schools. Things have been fine until five months ago when I found out she was using a subscription dating app. I was disappointed and broke up with her, but we eventually got back together because she convinced me that she didn't go on any dates with anyone on the app. I believed her because I know that she is a very traditional girl and she lives with her family. After we got back together, I felt that our relationship wasn't what it used to be, and I often felt neglected by her. She would spend a lot of time texting even when we are FaceTiming at night. She told me she texting her girl friends and I believed her. I went to celebrate the holidays with her family this winter break, and she was on her phone a bunch as usual. But I noticed that she wouldn't let me look at her phone and acting suspicious a lot of the time. She also told me she's going on a ski trip with a guy friend in March, but dodged questions when I asked for details of the guy. Finally, I've had it and looked through her FB messages, and I found conversations of her flirting with another guy for the past months. I confronted her about my findings and she admitted to having a crush on the other guy for months but nothing happened... just flirting on the internet. Plus the guy did not quite reciprocate the feelings. But upon further questioning, she told me that she actually met up with that guy two weeks ago when she came to my city to visit me (the guy lives in the state I am going to graduate school in). She told me that they only kissed that night. I asked her to show me her texts and FB messages, but she refused for several hours before letting me look through them. I found out that she's been texting and flirting with him the whole time we've been spending the holidays together, and she changed his name to a female name so I wouldn't be suspicious. She also didn't tell him that we were a couple again and still refers to me as her Ex. She was apologetic when I confronted her and I made her cancel the ski trip and cease communication with him. She reassured me that nothing will happen since he lives in my state far away from her and that he's not interested in a relationship anyway.

I feel so hurt right now and can't fall asleep. She's my first girlfriend and I love her so much. Her family treats me like another son. But the logical side of me knows that I cannot trust her anymore. I have to stay with her until Saturday and I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR long term, currently long distance girlfriend flirted with another guy via texts and FB for months even during the holidays when I'm visiting her. She met with him once when she came to my city to visit me and they kissed.

Update:
Thanks for all of the supportive comments and thank you for those that shared their similar experiences. Maybe I'm an idiot for missing all of the red flags, but hope is a helluva drug. We talked again this morning and decided breaking up was the best thing to do. It was an amicable breakup and we talked about what went right and what went wrong in our relationship (other than the part where she cheated on me). She pretty much said she didn't feel appreciated by me, and she lost her feelings for me after our initial breakup. We both agreed that she was wrong and that she should've broken up with me properly before trying to start a new relationship. She feels ashamed of what she did. I will still stay until Saturday because flight tickets are crazy expensive right now and not economically feasible for me to fly home. But we will definitely be breaking up after this incident. Being separated by thousands of miles and a jam packed curriculum from school will hopefully make this break up a bit easier. Thank you everybody for your input. ",relationship_advice
My husband has sex with me while I sleep wth?,"Ive been married 5 years,  the sex is good and usually regular (providing we're not fighting) but my husband has been having sex with me while I'm asleep. I know it sounds crazy! Im a very heavy sleeper and he's taking advantage of it. On a few occasions I've awoke to him fingering me and about to put it in, if he knows I'm waking up, he stops. I am all for being woke up for sex but what is driving me crazy is that he stops every time and pretends like he isn't doing anything. I hate sleeping in clothes, I'm a naked sleeper but I don't think that is an open invitation right?

 Last weekend, I woke up again to him trying to get his dick in me, he froze until I acted like I was still asleep, I wanted to see how far this was going to go.  I pretended to sleep and wake up 3 different times, everytime I ""woke up"" he pulled out, heart racing and held me in position real tight until I fell back asleep,  finally he finished all over me and went to get up to get a towel and I said.... was that good for you? HE TRIED TO ACT LIKE HE WAS ASLEEP!!! I told him I was awake the whole time and asked why he did that and why he thought it was okay. His answer...I was horny, it wont happen again. 

Fast forward a week...I haven't been talking to him all week. I go to bed with clothes on all week because the thought of him doing it again just disgust me. I confront him about it, he acts like it's no big deal, I'm his wife so it should be fine, he wouldn't care if I did that to him and when I asked why he stopped when I woke up he says because he knew I'd be mad, he didnt want to get caught. I am trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. I'm pretty open minded, if it was a fettish or something, maybe I could be ok with it but he will not give me anything. 

At this point in feel like I can't trust  him anymore and I don't know what to do. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? Do you think I should believe him? He is only admitting to doing it this 1 time even though I've told him I've caught him before.

AITA for wanting to abort my late husband's baby?,"My husband died a week ago and I'm 13 weeks pregnant. My in-laws know and they want me to keep the baby so there's a piece of him alive. When I mentioned I might get an abortion they flipped out on me, called me every name in the book and selfish, at which point I broke down in tears and left.

I don't know what to do. On one hand I can understand what they mean, if I abort there's nothing of my husband left. But I just... Don't know. I can end this chapter of my life and move on. I don't know what to do. I know a lot of you are thinking it's amazing I'm pregnant and I can always have a piece of him through my baby but that's the thing, I can't decide if I want that or not. I've never been more conflicted in my life and I have to stop thinking about it so I don't miscarry from the stress.

Edit: I don't know how many people will see this but I want to thank everyone who offered support and shared their stories with me via PM, I'm truly moved. I'm still undecided on what to do moving forward but I I'll try and find someone to talk to. Some more context if anyone's wondering:

*  My husband died by suicide because he was too stressed out about his career. No one really saw it coming.
*  I don't have any children, or family. My sister is the only one I know and she's on the other coast. I'm 25.
*  I don't know if I'm going to abort, however *if* I do carry the baby full term, I'd rather take care of it myself and not give it up for adoption.
*  I'm in New York which has some of the toughest grandparent rights laws which further complicates things. I'm afraid of giving birth then having custody taking away from me.
*  My financial situation is... okay. I can support my baby and I if I budget down.
*  My relationship with my in-laws was never friendly. They didn't approve of me and despite trying to warm relations with them they never reciprocated.
*  Some people are questioning why I'm trying to move on so fast and saying I'm awful for it: The baby is growing and I can't hit pause. I need to make up my mind sooner than later.

  My mind still isn't made up and likely won't be soon. I'll take some time off to think and talk to someone about this situation. Also to the very colorful PM's telling me to kill myself, go fuck yourself. Thank you.

I know that there's no way they can actually bleed like they do in these games, but it gets me wondering; if someone had unusually high blood pressure, and was wounded, would the blood spurt/shoot out of their body much faster and at a higher angle than normal?

Dying of a mysterious lung disease; military hospital is putting me on months-long waiting lists just to see my PCM for referrals and preventing me from going to civilian doctors.,"Title is TL;DR.

Went on a deployment to Guam and contracted something that's killed my pulmonary health: It hurts to breathe, I occasionally cough up blood either after waking up or exercising, I can't even go up a flight of stairs or walk for more than 20 minutes without turning into a dying fish gulping air. I was given an albuterol inhaler and that's it medication-wise.

Was screened for cancer and TB, both results came back negative, was unable  to get further testing done in Guam due to lack of accommodations at their hospital, am currently back in mainland US but the Navy's making it a fight to even see my primary doctor just to *get a referral* to see a cardiologist, radiologist and pulmonologist for follow-up testing. 

Every day I'm getting worse and I've been told I'm straight-up not allowed to go to a hospital or doctor outside of the military to get help, lest I face punitive measures in addition to having to pay out of pocket. 

What can I do? Who can I talk to? I've basically been told: unless you're actually on your deathbed, you're screwed. I'm trapped in endless diagnostics, recieving no actual care, operating at the speed of bureaucracy and I'm slowly dying.

EDIT: Went to the ER, complained  about the chest pain, worked like a charm. I've got a follow up appointment tomorrow and got all the referrals needed to book appointments at all the specialty clinics.

EDIT 2: I appreciate all the advice and good will. 

For the guys PMing medical advice: it's not pneumonia or bronchitis or anything acute: was screened for those as well, symptoms have been ongoing for almost a year now from onset of symptoms. It's also only a *little* blood, like  the amount you'd get from a paper cut. Still sucks and it's pretty alarming when it happens.

EDIT 3: Didn't expect the post to blow up like it did; I appreciate the support guys.

Given the sheer amount of people recommending the same thing, I'll address it here instead of individually: 

I'll be following up with either patient advocacy services for further appointments and bring up the difficulty I've been having with my CoC.

I'll bring up parasites as a potential source of my issues given the symptoms I posted, symptoms I didn't mention, vectors for infection (I had a LOT of sashimi/sushi there) and lack of key symptoms of other 'common' lung diseases were a near perfect match. Should be as simple as a sputum/stool sample and bloodwork for the yea or nay on that. I'll see you dudes on season 7 of *Monsters Inside Me*.

"AITA for not letting my wife have mothers day after she ""canceled"" fathers day?","So, this is a little strange of a situation but hear me out.

&#x200B;

I've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. I love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. She is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  I will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). One of her big beliefs though is with holidays. She still celebrates holidays with the family (Christmas, Easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the ""Money"" side of things. We're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for Christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.

Last year in June my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. Her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. I was a little hesitant but I agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.

Well, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. All of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. I obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. All of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. She's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. We fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.

"Am I supposed to go along with the ""fake"" reason I'm being bootycalled for?","Hi there,

Some girl I've been ""flirting"" with just asked me through facebook to come to her place and make her pancakes. 

It was a casual ""flirty"" conversation about crepes and pancakes that ended with that question.

I've heard through a mutual friend that she just broke up with her boyfriend. Oh and by the way she invited me to a party where she will be the only person a I know. At her place. So.

My question is really stupid but... if she calls me to ask me to come to her place... let's say... tommorow. Am I exptected to bring flour, eggs and shit to make pancakes? Or is it pretentious to go there with nothing? 

What do you think?

EDIT : SHE ASKED ME TO COME OVER TONIGHT. I NEED QUICK ANSWERS.

CRITICAL UPDATE : 

Guys wait, I'm back already. I have been scammed.

It was an actual pancake party.

I got to her frontdoor, ready to knock, when I noticed noise in the background. I thought to myself that it was the wrong place but no. ""app. 122, 9th floor"". I knocked.

She opens the door (she's really hot) and welcome me with a joint (nice). As I take a puff on it, she leads me to the living room.

5 peoples sitting around a table, with pancakes, alcohol, weed and stuffs. I dont know a single one of them. I say '""hi"" to everyone then take a sit. She sits right next to me, and instantly starts to flirt with me in front of those people.

As she puts her hand one my thigh, I realized I smoked weed and I also remember that I'm not a social smoker. Like, I smoke weed when alone or with friends and I'm good, but around people I dont know + a hot girl I'd like to fuck, I get paranoid and really anxious.

I realize that this was not what I signed for and that it was fair for me to awkwardly get the fuck out of here.

At this moment, one of her friend tells her ""randomfriend1 and randomfriend2 are on the way"" to which she respond with ""Oh ok, are randomfriend3 and randomfriend4 still coming?"" ""yeah!""

She then asked me if I wanted to go to the club with them (something like ~10 people I have never seen in my life). I told them no, and that I just meant to drop by, nothing more.

I'm home now. Dont worry I'm safe.

IMPORTANT EDIT : 

Hey guys, y'all need to chill.

I didnt blow anything or missed any opportunities. I absolutely dont want to date this girl. I barely know her and she just broke up with her boyfriend of 2-3 years and I dont want to date her or be her rebound or anything.

I thought that this was a booty call and since she is hot I was down for it. I was not down to attend a pancake party + nightclub with a group of people i dont know. On a fucking monday night. For a girl I dont give a damn about.

I was perfectly aware that she was flirting with me, thanks. I'm a little bit socially awkward but I'm not a robot. 

If she asks, I plan on being honest with her and tell her the truth even if that makes me sound like a loser. If she wants more than just casual sex I'm out. I dont need to meet her friends or attend her pancakes parties (unless if by ""pancakes"" she mean ""~~my~~ her butt"" and by ""party"" she mean ""just the two of us"")*

* edit : wording

FINAL EDIT : 

Ok well what started as an innocent r/nostupidquestions thread ended in a very boring r/relationships thread and I dont wanted that. I gave updates to the people who asked it because I thought that was a funny story, and gave some hints here and there about the context.

Now everyone is yelling at me that I'm a nerd for not dating her. 

So I'm tired to explain myself, it was fun while it lasted, I'm out.

TL;DR : Thought I was invited to some ""pancakes & chill"" but got bamboozled into an actual pancake party. I got awkward and left. 

8 months later update for those who landed on this thread by accident : We were drunk as fuck at a party last week and she told me that it was indeed a booty call, but she was as awkward as me so she threw this whole pancake party at the last minute to get me to come thinking it would only last like half an hour. She called her friend to come, and that friend came and invited other friends, etc etc. 

It got out of her control and she perfectly understood why I left. After that she felt too awkward to pursue me again. I told her that she could pursue me now ... but she now has a new boyfriend.",NoStupidQuestions

Tifu by loudly telling a female workmate I was going to finger her,"So I (M 22) work in a factory that is slightly short staffed, so from time to time some of the office staff have to come through to the factory and help out. One of these office workers is a (F 18) who we'll call Jess. So Jess was in the factory helping out and I happened to walk past her wearing some rubber gloves. Now Jess and I have a friendly bit of banter from time to time, and so as I was passing her she looked at my gloves and said 

""You look like you're about to go finger a cow""
(Which is a bit of a weird thing to say, but hey ho) 

So me being the master of wit that I am instantly thought ""right, now's my time to shine! If I say the right thing I could turn this into a funny insult and call her a cow""
My brain decided malfunction and what actually came out was

""I'll finger you""

Not surprisingly this immediately drew a funny look from her and i felt my face start to glow red from awkwardness...
Because of the level of noise I  the factory I have sort of developed a loud voice in order to be heard. It just so happened that one of the machines cut out at almost the same moment and the factory went *relatively* quiet. Everybody in the immediate vicinity heard and looked over at me...
At this point I wanted to just crawl into a hole, but I stood my ground and tried explaining myself

""I meant that as though you're a cow, not that I actually want to finger you""

This seemed to clear things up for her but now everyone at work keeps making fingering puns and innuendo's. 
I can't look Jess in the eye any more. Works gonna be a little awkward for a while...

Tl/Dr:  female workmate said I looked like I was going to go ""finger a cow"" so as my attempt a a witty response I said ""I'll finger you."" Now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references

TIFU by fucking my dads couch,"Throwaway, because I don't want to become a notorious couch fucker on reddit.

This happened last week on Saturday, because Saturday and Sunday is my father's custody time for me. Saturday is also my dad's day off from his steel delivery job, but it all started when my dad got ""called into work"" for a few hours because some guy had called off sick and he had to fill for him.

This made me think about all the possible (private) things I could do to anything around the house. Then I saw; **the $700 LEATHER COUCH**. I executed my plan. 
Materials needed: Dish soap, a couch, and rags

I started with the dish soap, applying it to the creases within the leather couch. Then, I put rags under the area of attack to prevent drippage. Then, the couch bestiality commenced. Lemme tell ya, it was pretty fuckin good for the about amount of virgin I am, and there was no turning back. 

Another detail about my dad getting called into work is that I was inside the couch about 2-3 hours after he left. On a usual workday, he gets off at 3:30, but arrives home at 4. 

Not today

He left at 9:30 am for work, and I was doing the dirty at like 12 pm, which I felt was an appropriate time because he supposedly wasn't supposed to come home for another 3-4 hours. Then it **happened**. The couch is about 10 feet from the front door, and within eyesight

[here](https://imgur.com/wi2nz1Q) is a very crude drawing of the living room.

I heard the deadbolt jiggling and my heart went down my throat. The knob turns, and the door opens to reveal a butt ass naked me, balls deep in his very expensive and luxury couch. He gave me a stare that could kill 20 men and mouthed the words ""what the fuck are you doing"". I couldn't decide what to do, so I just put my clothes on and started cleaning right there with the rags I stuffed in the couch, while saying very quietly ""sorry^sorry^sorry"". He walked back out but before he shut the door, he said ""don't clean that; im throwing it away, now."". The rest of the day was extremely awkward: couch behind us while we sat on table chairs, while we watched tv and not saying anything to each other.

TL;DR: Fucked my dads couch with some soap and he came home earlier than expected 

EDIT: Typo

EDIT NO.2: HOLY SHIT YALL BLEW THIS UP.
I really, really, REALLY appreciate the gold; regardless if this is a throwaway or not. My couch fucking earned me a dollar and I'm proud!",tifu
TIFU by wearing the wrong underwear to my kids field trip.,"Everything is in the TL;DR.


This happened yesterday but I'm feeling the repercussions today. 

It started with me getting dressed and just throwing on lace underwear vs cotton. I was just staying home all day so it wasn't a big deal because after my kid leaves for school I walk around naked anyways. 

My kid reminds me that I have volunteered for his field trip and here's a list of kids that I would be watching. 

I forgot so... Shit! I don't have a lunch for him or I so I threw jeans on to go run to get a lunch. I figured I could change when I got back no biggie. However... My husband text me asking for me to get some things from the store that had to be picked up immediately. 

I had no time to change and made it to the field trip 10 min late. Fine, it's fine. I'll be ok. It's 75degrees, I'm in jeans, lace undies, vagina freshly shaved from the night before. I didn't think much of it. 

There's a lot of walking on this field trip though. I'm keeping up with the 8-9 year olds and I feel my underwear pull up between the lips of my vagina. So half my vagina is rubbing the lace and jeans while I walk. 

I can't fix it at any point and at this age I couldn't just adjust and lie about tucking in my shirt etc. This is the age boobs and ""lady parts"" are a big deal. 

*i did adjust at one point but my lady meat just fell out right away. 

So for three hours my vagina is rubbing against uncomfortable fabric. It's hot so my natural discharge and sweat are making it worse. I can't adjust because the bathrooms are too far away for me to leave the kids and NONE of the little terds had to go! 

I got home and half my vagina was rubbed raw. My husband said it looked swollen or like a big ingrown hair was forming. 

Tl;dr- I shaved my vagina so had no hair buffer when my lady meat fell out of lace undies and chaffed during a three hour walk-a-thon field trip. My vagina lips are swollen and it hurts to be a functioning human.",tifu

"TIFU by sending my son to school in his pajamas because I had misread ""Pi Day"" as ""Pj Day"" in a school email.","Let's start off by saying I'm a single dad and my son is in kindergarten. His teacher sent out a message yesterday that said ""Tomorrow for Pi day we have a parent bringing in a snack."" I had only glanced at it. Ten minutes later, I got a message from my son's mom asking if I have a matching set of Pjs for him to wear. I replied yes, and then never looked at the teacher's email again.  

Fast forward to this morning, and I dress my boy in his favorite Pjs and take him to school. As I approach, I notice that no one else is wearing Pjs and my son is trotting around in bright red spider man pajama pants. So I get him to the door of the school, send him in, and immediately pull my phone out to look at the email. I had to read it twice before I noticed that it didn't say ""Pj Day"" at all, but fucking ""Pi Day!"" 

So I sent an email to his teacher explaining the mix up and asked her to make him feel comfortable today. She said she glossed it over with the other kids and made it a non issue. Luckily, they are only 5-year-olds in kindergarten with little self awareness. 

So sorry, son! Here's a little lesson on being different!!

TL;DR - Sent my son to school in his pajamas because I had misread ""Pi Day"" as ""Pj Day"" in a school email. His teacher made it a non issue in class and it didn't scar my son for life, hopefully. 



UPDATE: His mom picked him up and said that he immediately asked to call me to let me know that today was not pajama day.  He said that his teacher let him slide because he had enough classroom points, but he knows that it wasn't Pj day. Lol. His mom took part of the blame. Thank goodness he's so young. This would not have worked out as well in first or second grade. 

Edit: Wow! My first gold and silver. Thanks everyone!! I'm glad you enjoyed my story. 

Edit 2: Sorry for my choice of wording. But let me clarify that there wasn't any blame or consequence by the teacher.  I was self blaming, if anything. The teacher just used the classroom points as a hollow excuse to lighten any ridicule or confrontation from the other kids. I think she was just trying to bring it forward in a positive light and then get past it and move on. No blame or consequence. Just the teacher spreading sugar and me feeling like an ass. ",tifu

AITA for sending a Tinder asshole to McDonald's?,"I'm using an alt for obvious reasons. 

For backstory, I'm female and live in the U.S. I'm on dating apps and I'm finding that a lot of guys are just disrespectful. Some of them are polite and want to start an actual conversation, but a lot, maybe even the majority, are just ridiculous.

A lot of the messages I get are ""wanna fuck?"" or ""what are you looking for?"" which is their way of indirectly saying ""I want sex with minimal effort"". I even have in my profile that I don't do random hookups, but I think I overestimated how often people actually read the profiles.

After having this happen a dozen times, I finally snap. A guy on Tinder messages me and the conversation seems to be going okay at first. We message back and forth and then I don't hear a response. That's okay, people get busy. 

At around 11:30 pm he hits me with the ""Sorry, I got busy. What are you up to? Wanna have some fun?"" During our initial conversation I make it crystal clear, I'm not looking for hookups. I don't to casual sex. So I remind him of this, and he starts negging me. ""I knew you'd be a prude"", ""not sure why you wasted my time"", ""let's just meet up at my house and talk and see where things go."" 

Finally I was like, ""okay, but come to my house."" and then I proceed to give him the address of a McDonald's. In the next town over. I waited for him to get close to the location, he confirmed that he was about 5 mins away, and I unmatched him.

I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.,"Throwaway, because reasons.

TL;DR: Found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. Asked girlfriend about it. She started yelling at me and crying and left.

I don't even know where to start with this. I'm dumbfounded. She just stormed out the house and I'm sitting on the bed asking myself A LOT of questions.

I live a pretty normal life, and I thought so did my girlfriend. We've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. We started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. She would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. I'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. I always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, I wouldn't stop her.

This is where it takes a turn for the weird. I keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. I also go to the gym frequently, so I always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. I never kept count, but I know by just a visual glance I several pairs. This morning when I went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, I noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. Again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. I went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so I checked the washing machine and dryer. Both were empty. I couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. So, I did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. After all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. She went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. When I went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. I told her I wasn't mad, I was just looking for my socks. She kinda mumbled ""I'll don't know."" I still wasn't mad, of course, but I was super confused. Socks just don't disappear. So I asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""I'll buy you new ones!""

The first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. I thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so I joked with her about ruining my socks. Wrong. Thing. To. Say. She started immediately crying. Like, full on sobbing. At this point I don't care about the socks anymore, I want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. I sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. She just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. I tried assuring her again it was okay. Even went so far as to say I would buy new socks and she didn't have to. I sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. I told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

On my way out I grabbed the garbage to take outside. When I got outside I lifted the lid off the garbage can and I noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. I could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. Since I was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, I wanted to see for myself. I opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. There, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. As soon as the smell hit me I knew it WAS POOP.

1. We don't own any pets.
2. We don't have any kids.
3. WHOSE POOP WAS ON MY SOCKS?

Work could wait. I couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. I grabbed the bag and walked back inside. As soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. She said I shouldn't be going through the garbage and that I was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. I asked her to calm down and that I just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. I wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. That's when it clicked. I don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. I asked her ""Is this your poop?"" She started sobbing again and ran out of the house. I didn't go after her this time.

So, now I am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. The only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. Which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. I sent her text asking her to come back. She hasn't responded yet. I don't even know what I'm going to say when (IF) she gets back.

UPDATE:

I had to leave for work and am now at work. Yes, I threw away the bag of poopy socks. She texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. She said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to NOT bring it up in person. I'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as I can. Her responses are super short, but I'm getting the idea.

I flat out asked her if it was a fetish. It is not a fetish. She confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. I found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. I had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? She thought I would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. She admitted she has done this for a long time. Her reasoning, as best as I can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in ANY WAY. She uses socks because it covers her entire hand. After she's done with them, she throws them away. She used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

So, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. It could be worse, I guess. I hope we can laugh about this later. I'm trying to find the humor in it now, but I'm still weirded out.

Found cash in my walls. It's mine right? Can I deposit them in the bank & pay back my student loans? (Washington),"Washington state.

I inherited a house from my uncle 3 years ago and by accident (trying to pass a cable there) I found a stack of cash hidden in the wall. I bought a stud finder and looked through all walls today and found about $100,000 cash, and a VHS cassette. They were all packaged in sealed very strong and thick plastic bags.

I ordered a VHS player for my computer already to see what's on the tape. But my question is whether I can take this cash to my bank and deposit them without raising suspicions?

Update: Caught SO (25M) with my (22F) best friend (23F),"Thank you for everyone who commented saying to cut them both off my life. It made me see that this is not how a best friend and boyfriend would act. 

Just a little update:

My (ex)friend reached out to me and told me that she thinks my boyfriend and I aren't compatible, and that our relationship probably won't last. This really pissed me off. I told her that I saw them that night. She was upset and kept apologizing, insisted that it was a mistake (stuff like that) I told her I didn't want to talk and that was that. I then confronted my (ex)boyfriend and he confessed that they have hooked up before. 

I have since blocked them both. I feel so hurt and I'm not sure when I'm going to feel okay again

TIFU getting high before dinner with my girlfriend's parents,"I was at my girlfriends parents house about to eat dinner, her mom had a big spread made up for build-your-own-tacos.

Now at this dinner I was unbelievably baked out of my fucking mind. I mean I smoked a lot of damn weed with my roommate before leaving because my nerves were getting to me since this was my first time meeting her parents.

So fast forward a bit and we're all making our plates, and I go last because I'm trying to be respectful.

I make my plate with a few tacos and think no big deal, just gonna finish up here and go sit down with the others.

Now when I sat down I noticed something was different about everyone. My girlfriend was trying to contain laughter while her parents had the most confused faces I've ever seen.

To try and break the ice I ask ""what happened?"" My girlfriend looks over at me and asks if I'm feeling okay whilst containing her laughter. Then she looks down at my plate to get me to see what I'd done.

And my god you guys, the fucking embarrassment.

I put Spanish rice full to the brim in my taco shells and I had the meat and other toppings scattered on the side in a mess on my plate. I was backwards in what I was trying to do but was too high to notice.

I didn't make a very good first impression because to this day they think I'm some kind of lunatic.

HOA insists my sister and I are not a single-family household and one of us should move out. We've lived here all our lives.,"I'm 21 and my sister is 19. We've lived in this house our entire lives. Our parents bought this house 27 years ago. They joined the HOA about 15 years ago.

My dad died 5 years ago, mom died 6 months ago. We are now the owners of this house.

We've been visited by the HOA multiple times, they're citing that we're not a single-family home anymore since our mom has died. They've told us that according to the terms, only a single family can be resident in the homes and being single family is defined as a person or couple and their legal unmarried children. This meant that my mom could live with me and my sister as it was a single family according to the definition, but me and my sister living here after our mom's death means we are two families of single adults. They want one of us to move out so that this place becomes a single family home again.

They've visited us FOUR times now asking us to leave. They say they don't like to sue our of respect for our parents but they will do that if we continue to refuse to comply by the community rules.

Can they kick one of us out of our own house? What should we expect and how can we fight this?

TIFU by ruining my promotion and having to quit my job out of shame,"So I work, or rather used to work, for the Eastern European branch of a Dutch company. This was my first and only job for the last 4 years. I've invested all of my time and effort in this job, and eventually it did paid off, when at the beginning of the year the regional manager informed me they were planning to make me a team leader. This would have meant, that in addition to a 35% salary increase off the bat, I would also get a percentage of the profits my team made, which could have meant anywhere between 3 and 5 times my salary. I was about to become rich and nothing would stop me. I passed all the examinations, all the interviews, and for the past 6 months I've been doing overtime like there was no tomorrow.

There was just one last step: I would have to do a presentation of my achievements and my vision for the future of the company in front of the man himself - the CEO of the company. My boss assured me this was more or less a formality and basically no one who was ever proposed for this promotion failed at this final step.

This should have taken place today, at 9 a.m. Tomorrow, I should have been in the HR office, signing my new contract. Instead, tomorrow I will be signing my resignation. How did this happen? Well, being the loud mouth that I am, I basically bragged to everyone I know that I was about to become a boss. Yesterday evening, I wake up with three of my former college mates, with sever six-packs of beer and a generous amount of weed. Something inside of me was screaming this wasn't a good idea, but the other side was saying, hey it's okay to celebrate, you deserve it. I initially said I would only drink one beer and take a couple off puffs from a joint, but of course, at 4 a.m. I was still awake and smashed.

I went to sleep, set my alarm for 7 a.m. and it did wake me up, but of course, being still very much smashed, I said just another ten minutes. I close my eyes, and after what didn't feel like more than 5 minutes, I wake up again, this time feeling better, but I could tell something was not right. I look at my phone, it's 9:30 a.m. and 5 missed calls. An intense feeling of panic hits me, I go straight into the shower, cursing non stop. I barely wipe myself, get dressed, make a dash for my car, drive like a mad man, passing several red lights (one of which I know for sure has red light camera), reach work in record time (7 minutes, it normally takes me at least 20).

When I got there, I went straight for the conference room, which, unsurprisingly, was empty. I go for the office, and just as I was about to go in, one of the team leaders comes out. It happened to be exactly the guy I never got along with. He instantly gets a grin on his face and says, as loudly as possible, ""oh boy, look who's here, buddy you're in big trouble, go inside"". I get inside, I see my team leader working on his computer, the CEO is nowhere in sight. He throws me a look of utter disgust, one I've never seen before, and tells me ""take a seat, don't turn on your computer, we will go talk"". Now the entire office just looks at me like I've murdered someone, no one dares say a single word. After what felt like an eternity, my team leader gets up from his seat and without saying a single word, signals me to follow him.

We go into the conference room. As soon as he closes the door, he goes into the most violent rage ever, screaming at me for what felt like hours, at one point I even felt like he was about to beat the shit out of me. Eventually, he did calm down, and told me - ""look, I'm not going to fire you, because you are the most competent guy on my team, but you have to understand that it's gonna take years, maybe even a new CEO, before you can be considered for this position again"". A moment of silence followed as I gathered myself back together and considered my options, when I eventually said ""Look, I'm sorry, I know I fucked up badly and I can't go on like this. I quit"". His last words were ""look, in other circumstances, I would have persuaded you to stay, and even now, if I could somehow get you out of this, I would, but it's beyond me now. If you wanna quit, I can't stop you. Good luck."" He then shook my hand and left. Now, I'm at the local McDonald's, already blew through half a pack of cigarettes while writing this post. I'm just thinking about how I managed to ruin 4 years of hard work just by being an idiot one night.

TIFU by not cleaning up after a LAN party,"So this happened about a month ago and I'm writing this now because I had a nightmare about it last night.  


I invited 3 of my buddies over to my house for a LAN party, and I prepared for it with tons of snacks and alcohol. I even went and bought a different friend's old Xbox One off him just so I could stop feeling left out (I was a PC and PS4 person beforehand with no one to play with :[ ). The night went extremely well, and in fact, it was one of the best nights I've had in a while. We stayed up all night drinking and playing Monster Hunter, PuBG, and Fortnite in my basement where I have a man cave set up.  


Now, I am NOT a drinker. I probably drink a beer about once a month when I'm super bored. My friends always joke about it by asking me if the beer in my fridge is the beer they brought over a month ago (it is, but I don't admit it lol). So when I woke up that next morning, I awoke with the biggest hangover I've ever had. I essentially slept through that entire next day on my couch. The thought of cleaning up the beer, liquor, and soda bottles, along with all the chips, dip, and salsa strewn around me didn't even cross my mind, let alone getting off the couch. I just locked the basement door that day (so my SO, Mary, didn't see the tornado wreck in there) and tried sleeping off my hangover. I figured I would clean it up the next day and no harm would be done.   


Well, actually, a few days go by and I go down into the basement to clean up. To my surprise, I found the door unlocked and slightly ajar. I just figured that I had forgot to lock the door. I was hungover after all and Mary would have said something if it was her. While I'm cleaning, I noticed that my gaming desk was surprisingly clean, which wasn't right because I had definitely spilled crumbs and alcohol all over it two days ago. I credited my dog Rex for the cleanup of my desk and just continued cleaning. After finally finishing, I sat down at my gaming desk and prepared to hunt some beasts with a buddy on Monster Hunter. To my surprise, however, my Xbox wouldn't turn on! I tried plugging it into a different wall outlet but it still refused to turn on. I tried turning on my Xbox manually by pressing the button on it instead of using the controller, but again, it didn't work. Then, I noticed that the power brick had no light on. ""Well at least I narrowed the problem down to the power block."" I thought to myself as I grabbed the block and unhooked it from the Xbox and outlet. That was my biggest mistake. Right as I unhooked the block from the wall, I felt a burning sensation all over my hand. When I looked down, I saw the most horrifying sight of my entire life.  


ANTS! ANTS!! ANTS!!!! Hundreds, thousands of tiny ants were pouring out of the power brick! So many, in fact, that I couldn't even see the brick. On top of that, I could barely see my fingers. I was holding it in a cradle fashion so the brick was touching my stomach/chest area as well. Ants were swarming my hands, arms, chest, and pants at this point! As soon as I realized what was happening, I literally jumped up in the air (dropping the block of course, scattering at least 1000 more ants all across the floor) while shouting ""JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!!"" I shook my hand hard while using the other to swipe off as many as I could. Then, still screaming and swearing at the top of my lungs, I proceeded to literally rip off my clothes while simultaneously running up the stairs. Mary and Rex had just run over to the top of the basement stairs when they saw me screaming, running, and tearing my clothes off. I ran up those stairs so fast and I plowed right through them as they both let out little yelps as they fell down on opposite sides of me. I proceeded into the garage and grabbed the bug spray. It said it was for flying insects but I figured it would work anyways, and thank God it did. I sprayed my arms and brushed off the last remaining ants. I stood there, catching my breath and watched the remaining ants as they shriveled up and died. I was furious. I always got and hated the feeling of something crawling on my skin when watching insect documentaries and such but this time, it was real. And they killed my Xbox. Now, I was going to kill them all. As I went inside with the can of bug spray and a rubber mallet in hand, I heard a scream at the top of the basement stairs and then proceeded to get plowed over by Mary and Rex (guess I deserved that). She ran upstairs into our bedroom with Rex in her arms and hid in there with him for the next few hours. I got back up and proceeded to spray my pants which where lying on the basement stairs and then went into the basement to unleash vengeance. I moved slowly inward determined not to miss a single ant. I smashed all the stragglers with the mallet before moving on to their base of operations, my Xbox power brick. It was still COMPLETELY covered in those tiny motherfuckers. Even around it, a carpet of ants ran around looking for whatever had disturbed them. It was here that I unleashed my weapon of mass destruction upon them until the supply was all but empty. The ones outside the block got blown away as they got hit by the gas of death, but I didn't care. I was going to insect bomb the whole house no matter what and then deep clean the place afterwards. I watched as the ones inside the block came crawling out before curling up and dying. Vengeance was so very sweet at that moment.  


A few hours later, I washed out the remaining dead and dying ants with purified water at the sink and watched with a grin as their lifeless bodies spiralled into the drain. After drying the block I decided to try and see if it worked because why not? And to my surprise, my Xbox booted right up! It was a small victory during that horrifying experience but one that I gladly took. The only bad part was, my left hand was bitten to shit and I couldn't play anyway. Plus, the feeling of ants crawling on my skin was ever present for the next few days. Even today, while writing this book, I've had to swipe across all parts of my body because I keep feeling those little shits all over me.  

EDIT: Formatting, gave name to SO.  


EDIT 2: Wow this blew up! Thank you for the support, tips, and taking the time to read through my harrowing story! I left out some details because I felt the story was long enough as it was, but due to popular demand, here is some more information:  


It's been over a month since the traumatic event. Right after making sure my Xbox was still working, I made absolutely sure that there were no more ants inside any of my devices on top of the table. My PC, PS4, Xbox, router, and monitors were all completely disassembled (I didn't find any signs of life within them). As for the power brick, I stripped the crap out of two screws so unfortunately, I was not able to clean it out thoroughly. Instead, I left the brick submerged in purified water for a couple of days to make sure that it anything living inside it would drown (more dead ants floating in the water the day after). I also bug bombed the entire house before we left for work about a week later. Both before and after, I did not see a single live ant anywhere in the house.  
As for the door, I still don't know how it got open but I've come to the conclusion that I had opened it sometime during the next day while I was still drunk/hungover.  

More formatting.

AITA for leaving my car profanely vandalized?,"A month ago, I parked in a spot on a public road (the street I live on) that someone had tried to save for themselves using a folding chair.

I went to the cops and it wasn't too hard to figure out what dumbass did it, a few neighbors knew who always put the chair out to save the spot, and figured it was them. A neighbors doorbell camera feed proved it. I got a $1200 settlement for the damages, and decided not to use it to fix my car because my car's a $2500 junker that I'm planning on replacing within the year anyway.

Last week I took a pregnancy test that came back positive, and yesterday morning I had a OBGYN visit to confirm. I was honestly ecstatic, I've always wanted to be a mom and my boyfriend felt the same, we talked about our future children many times even though we haven't been together for the longest time. I was really excited to tell him that night when he came over for dinner, but his reaction was... weird. His face went pale and he looked confused, not what I expected at all, and he got up to go to the bathroom. When he came back he was really calm and really serious, and he told me that he was really afraid and didn't know how me and our baby would factor into his life, and he made the decision to come clean. Not only is he nowhere near being divorced from his wife, who he's been with for close to a decade, but they have 2 kids together, 4 and 6. I have no idea how I never had even a clue, he works a lot and really early, which is the reason he would rarely spend nights over. That being said, it's not like he hardly spent any time with me. I'm heartbroken and confused and his confession left me with absolutely no idea what to do. I'm still pregnant, with his third child, and he's still very much married. He left right after that conversation, and I've called and texted but the only response I've gotten is that he'll speak to me tomorrow night after work. His demeanor is so cold and unfamiliar that I'm terrified he's going to leave me to figure out this pregnancy on my own. Another part of me doesn't want him anymore. If he's this good of a liar, what else has he lied about? What else COULD he lie about? I also would hate to break up a family like this. I feel disgusted in this whole situation, I've never felt more alone and confused. Should I be preemptive and leave him or are there other ways I could go about this?

Update: I think it's clear that I need to leave him, but that's about all that's clear for me right now. I want to be a mom, but these are the worst circumstances for that that I can imagine. I'm trying to think of ways to contact his wife and can't think of any. I do believe I was at the house where they once lived at one point, but he has moved since then (allegedly) so I have no idea what the new address is. I can't seem to piece this together at all. I don't understand how I was fooled for so long, I think I'm still in shock. To recap, I am leaving, I'm not sure if I want to abort, and as much as I want to tell his wife I have no way of doing that. I guess I'll wait until he speaks with me tomorrow. Thank you guys, if you'd like updates I'll keep posting.

UPDATE 2: I found his wife through a website someone sent me. He wasn't lying when he said he had no social media, but she does. Seeing the pictures of them made me realize I cannot keep our child, his family is beautiful and it breaks my heart to know he could do this to them, I cannot have the father of my child be someone like him. I still have no idea how to tell his wife.",relationship_advice

AITA for asking a fat lady to give up her seat to a late pregnant mother and her SO,"So I was on the bus yesterday and it was packed. But this lady was so big that none was able to sit next to her. Now I had a seat on the bus for a while but as a student I give up my seat to other people as thats my schools expectation. But the entire time i had been on the bus this lady had been sitting in a 2 person seat by herself. Now when I get on its already full with many people normally standing and it really got on my nerves that this lady had the audacity to take up 2 seats. But when a lady who was deep into her pregnancy and her SO got on the bus it really annoyed me. after 2 or o minutes and no one had offered them or her alone i worked up the strength to ask her if she would get up and give her seat to the couple.

&#x200B;

Thats where i stuffed up. So i asked her politely if she would give up her seat so the lady didn't have to suffer with the pregnancy as badly. (Something along the lines of ""Excuse me ma'm would you mind giving up your seat so the lady over there could sit down so its a less unpleasant experience for her, if you could i'm sure they would greatly appreciate it)

&#x200B;

Apparently this was super rude and she got really offended and started shouting that i was 'fatphobic' and rude and that she would report this slight to my schools headmaster and get me suspended or expelled.

&#x200B;

So reddit AITA.

&#x200B;

\[EDIT\]

\-ok then i'm an asshole it though what i was doing was good but it turns out she probably had justifiable reasons for the 2 seats.

TIFU by smoking a joint.,"So I'm literally writing this about 30 minutes after it happened,

So this morning I'm thinking I'm going to smoke a small joint before I go into work to deal some minor stress (dad just had a heart attack this morning) so I'm running late thanks to the awful choice to smoke a joint, as I realise I wasn't going to get to the train station in time I spent £10 on a taxi there,

So I get to the train station and buy my ticket (£6.80) and jump on the train ready to not be late for work!

So what happens? Because I'm so fucking baked I leave my ticket and the receipt on the train... get to the barriers and I can't find the bloody thing, at which point I ask an attendant if I'm able to re buy my ticket and he tells me ""yes but you're going to have to pay a £20 fine for traveling without a ticket as well"" as annoying as this is I can't do much but agree, so I pay, now my journey is at £33.60 so far, I then ask if I can have my ticket so I can return back from work later and I'm told ""no you will have to buy another one"" 

So after this costly shitstorm of a travel fare I get into work and explain my shitty morning to my manager and that I'm going to need to take tomorrow off to see my dad in hospital,

I then find out that I have booked today and tomorrow off about 2 weeks ago.

TIFU..

Got high, late for work, paid an expensive taxi, lost train ticket on train, got fined, had to buy a new one as well, didn't even have to be at work today, the journey totalled £40.40.",tifu

"TIFU by using my roommate's ""toy"" NSFW","My roommate and I are pretty close and have an open policy about going into each others' ""bedside drawers"" (need condoms, lube, etc.) As far as I know, neither of us has used this liberty until now. My roommate is out of town for a few weeks for a marathon and vacation and I am kind of lazy when it comes to certain things. 

Due to improper planning, I ran out of personal lubricant so I took a visit to my roommate's drawer to see if he had some. He did, as well as some other things. One of those things was what I can only describe as a [triple cock-ring] (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/3178JrK6a1L._SY355_.jpg) contraption.
For context, my roommate is a 6'2 black guy and I'm a 5'10 ginger. Naturally, I assumed that, if anything, this device would be too big for me. I was woefully wrong.

I was in the mood so I didn't think through the possible consequences of placing my most precious parts in this stainless steel death trap. Almost immediately after wriggling my naughty bits into this thing, I realized my horrible mistake. 

Within 30 seconds, my twig and berries transformed into a grotesque set of eggplant and plums. As with any bad situation, I figured my best way out was to power through. I took the aforementioned lube and went to town.

After what felt like a lifetime, I began to approach climax. For my trouble, I was hoping for an intensely pleasurable orgasm. Again, I was wrong. 

Instead of a powerful release, I was met with an intense pain in my perineum and nothing came out. This thing was so tight that there was NO ejaculate. I freaked out.

I figured once I got this nonsense torture device off my situation, things would resolve themselves but again, I was wrong.

The caricature emoji that was my junk, remained fully engorged.
I continued to freak out. I didn't want to go to the ER and have some firefighter saw this horrifying mistake off my adult parts, so I did the next logical thing. 

I filled a bowl with ice and water, dunked my bits and hoped for salvation. After 15 minutes, the swelling subsided to the point that I could manipulate the affected area out of the contraption.
After another 20 minutes of icing my genitals, I went to relieve myself and proceeded to pass, what I assumed to be, a frothy mixture of man milk and urine.

2/10 Do not try.

"Audio-recorded our daycare provider, found my son was strapped into his car seat the entire day.","This is in CA for legal purposes. I'll just get straight to it. Back in Nov 2017, my wife and I were looking for a daycare place for our (then) 4 months old son. We found this order lady who said she'd been doing this for awhile, and had since scaled back in recent years. She only took on infants, and only about 4 at a time. She was close by, had a playroom for the kids, a binder detailing their typical day, and a checklist of the items she needed daily from us (food, diapers, etc). All seemed well.

Skip to now, and for little reasons here and there, my wife and I had a conversation that something felt off about her. For peace of mind, we put an audio-recording device in his car-seat. We listened to it last night and, to say the least, not all is well.

From what we can gather, she leaves our son in his car seat all day long, only taking him out once to change him when he pooped. After dropping him off, he cried for maybe 30min straight, then just seemed to give up. For the next five or six hours, you just hear him blathering, or whimpering, or scratching the car seat. Sometimes he cries, until he gives up. It was difficult to listen to. In the background, you never hear her, just the TV and occasionally another baby crying.

Obviously, he's not back there today, nor will he be returning. We made up some excuse, telling her I'd be staying home with him all this week. We don't want to tip her off just yet, because there are other kids in her care. My question is, what can or should we do about her? Who do we report her to?",legaladvice

WIBTA for running off with my gf's daughter and dog?,"I've been with my girlfriend for nearly two years. I'm 48, she's 49, and she has a 19 year old daughter. I began living with them all pretty early on, only six months in.

I learned relatively quickly it's a rough household. My girlfriend is exceedingly controlling of her daughter. Not allowed out, not allowed to have a job, not allowed a cellphone. She doesn't protest because she can't go anywhere else. It's either live by mommy's rules or be homeless to be frank. There's no abuse other than mental/emotional, just so I'm clear. She's all peachy keen when my son (17) comes over, it's like she's a different person. She's a good ""stepmom"" to my son but an abysmal mother to her own.

I kind of took a passive approach to this. I didn't interfere because she's not my child. She wasn't too friendly with me early on but she's grown to like me enough to open up about these things. At this point two years in, we're very close. She even calls me ""dad"" which struck me as odd but she never had any father in her life, at least not this long.

I think the turning point for me was when we decided to bring a puppy into the home. I grew up with lapdogs who roamed free throughout the house, but she decided this dog would stay in a cage for 18-20 hours a day and only let out to eat and mess outside. Despite my protests and attempts to let her roam free, my girlfriend eventually put a key lock on her cage. We became very distant after this.

The daughter proposed to me that we all leave this relationship. She's an adult and wants to make this decision to flee her mother. She wanted my help because she can't otherwise. I was going to leave my girlfriend anyways over the treatment of the dog. I can afford a good 3bdr apartment, easy, so a +1 I think could be a good idea. This could also be her only way of escape. My plan was to have an apartment with my son and dog, but the addition of stepdaughter wouldn't hurt.

Am I the asshole for effectively stealing away my girlfriend's daughter to live with me?

TIFU by walking with my hands in my pockets.,"This didn't actually happen today, it happened very early yesterday morning. So, I had gone to a friend's house a few blocks away to hang out. Because they live so close, I walked over & planned on walking home. 

When my friend got tired, I packed up my backpack, put on my jacket and headed home. I was walking with my hands in my pockets because it was cold out. At the end of the block, I stepped off the curb to cross the street, and the next thing I remember is spitting out a mouthful blood & pieces of tooth. 

I had slipped on ice and, because my hands were in my pockets, I couldn't break my fall. I blacked out momentarily when I hit the ground, but I assume I landed on my face. My teeth punched a hole through my lip, and shards of tooth got stuck inside. 

Several hours in the ER later, I was patched up with 10 stitches (5 inside my mouth, 5 outside). They couldn't do anything about the tooth, other than put a protective layer on the broken surface. (It will have to be fixed this week when a dentist can see me.) 

TL;DR: Walked home from a friend's house with my hands in my pockets, slipped on a patch of ice, landed on my face, bit a hole through my lip.

In my last [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/clt0i3/tifu_by_sleeping_with_a_married_woman/), that blew up wayy beyond my expectations. A lot has happened since then. Aside from multiple messages, hate, getting a girl's phone number, and disbelief of that story... Let me tell ya folks, it is very, very real.

I was told that the husband came into the bar looking for a red headed guy with a beard named ""Jonathan"". So unless he reads the original post on the Reddits, I'm safe. I think.

Her car is finally gone. And I haven't heard anything from the husband directly, but this shit has gotten juicier.

I shared the post with a friend that I had lost touch with, because life and everything. And figured she'd get a kick out of this insanity. She asks what her name was. I tell her, and she was like ""OMG I WAS GUESSING THAT YOU WERE GONNA SAY ________"" Well then I ask for a picture, to confirm if it's the same girl.

WIBTA if I told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?,"So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we're hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven't seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what's been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the ""secrets"" I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying ""Just don't let mom find out"" The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out ""I cheated on my wife..."" At first it didn't register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife's travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They've both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) 
He told me life has been good to him now and he's just thankful things have finally worked out. 

As stated before I hate cheaters and I've always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it's the right thing to do, especially because I've known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it's none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don't want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don't say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?

TLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she's a close friend. WIBTA?

Local cop tells me not to walk up my own hill to home!(wv),Local pd were just here not long ago telling me that me walking home was an issue. Apparently I am scaring kids in the morning walking home from work. I have no other option when I am being dropped off by other means of transportation. I ask the cop as to what I should do. His response? Stay back tell the kids get on the bus and/or find another alternate route. There is just one route up and down. The cop then proceeds to tell me that unless I want an order of protection placed against me from their parents that I need to find another way! What do I do? I dont drive a car due to PTSD issues. I have a lot of mental health issues including hellish depression and anxiety. This is bogus. All I was doing was walking home! Help!,legaladvice
TIFU watching incest porn,"*Throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

This happened yesterday. I was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. I will state, for the record, I do not advocate incest. My girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. All I wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so I went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. That's all this was. Research. 

So, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. Of all people. If there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment I look straight into it. I answered the phone. The old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

Cut to my dad and I driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. Then, there came the silence. It wasn't the awkward kind. But I guess we just kinda said enough at the time. My father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. He was in the mood to get jiggy with Jeezy. But instead of hearing voices worshipping the OG upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital Q&A: 

*""You like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""Arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

My old man unknowingly activated the car's Bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever I was listening to last. In this case, it was fucking incest porn. Now, I never closed the video before I left the house, but I did pause the motherfucker. Yet, somehow, my phone went Skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

I frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what I do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

Dad: Suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids. 

Me: 

I immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home.

Spamming suicide hotline numbers at depressed people or suicidal people doesn't seem that helpful.,"You know the last thing I think most suicidal or depressed people want to hear is? You need to talk to someone. You should talk to a therapist. You should call this hotline. 

You think they haven't fucking thought of that? No shit. It's the first thing anyone says when someone is depressed; you should talk to a therapist.

Honestly? I don't think there's a way to measure it, but if someone calls that hotline I don't think they were going to do it anyways (other than the ones that called it and did it on the call).

It's just annoying to me that when people say they're depressed and society sucks, and they joke about (or are serious about) killing themselves, no one ever offers real solutions but just says ""call this random number and talk to someone, oh I just know how you feel I've been there before""


Edit: this seems split in terms of popularity. I'm gonna take this time to lay out what worked for me. Feel free to tell me I'm an idiot, but I swear to god this worked for me. You know what pulled me out of my slump? Realizing all of these other styles of help were bullshit, and that it was entirely my own mental state. If I was going to get out of it, I was going to have to be the one to make changes. At face value it sounds silly, but I really internalized this idea. I forced myself to stop relying on other people for my own happiness. It made me a more cynical person towards society as a whole, but damnit if it didn't help I don't know what did. Realizing society's shortcomings were what put me in that place to begin with made me understand that in order to overcome, I was going to be the only one that could truly change my own personal mental well being. I took this mentality to heart, and started focusing on things like hobbies. It wasn't easy, but I spent my time learning to do things like play guitar, or build circuits, or get really good at a certain video game, or produce beats, etc. This idea may be a crock of shit, but I gave this advice to another one of my depressed friends telling them I thought the advice people generally give is bullshit. I actually found that giving a bleak response of understanding and being real with them and not being all ""yeah, talk to someone!"" Etc. was more helpful. If you can actually relate to how that depressed person feels instead of just telling them everything will be okay, you have a better chance of helping. They don't want to hear ""everything is okay"", they want to hear ""yeah you're right everything really is fucked."" If you can truly relate to them and the way they feel without trying to tell them how to fix it explicitly, they'll appreciate it.

Edit 2: I should have been more explicit when I wrote this. I'm sure hotlines help some people, I'm not saying they don't. I'm also not saying therapy doesn't help people.

Edit 3: Here's an analogy. Your friend is in a hole (depression). You're standing outside of the hole. You're shouting phone numbers down into the hole and saying things like ""you're gonna be fine, it's okay"". In reality, it would be much more helpful if you could jump into the hole with them and show them the way out.

"My (20F) boyfriend (20M) invites my best friend (20F) out to games, just the two of them.","My boyfriend(lets call him J) and I have been together for a year and me and my best friend(lets call her G) have been friends since grade school. J and G are both varsity players and are addicted to watching sports. They would follow hockey, baseball, soccer, football, basketball, like almost any game they love. However, i'm not really a sports person but still I would make the effort to attend their games. I would also make an effort to learn and understand their games. J plays football and G plays soccer.

J was using my laptop and forgot to logout his facebook account. I know its wrong to snoop but I couldn't help it. Some his teammates were messaging him and I clicked on the message icon and saw that he was messaging G. I got curious and scrolled through it and saw that he invited G out to multiple games, saying that he will buy 2 tickets for this game or that game. G would decline and tell him that he should invite me. J then said that I wouldn't understand and that I was not fun to be with in these kinds of things. G said that he is being unfair to me. J still sends multiple messages to G about wanting to talk and wanting to go out with her.

This has been going on for months. G has said nothing to me about this and the only thing that she did to kinda allude to the situation is to text me list of games that I should watch because those are J's favorite teams.

I kinda feel betrayed by both of them. Although I feel more betrayed by J than G.

What should I do? How should I approach this?

**UPDATE**: Thank you everyone for your advice. I approached G first and told her that I've seen the messages. She was relieved that I came to her and talked to her about it. She explained that she didn't know what to do because she didn't want to do anything that would destroy our friendship. She also assured me that next time she will tell me if anything shady like this happens again and that she will always have my back. We both apologized to each other and hugged it out.

I also have to admit that snooping through J's messages are wrong. The reason I did that because there are some rumours that he hits on other girls at away games and I was feeling insecure and worried about it. But it still does not justify the way I went about it.

As for J, we will meet up later tonight. I honestly think it is over between us. He also has a lot of guys friends to go with him to games and he also would never invite me. I would rather salvage my relationship with my friend, than continue my relationship with him and stay feeling insecure.

Thank you people of reddit for the advice.

**UPDATE 2**: G told me that I should start by saying ""Hey, G told me that you were inviting her out to games"" and I did exactly that. J became defensive and told me that he never invited her. I told him that I saw the messages and he asked if G showed me the messages. I told him the truth that I saw it through his fb and he was furious at me. He told me that I violated his privacy and I apologized for it. Then he told me that he was asking out G because his friends felt that G was a lesbian. He was trying to get proof by asking her out and that her not reciprocating is proof that she is one. At this point I'm like ""WHAAAAAT?!"". He said that he was doing that to protect me and I'm like WHAT?. He then left and told me that he needed space and that I should text him after I got my head cleared up. I texted him ""stay away from me and G"". That was honestly a wild ride.",relationship_advice

TIFU by playing a home-made video in my hotel room NSFW,"So this situation started last night. 

I live in the UK but the company I work for is HQed in Ireland so I spend a few nights a week there in a hotel. It just so happens that this is a super high-end hotel but we get a good corporate rate there so it works out pretty reasonable.

My girlfriend lives in Ireland and she was staying with me, and we decided to make some sex videos on my phone. I'll spare you the full details, but let's just say these videos were particularly dirty and verbal, with lots of slurping and gagging noises and references to my dick size.

Anyway we finish around 3-4am, and I decide to start watching some of videos back but the sound on my stupid phone isn't working. I make sure the volume is fully up and the silent switch is off, but no luck. I play the videos a few more times and just figured that my phone is bust.

Suddenly the people in the upstairs room start stomping around and I'm thinking wtf is their problem don't they know it's 4am. Then I realise FUCK my Bluetooth is connected to their speaker - I WAS IN THAT ROOM LAST WEEK. The audio from my sex videos was blaring out in these poor people's bedroom presumably while they were sleeping.

So today I'm checking out and an American guy is furious with the front desk agent telling her that the radio started playing porn in his room and that he and his wife have never been so disgusted. The agent says the hotel will perform a full investigation.

I have planned a fun romantic weekend for my girlfriend and I in Denver, CO. She knows of the trip but doesn't suspect a proposal at all. This woman is so perfect for me. We have had many issues to begin the relationship, often dealing with stupid fights and immaturity on both side. However, we have always remained committed to each other and most importantly willing to work on ourselves and be vulnerable about our flaws.

AITA for talking to my nephew about the birds and the bees?,"My sister and I are twins (35) and she has a 16 year old son. I'm an openly gay man, and my whole family knows and loves my partner. A few months ago, when my nephew came for a visit, he came out to me as gay. He said there was a boy at his school that he's in love with and that they've been together for about 2 months.

He said he hasn't spoken to his parents about it and asked me to keep it a secret and I said no problem. Then he started asking me all sorts of questions, about dating and love, about being gay, about me and what it was like coming out 15 years ago, about my partner, and at the end he got enough courage to ask me about sex. I told him everything I deemed was important and necessary for him to know and asked if he was thinking about sleeping with his boyfriend. He said yes, so I gave him some concrete advice concerning lube and condoms and whatnot.

Anyway, it was a pleasant and normal conversation, he seemed very happy and that was that. Some time later, he decided to come out, last weekend, during a family lunch. His parents and grandparents were there, his sister, myself and my partner. He had a little speech about what a great family we are and how lucky he is seeing how much everyone accepts me and my partner, and knowing he would be equally loved and accepted.

After lunch, he was helping his mom in the kitchen and (this was all told me to me by my nephew; I wasn't there personally) my sister asked him if he was seeing someone. He told her about his boyfriend and she said ""Don't go doing anything silly! Do we need to have a chat about the birds and the bees?"" And he said there was no need since he talked to me already.

My sister flipped out. She came out to the porch, pulled me inside and started screaming at me that what the fuck was I thinking talking to her kid about sex. That he's only 16 and I was only encouraging him to do it. I said that if he had decided to do it, he could have done it without asking me anything first. Then she backtracked and said it was not my place, that I am not his parent and that herself or her husband should have been the ones to talk to him. I said they probably don't know much about gay sex, and she got even angrier and demanded I tell her what I told him. I only said that she was being ridiculous.

As a result of all this, my nephew is now grounded (because my sister and her husband don't want him having sex?) and I'm not getting my calls answered. My partner thinks that maybe, just maybe, I should have advised my nephew to talk to his parents before talking to him about anything. But I think that's silly. What kid wants to talk to their parents about sex??  I don't think I'm an asshole, my sister and brother in law do, and my partner is neutral. What do you think?",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by saying the dumbest thing I've ever said to one of my students,"Background: I'm a high school physics and engineering teacher. This happened 8 hours ago.

Today, with my computer tucked under my arm, I'm asked by a student to sign off a project he was working on (which, formally, requires my signature to make it official). I grabbed my pen and realized that I couldn't sign without dropping my computer. So, I said, ""hey can you hold down that paper? I don't have a hand.""

It was at the point that my stomach dropped of a cliff. Because the student I asked to help me LITERALLY DOESN'T HAVE A HAND. He literally has a nub on the end of his left arm. No palm, no fingers. No hand. And what do I say? I say, in essence, ""hey no-hand person, when I say I don't have a hand really I do but I'm just holding something with it which you can never do but I can do and I'm saying I don't have one. But I do. And you don't."" The dude even uses his non-hand arm to pin down the paper while I sign as if to say ""This is what not having a hand is. Dumbass.""

Long, awkward pause.

Dilemma. Do I acknowledge my dumb-assery? Or do I walk away and then move to Canada immediately? I decide to go for it and call myself out for being stupid.

Thankfully, he's understanding. He makes a few jokes and tells me it ""happens all the time"" and brushes it off with complete grace. Turns out he's the coolest dude ever and I, if I haven't mentioned it before, am an enormous dumbass.

This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory,"A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

I(M43) had a child with my best friend(F40) and my girlfriend(F45) can't cope with it,"My best friend Jen and I had a child 10 years ago. No one of us had found a life partner and Jen was diagnosed with something that would soon leave her infertile. We decided that we were going to have a kid together and I offered to pay for the IVF because I was the one from a wealthy family.

We had our beautiful baby boy and have been happy ever since. We haven't slept together or anything. We live in the same house. But the house is separated in 2 apartments with a big inside patio on the first floor.

This living arrangement works for us and we can raise our boy in a functional family.
3 years ago Jen met Roger who is an awesome guy and father of a daughter. So we do have a patch work family. Roger is a good bud of me Yada Yada.

One year ago Monica and I got together. I was very upfront about my living situation. And she said she was okay with is. Monica herself has 2 kids that I really do like very much.

So now to the problem.
Monica was really nice to Jen in the beginning. But I have been noticing that she is being more passive aggressive towards her. When we have big family outings, meaning taking all the kids to the zoo or a park, Monica does her best to alienate us from the group.

She gets mad when she comes to my place and Jen and I are sitting on the couch watching some sort of cop show. We don't even cuddle we just share a couch.

She gets mad when we take our son to a family trip to a theme park alone because she says it's weird.

She got super fucking mad when I was walking down with Monica to help her pack her car and placed a hand on her back because I was ""inappropriately touching another woman"".

I love Monica and I have tried to be reassuring that, despite me having a child with jen, I don't feel any sort of attraction toward her.

She has been pressuring me to move out which I don't want. The city we live in, is very expensive and the house I live in is all paid for. It's 2 apartments we have full privacy from each other. Jen and Roger also do their thing. I know this is a weird situation. But I have never tried to hide it. I have always been very honest about everything and also honest about my intentions to not moving.

Monica hasn't talked to me in days and I wonder if this relationship has run its course or if I have a shot at repairing it?

Edit : sorry I am bad at conveying stuff. So we don't spend every free second with Jen. This family weekends are like once a month when Roger has his kid ans Monica hers. There we tend to splurge on theme parks, aquariums etc. But ofcourse when Monica comes over she doesn't have to spend time with Jen. As said we have different appartements in the same house. While the doors are unlocked for our sons sake we only spend time in the other apartment when we watch something together or sometimes have family dinner. Which isn't everyday. So we have our privacy.

Edit2: the reason why Jen and I knoe that there are no feelings is because before having our son we talked about it. Having a child in a couple that had o sided feelings would not have worked. We came to the conclusion that no one of us had seen the other at any point in a romantic light.",relationship_advice

Just because a guy isn't comfortable with his girlfriend/wife being revealing doesn't make them controlling.,"Some people actually just don't want the world to see what they have. Maybe it's having a ""Type"" but I like having a girl who isn't comfortable showing so much because that's where feeling special comes to mind. It makes me feel special. I don't judge the girls who do reveal themselves more than others I just don't prefer it for my significant other and that's something that you should know before you get into the relationship. Call it insecurity or controlling but I won't force a girl to cover herself but it's not something I would like to turn the other way to. And before the comments say anything about it being ""vice versa"" I am very secure of myself when it comes to revealing. If they're fine with it or not I will not show myself around for anyone to see what is sacred for my woman. Sorry if this offends anyone just had to get that off of my chest for the simple fact that everyone is literally going around and shouting ""CONTROLLING"" ""INSECURITY"" all because their boyfriend didn't want them to wear only thongs and lingerie bras to a rave.




Edit: so someone commented but deleted their comment before I could reply so I'll repeat what was said. It was something along the lines of ""it is insecurity and not so much preference, maybe you should re-evaluate your way.. and no one is ""yours to begin with"" or something like that sorry I can't remember well but I know it offended me because of the word ""re evaluate"" and this was my response:

""Do you know a relationship is a duo thing. A partner thing where it's not just about you anymore it's about the both of you. I don't get into relationships for fun. My goal is to marry and if that isn't yours then that's fine I guess do whatever you want. But it's not longer inviting me to a party it's inviting us. We come as a group. Have you ever heard someone call another person their other half? Are you going to call them wrong and say that ""well they're not yours"" it's a figure of speech. Where does a relationship draw the line? Because they're not ""yours"" literally, means they can go out and cheat? And it be okay because they're not yours? No. There's certain things you expect in a relationship and sorry if you disagree or feel offended but it's not something I need to work on. If I feel like I don't want my significant other to be revealing that's my choice, just as it is vice versa if they don't want a significant other who cares about what they wear. It has EVERYTHING to do with preference. It's not controlling it's not insecurity it's preference. If I choose not to be with a girl because I don't want to deal with that topic then that's okay and I'm not obligated to change my ways because someone wants me to adapt to their life if they can't adapt to mine.""",unpopularopinion

She didn't speak to me all day Monday and the last words I heard from her were Sunday night after she got home as she slammed the door to our bedroom saying ""you're still a controlling asshole and we're breaking up."" Her nuclear bomb is always saying ""we're breaking up"" whenever she doesn't have the upper hand in an argument so I didn't make much of it and in reality I was just relieved that she was home and apparently nothing bad happened at the dinner. So like I said, Monday she didn't say a word to me. I was only able to get into our bedroom to get some clothes and I couched it again Monday night. Whatever, she was pissed, she was embarrassed that she didn't see it coming, she was angry at me. I figured I'd give her some space. So I did. 

Tuesday morning I noticed she was getting ready for work. I couldn't keep my mouth shut any more and I incredulously asked her if she was really going back to that fucking job? She said ""why wouldn't I?"" I told her because the FUCKING OWNER off the company had done a month long manipulation to get her into a threesome with his other little side piece. She said that I was a fucking idiot. I was fucking flabbergasted. As she was stomping around the house putting her shoes on putting on her makeup and what not I told her that IF she shows up to that office today and doesn't quit or follow up with the state bar, he is going to know that she's OK with what happened, at least on the surface. Even if she doesn't have sex with him, he knows that she has a really high tolerance for his bullshit and he's going to keep working at her. I also told her that she has an MBA with a focus in HR, it shouldn't take a fucking an red-neck auto-mechanic to tell her this shit (I own a foreign specialty auto repair facility with my uncle). Her last words to me were ""yes fucking asshole, I AM the professional. you aren't"" and slammed the door. 

So Tuesday I had no idea what I was going to do. I knew in my heart I needed to end the relationship, her situation with her boss notwithstanding, rather her method of fighting, name calling, silent treatment are just not acceptable. But I still wasn't sure. 

She got home Tuesday and was clearly rattled by something. She was still silent, but a sad silent not an angry silent if that makes sense. She absolutely would not tell me what was wrong but she didn't lock herself in the room this time. She just sat almost catatonic on the couch watching Big Bang Theory (which she hates). My assumption...she fucked him, her or both. She gave into him. I have no proof of this but after all the bullshit, after the quick change in her behavior...its the only thing I can think happened. 

In my head and heart, we are broken up. It's now just a matter of separating our shit, figure out what to do about the lease on our apartment, cancelling the small amount of wedding planning we have done...and oh yeah...telling her. She may be feeling the same way and be done with me too which honestly may make this easier for everyone. My heart goes out to her because I do care about her and if she did have sex with her boss under his bullshit pretense, I imagine she feels like shit. But I tried to warn her. I saw it coming from a mile away, no I didn't use the correct words in trying warn her and I take no pleasure in being ""right"" but I did try. 

Thanks everyone...still ESH!  


Edit: it's 3:31pm MST she's home about 2.5 hours early. She said she wants to take a shower and talk after she's done. I really don't want to do another OP update but I will update via edit here after we talk. 

Edit: now about 5:30. This is locked so I don't know if an edit gets seen or not, figure I'll try since people seem invested in it. Obviously this is so much past whether I'm an asshole or not and just into keeping people who wanted to know informed. For some people I'm a victim, for some people I'm a victimizer. I asked for people's opinion so I will try very hard to keep both in mind going forward. A sincere thank you for your input, good or bad. 

So update. She got home at 3:30. Was still very pissy and told me not to ask her any questions until she got out of the shower and said she wanted to talk then. She usually gets home at 6pm on the dot so I knew something was up. I said that was fine but like literally on pins and needles until she came back out to our computer room where I was working. So about 4:15 she comes out in a with a towel wrapped around her hair and just one around her waist. In my head I figure if she was really breaking up with me she wouldn't be let me see her boobs (editorializing: her nearly perfectly perky D cup boobs). It wasn't a sexual gesture by any stretch but it also was showing that she wasn't covering up around me. I took that as a good sign because I wasn't sure about breaking up with her and at least we had options. So first of all as nutty as I made her deservedly sound, she has never had compunctions about apologizing when she's wrong. So she said that she wanted to say that she was very sorry for all the things that she had said to me starting on Sunday, she was sorry for throwing her shoe at me, she was sorry for the silent treatment and she was sorry for doubting my judgement. I told her that I appreciated it. She told me that she quit yesteday. I told her that I very much agreed with that. 

She said that yesterday she went into the office and the boss/owner was waiting for her in her office (this is important to mention, the law firm is an old converted historic house close to downtown, most of the staff work in what used to be the main house, my fiancé's office was literally the outdoor shed/garage. It's a very nice and comfortable conversion but it's still separated from the main ""house."" So him sitting in her office means he had to go out in the backyard, find a key he doesn't usually have, unlock her space and wait for her. On the first day back from a holiday). He told her that he wanted to make sure there were ""no misunderstandings"" from the night prior and to make sure that all the doors weren't shut or some such nonsense. She told me she told him that she was deeply upset by his proposal and didn't know what she was going to do. I guess he told her that her value in the company could either go up or down depending on how she decided to proceed. She said that she walked out on the spot and didn't go back to work. She spent the rest of the day with her sister trying to figure out what she was going to do. That was yesterday and I guess she still doesn't know. I guess she spent all day today looking for other jobs and sitting in her employment office of her MBA office and talking with her advisor. I asked her why she just didn't tell me any of this yesterday and why scream at me. She said she was sorry again but she was a little shell shocked that she faced serious sexual harassment in her first job out of the gate and honestly didn't even know what she wanted to say to me. I told her that the silent treatment really hurt AND it allowed my imagination to run wild (I didn't tell her what I said here, in this OP). She again said she was sorry and the way she acted throughout the entire event wasn't fair. I told her that I really do love her but I hadn't slept in two nights, I am exhausted and hurt and don't know what to do so I'm going to go stay at my uncles house for at least a few nights, to sleep if nothing else. She said that was fine and she'd wait as long as I wanted her to. I told her that I think we need some sort of counseling so we learn how to better talk with each other. She agreed.

So after that I packed up a bag and am now at my uncles house. She did give me a bare chested hug and kiss on the cheek on my way out the door which was pretty nice (and niiiiiiiicee….) but right now I need some sleep. 


What I do know: 


1. I want to stay with her. 


2. I need to never use words like ""you can't go"" ever again. 


3. I really do love her. 

4. We are fine for money without her working. I am co-owner of a auto-repair business with my uncle and we have had a great few years.


What I don't know (and didn't ask, yet at least):


1. What is she going to do about her boss?


2. How this affects her future employment. 

3. That she will realize we are fine without her working and she takes her time and finds a good job with a good boss. 


I'm sure there's a million other things I'm forgetting or questions I'm not answering. I think the mods are sick of this thread so it's locked. I'm newish to reddit so I don't know if you can see this, if you can respond, if it's dead...just don't know. 

but thanks for the help.

These social networks have an undeniable bad influence on people and can be manipulated to generate artificial trends (russian bots in Trump's campaign, russian bots involved in Mexican Elections etc).Also they boost depression, social anxiety and antipathy.

Maybe I should add Reddit to this list too.

AITA for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I wanted to ask: AITA for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?

&#x200B;

Last month I took part in a retreat. The location's internet didn't work, so we all just had our mobile data. There was a deaf participant from Russia, and he couldn't access the mobile network with his phone. So he asked me if I could give him access through hotspot so he can communicate with his family.

I have limited mobile data, I get 500mb per month and from there on, I pay 5 bucks for each 100mb (it's pretty expensive here). I only use mobile data for WhatsApp and maybe sometimes to check my schedule. 

So I agreed to give him hotspot under the condition that he only uses it for WhatsApp. No videos, no excessive photo transmissions because it's limited. He agreed.

&#x200B;

But when I got lasts month bill I was kinda shocked: he apparently used over 6GB additionally. I was able to track it down to him because this huge amount of data was consumed during these two retreat days. But before confronting him via Facebook, I asked a friend who was his roommate, if he noticed anything. He told me that this Russian guy did sign language videochat the whole night through with his parents. I asked my friend if he had the impression that it were an emergency, but he said that their chat seemed very lighthearted and included lots of laughing.

&#x200B;

So I don't know what to do. The bill is over 60 bucks, my budget doesn't really allow it. And I told the deaf guy in advance to only use WhatsApp, but I didn't get a warning that he was using so much data, so he maybe didn't even realize it. In addition, my friend told me that I should give him the benefit of being disabled where videochatting is often the easiest way of communication...",AmItheAsshole

I(22M) Recently discovered My Dad (50M) choose me over my former Stepmother and Half-sister(17F) 6 years ago. Don't know how to process this.,"I was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. Both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. When I was sent to live with my dad, I was broken. I barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  I wasn't mad or angry. I was null of any kind of emotion. Basically I was alive but wasn't living. I kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. I was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. I was more social with my dad but I kept it to a bare minimum.  I had noting left to say to anyone. It took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. That's how withdrawn I had become.

Dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  When I experienced night- terrors, I would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  He drove me to all of my therapist appointments. He made sure I was eating properly. There were days, I would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. He literally went above and beyond for me. I hated the city that were living in. Because  I had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

I was so passive, it was scary. My therapist had told my dad that I was stuck in the victim's cycle; I didn't know how to get out. Because of this, I was bullied quite a bit. By the time I was 15, I had been to 3 different schools. It got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. I was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. Noting would motivate me.

Looking back, Dad did spoil me but at the time I wasn't aware of it. I was so in my own body that I barley acknowledged my surroundings.   If I asked my dad for a new bed spread, I would get me new one plus new furniture. My phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. I was grateful and thanked him. I did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. Again I was being polite. I didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. I barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

By the time I was 16, Dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. I didn't question it. He had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. I didn't think it was any of my business so I didn't press the issue. A year later, Dad had divorced my stepmother. One of Dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in Boston and he took it. We moved and I felt I was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. That year was probably the best year of my life. I was coming out of my shell. There was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. It was if I was like everyone else. I felt ""normal"". I became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, I was going out more. Us moving probably saved my life.

Because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. There was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. You could just sense it. It got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

Me and Dad have always been close. When I had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, I could see my dad crying in the crowd. I lived with my dad while I attended college ( I still do for the time being) . Ever since I was child, I always wanted to be a doctor. Well, I just finished my first year of medical school. Honestly, I feel like a normal young adult in society. I have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom I've been with for 4 years. I'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

Recently, I got FB message from my half-sister. She was apologizing a lot and I had no clue what she was talking about. Turns out, the reason why Dad and I moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what I was watching her change........... Yes. She told her mom that I was watching her change.. At the time, I was traumatized of sex. Heck I was terrified of any form of intimacy. The kid was envious of what Dad was doing for me. She was so envious that she tried to move me out. Well I guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and I'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. Because we moved out, I think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. How can someone be so cruel? What did I ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. I didn't even respond. More importantly, Dad never let this to get back to me. Chances are if I had heard about this when I was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. It also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

This is a lot to take in and I have a new found of respect and love for my dad. He gave up this marriage for me so I could live a normal life.Dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. I'm missing him a lot lately.

Should I bring it up to him when he returns? Also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? At the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and I almost want to help.

Tl;dr: Dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. Dad kept it from me for 6 years. Should I bring up with him?

Edit: I wasn't expecting such a huge response. I just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. It will take some time but I will read all of them or as much as I can. As I was going through the comments, I found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. This a part of my life. I don't normally like to talk about about this . Aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. The fact the people are saying that it's fake.... I don't what to say. It's not my place to try and convince anyone. Believe  me, they're times I wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. When I wrote this, I wasn't thinking about syntax. It was more just getting this out. People questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. Forgive me but I wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

As for how I became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; I did respond to it in the comments but I'll post it here too. 

""It was very unorthodox how I became valedictorian after attending a real HS for only a year. My overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because I was in online classes for my previous hears, I wasn't eligible at the time. I met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

I broke down in front of the coordinator and I told her the truth. Being named valedictorian was something I always wanted. To be that would have been my first accomplishment that I would have achieved based on my own merit. Yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. It wasn't trying to be Valedictorian financial reasons. Money wasn't a problem (Dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. This would have helped me self-worth as well.

The girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and I told her the truth. She actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. It something I'll forever be grateful for. That's actually how me and her became friends."". Not many people would do that and in HS. 

I'll be posting again. I just need a few days.",relationship_advice
"UPDATE: My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but I'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is.

So I got lots of feedback on what to do here. A good majority of the commenters told me to say something. To clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but I was never planning on doing nothing. Of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. I just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

Some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. Some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which I ended up getting from Alison, the third party friend. Some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me I was a bad friend. Some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. Well all of you were somewhat right. Here's how it went down: 

I messaged Alison early on in the day, shortly after I made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. I said to Alison that I needed to tell Aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. This was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

Aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that Alison came over too. We all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about Mary. Alison showed him the text screenshots of Mary talking to her ex, and also told Aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

What was the most surprising was his reaction. He took it very well. He first got very quiet, and just nodded. Aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. He was not aware of the hookups, but he and Mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. He told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. There were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. He knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

We started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. He cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. Then he got angry. At her, and even more so at the guy. Some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

Ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. We told him a million times how much better he deserved. He's definitely not going to marry her. 

Thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. We saved a good man from heartbreak!

"[update](AZ) Our neighbor's dog was apparently poisoned and because we had complained about the dog barking, police wanted to go through our ""internet history.""","Original here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a75f0o/az_our_neighbors_dog_was_poisoned_police_want_to/

>Edit: hey guys I'm involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in DM but it would sure be easier if I could just answer them once. I'm sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, I really don't want to say where I am and my attorneys name. All the laws I found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

So thank you to everyone who responded. And I guess thank you to everyone in the DMs who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, I want to sleep in my own house. Just to allay the fears of the other nice DM's, I did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. Also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

I took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on Monday night. I also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. I called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

He was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the DA actually pursuing this were slim to none. He did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, I could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. He said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


So basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as I type this) but I just heard (Wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. Basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. In fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. The people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. They also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all I know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people I've ever encountered). The can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). So with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

So our complaint to animal control from last Thursday is still on the books. The lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. Our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. The criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

&nbsp; 

My girlfriend has a ~2013 Lenovo laptop that has seen better days. As it stands right now, among some other issues, her keyboard totally doesn't work. Because of this, she always uses a small bluetooth keyboard with her laptop.

&nbsp;

She had texted me the next morning saying that her wireless keyboard had stopped working as well. We had already planned for me to stay the night at her place after I got off work, so I offered to stop by my place on the way to grab her a keyboard, as I have a few extras.

&nbsp;

When I got to her place, she was eagerly awaiting the keyboard, which makes sense, as she wasn't able to use her computer for most of the day. But when I handed her the keyboard, she started getting really quiet and pouty. A bit later, when I asked her what was wrong, she said she thought I'd be bringing her something nicer, like the keyboard I have at my desk.

&nbsp;

The thing is, I have a really nice keyboard at my desk. I'm a programmer, and I love this keyboard so much that I also bring it to work with me. I even have specific macro profiles for it that definitely improve my workflow.

&nbsp; 

For context, I had an extra Amazon Basics keyboard  (~$15) lying around, still brand new in the box. My personal keyboard, which I've had for years, is some variant of the Razer Blackwidow (~$120).

&nbsp; 

Anyway, she was apparently expecting me to be 'selfless' and let her use my nice keyboard while I used the Amazon keyboard. She was upset that I didn't ""value her enough"" to lend her my nice posessions, and left her with the ""cheap $10 keyboard"" (her words). She said if the situation was reversed, she'd lend me the nice keyboard. I explained to her that I have my keyboard specifically set up for work, and because I'm so used to it, it would hinder my ability to do work if I didn't have it.

 &nbsp;

We continued to argue about it. Things really came to a head when she boldly claimed that if I wasn't willing to lend her my nice keyboard, that I ""should have bought her a nice new keyboard if I really cared about her."" This is when I got really mad. I told her she was acting like an entitled, spoiled child and that she should have been grateful that I went out of my way in the first place to grab her the Amazon keyboard. She started crying and asked me to go home. I left, but I still gave her the Amazon keyboard to use. **I was far more upset at the principle of the situation than the keyboard itself.**

&nbsp;

So now she's calling me an asshole for both not giving her my keyboard AND because I called her spoiled. We're going to meet up tomorrow to talk about this in person because I refused to continue this silly argument over text.

&nbsp;

I'm thinking about ending things with her, as I feel like this is her showing me her true colors.

&nbsp;

TL;DR: GFs keyboard broke. I lent her one of my extras, and she got upset that it was a 'cheap' keyboard. I called her spoiled, which infuriated her.

&nbsp;

**EDIT:** She texted me asking to meet up tonight instead of tomorrow, as she is feeling anxious and stressed about the situation. **I will give everyone an update later tonight or tomorrow morning.**


&nbsp; 

I also wanted to clarify that she's never acted like this before (although, admittedly, we haven't been together for very long). Some of you suggested that maybe I'm not making her feel 'valued' and this situation is a symptom of that. While I think I both show AND tell her that she's valued in different ways, this may be something I bring up with her. It, of course, doesn't forgive her behavior, but may explain some of it.  Cheers.

Should I (24M) leave my gf (24F) over her weight?,"Hi, before you start thinking im shallow hear me out. Ive been with my gf for about a year and she is the kindest person ive ever met and I love her to bits. She is perfect in every way except one.

&#x200B;

She has gained alot of weight and is now obese. I have been trying for months and months to get her in shape and I know she wants to but shes just extremely lazy and full of excuses.

&#x200B;

It doesnt help that im abit of a fitness fanatic, I have asked her to come to the gym with me, she says shes too embarassed. Lets go for a run, same thing. Have u tried a vegan diet? no will power. I  found some cool workout videos u can do at home, never did it. Brought her a fitbit, doesnt use it. Asked her to count calories, says its too much effort. Asked her to record her weight every 2 weeks, scales ran out of battery, I found a cool subreddit (loseit), never went on it. She also lies about what she eats.

&#x200B;

Theres an excuse for everything. When I think of my future, I think of her suffering from health problems as a result and ultimately dying young because of this. Nobody wants their wife to die at 60 and life the rest of their lives alone. When I think of a perfect future, it is with her but a healthy version and im thinking of just cutting it off and saving myself the heartbreak in the future because I dont have much hope that she will change.

&#x200B;

You can call me shallow but part of this is the attraction side. Im not gonna sugar coat it but obese people just arnt attractive to me so right now im only with her for her personality. When she was smaller she was really pretty which is what made me first go up and speak to her, now I dont even recognise her. If you have any advice or comments I will be super grateful, thankyou

&#x200B;

Edit: I went to sleep when this had about 20 comments and i woke up to over a thousand! Thankyou for all your kind messages and stories. Im glad people understand where im coming from. I thought most people will be angry that I dare to question her weight and how u can be healthy and obese which im glad theres only a few comments like that which I just have to say you are dillusional!.

I am going to get her an appointment with a therapist soon, I wont explicitly say its a therapist but a sort of talk session about different problems you might face and a place to get things of your chest. I feel like the word therapist scares some people. Also whenever I see her im gonna tell her not to drive because we are walking. Alot of people mentioned sports too, I could buy a basketball and see if she will play with me. I wont make any harsh desicions now but in my mind I will give her 5 months to get into a reasonable shape. If I dont see any improvment then I know there is no hope and will leave her. Thanks again you lovely people, I will be reading the comments still :)

&#x200B;

Another Edit: I cannot reply to all your comments but I have read most of them! Some of your stories have been great to read. A quick update i decided to book her a therapy session for a few weeks time and told her about it. She took it really well. To all the people who are asking how much weight she gained, I dont know because she would never tell me her weight. I really hope this relationship survives because i litrally love her with all my heart but I shall know in a few months. I will make an updated post then if anyone is intrested too.",relationship_advice

"Why do people call Post Malone a rapper? After flicking through his two albums, his vocal style sounds a lot more like singing than rapping.","I know that it's possible to rap ""to a melody"" so to speak, and some vocals seem to sit somewhere between rapping and singing (e.g. Eminem often has choruses that seem to sit in this category, and in heavy metal there are vocals that seem to sit between screaming and singing). However, listening to Post Malone's music now, it seems that all of it is basically just singing.

If you think about most rappers, most of their rapping is just saying the words over a beat, mostly non-melodically (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prmQgSpV3fA). Post-Malone doesn't seem to do this. He seems to just sing melodies. On his wiki, he's listed as a 'rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer'. He seems much more a singer than rapper to me. So why is he considered a rapper?",NoStupidQuestions
UPDATE: AITA for making a dad joke?,"My son found the post, and shared it with my daughter. This was after apologizing to her. She cried again. 
  
So last week, we decided to have a father/daughter bonding weekend. Honestly, it was awesome. I took her bowling, to get a manicure, becoming Disney princesses(I looked awesome as Jasmine), and so forth. She loved it. I loved it. Everyone was happy. Then we decided to go out to eat dinner. ""I'm starving, what do you want Maddie?"" ""Hi Starving, I'm not your daughter"". She had this biggest smirk on her face. She hugged me and I kissed her forehead. I'm sure she'd been planning this for weeks.

AITA for objecting to 'girls day'?,"I'm a 28 y/o male and my immediate family is all women, mostly this is because I was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when I was young. My two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. 


About 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. Originally this was to see one of the Magic Mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. Originally it didn't bother me, because I'm an adult and I have my own life, and my own house, and I really didn't even think about it. But an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. My aunt's birthday was in January and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. So I bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. 


When I asked what was going on for her birthday, I was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. This kind of irked me because when I mentioned I bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. I felt pretty left out since I am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. 


I griped about and was told that I was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. I agree with that, but once again, I'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was I was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when I asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. 

At this point I was VERY annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. Nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so I decided I needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. So I removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my Facebook. Now my phone is being blown up and I'm being told that I'm immature and I need to grow up. I responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and I'm just going to follow that example. 


Am I the asshole here? ",AmItheAsshole
I [27M] don't feel sexually compatible with my fiancee [27F],"*(posted from a throwaway account; I'd rather not have this on my posting history. I previously posted it, felt bad and deleted it, but having thought about it again I realise I need to get it off my chest.)*

I'm currently engaged to a girl that I absolutely love, we've been together for the best part of 10 years, and the wedding has been arranged for March. The start of that whole ""*wedding, buying a house and starting a family*"" time. Everything is pretty much perfect, apart from one issue: I feel like the bedroom is dead and/or we're just not compatible sexually.

Just to get the obvious out of the way:

1. I don't have any ""*extreme tastes*"" or anything like that; we're hardly talking about BDSM! Everything involved is distinctively *vanilla* \- i.e tie'n'tease, massages, or a little toy play.
2. Yes, we've been together for 10 years; but if I'm feeling this way before we're even married (**and when I'm still in my twenties**) then it genuinely concerns me about the future.
3. I *know* that communications are incredibly important in a relationship, yet it feels like we've discussed this topic before and.. it was pointless. Pointless either by her defensiveness, or just for the sheer lack of anything changing.

Sex is incredibly important to me - be it for intimacy, pleasure, or both. It just feels like we both have entirely different attitudes though. There are times where I want it slow, so as to savour it and take the most pleasure, there are times where I want it to be intimate and tender, then other times where I may want to be hard and energetic... regardless of these wants though, it's *the same*.

Often it feels like she uses friends as comparators - i.e ""*they haven't had sex in months - I dont know how they do that!*"". Well to be blunt, I'm not in a relationship with her friends, nor do I have the exact same desires as her friends. Other times she may say that I ""*never want normal sex*""; which just isn't true. It makes it sound like she's constantly dressing up or we're doing something exotic; she may put on some stockings 3 or 4 times a year, which I really appreciate... but that's it.

Previous chats have been fruitless, so I've tried to communicate in other ways. That's usually meant buying little things we could try - perhaps a couple of toys, or little tie'n'tease restraints. Quite often these would be used once or twice, and then thrown in a box to gather dust. So I've now opted for books, *specifically with topics for both me and her*, ranging from intimate massage to oral play. I hope this shows that I don't even care for specific fantasies, I just want to play and have fun, *and I recognise that's a two way street.*

She recently embarrassed me (I think she'd had a couple of drinks at the time, so I didn't say anything.) by talking to friends about one of the items I purchased. She made it sound like it was something exotic, it was a bit of an anti-climax when they realised it was just a wand. Yet as I sat there feeling awkward I just realised that I think it's pointless trying to communicate via items or books too, and in combination with words having no effect.. I just feel stuck.

We *have* spoken before about these things, but it never changes anything. She's never really spoken about what *she'd like*, hence me trying to experiment. Yet for me, the few turn-ons that I've mentioned - all incredibly vanilla at that (i.e stockings, tie'n'tease/edging, or simply seeing her enjoy herself.) - are just.. well, it feels like they're forgotten immediately after any conversation.

So I'm sitting here genuinely worried about the future; I have someone I love and I want to spend the rest of my life with, but similarly someone I don't feel compatibility with in a very important way. The last thing I'd want to do is to nag her or make her feel pressured; that's not acceptable. Yet I'm struggling with how this makes me feel; realistically I'm not bad looking, but I begin to focus on weight I could lose etc. It also changes my perception of her - I then begin to find her less attractive, and go off sex all together as *I simply don't feel fulfilled*. I just feel stuck.",relationship_advice

"TIFU, the story of how I was rescued from death by my school bully","So a few weeks ago, me and the boys decided to have a nice little gathering and crack open a few cold ones round the fire. 
I had told my parents I would be back at 10, but didn't specify to them that I meant AM not PM, and that was my first mistake. 

Upon arriving at my friend's house, the clock drew 8:00, and I got a call from my parents asking if I was still coming home at 10... in the evening. Immediately, I tried to bargain, but to no avail (thus is the life of a teen raised by strict parents). They told me I would have to get a lift back home, but due to nobody being able to do such a thing, they said I would have to walk.
Angrily, I packed my things, drank one last coldie, said goodbye to the boys, and set off into the beyond.

To set the scene: my friend's house was in a town, surrounded on all sides by rolling fields and musty forests, and it was 6 miles away and 4 villages from my house.
I left the town, setting off at a brisk jog as the sun began to set. By 9:00 I had passed through Village 1 and made it safely to Village 2, by which point everything was grey. The sun had set, and night was on it's way. Feeling already defeated, and only 1 mile into my trek - I asked for a lift from a stranger, to which he replied ""fuck off"".

So at this point i'm just wandering country roads on my way home, but decide to take a shortcut to pass time. 
And this is where I fucked up.
I took a right turn after Village 2, and walked through endless fields, stood in fox shit, got cut all up my arms and legs (I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts) by tall reeds and thistles, and I got well and truly lost. 

By this point, 10:30, I had missed my deadline to return home, and was in the middle of nowhere in complete darkness - the only lights being the far away orange glimmer of Villages 3 and 4, and my hometown. It was still miles away.
Nevertheless, semi-drunk me thought he knew his bearings, and wandered aimlessly for another full hour, falling into ditches and getting caked in mud, until my iPod's battery finally died and my one source of light faded away.
I was next to a motorway, and I thought I was on the right side of it, however my home was across the sea of traffic (not really a sea, more of a stream due to the late night drivers). 

I decided against running across the motorway, because at this point I thought I was on the right side of it anyway. 
I eventually stumbled through a small forest and ended up in a cornfield. So bearing in mind, it's now 11:30PM, it's pitch black, and I can only see about 2 feet in front of me... oh yeah and i'm in a fucking cornfield.
So I continued my Outlast 2 journey, wandering through this massive maze of maize, until I heard rustling.
Barks soon followed, and I heard the padding of desperate hungry feet behind me.
""FUCK!""

I remember screaming, I ran faster than I ever had, as the barks of dogs chasing me grew louder and louder - and they were big fucking dogs, we're talking bloodthirsty Great Dames.
I was heading towards a tree, my only safety, when a blaring light shone across the corn, illuminating me and the dogs that now ran towards the source.
""OI! WHO THE FUCKS THAT!""

They thought I was a poacher - the farmer's wife and the farmer - but even after telling them that I was merely a lost crybaby 17 year old boy who wanted to go home (and had pissed himself) they still refused to give me a lift home. 
Until...
""Who are you talking to, Mum?""
A voice sounded to her left.
""Some boy, he's lost.""
""What's his name?""
She told him my name, to which he replied with a laugh.
Long story short; I had ran onto the farm of my school bully's property, and after giving me a full-on fucking roasting, he and his mum drove me home at 00:00. 
I stumbled in, covered in my own piss, tears, fox shit, thistles, reeds, mud, and pollen (giving me a very nasty allergy and forcing my left eye shut). 
I didn't even talk to my parents, who didn't even ask if I was okay, and fell asleep.



Tl;dr: I walked home from a party, got lost, chased by dogs, and was rescued by my school bully.

Edit: numerous people complained about a lack of paragraphs so I have added them in, very sorry everyone. I was going to edit out ""Dames"" to ""Danes"" but apparently the misspelling is quite funny so i'm gonna leave it.

TIFU by having the worst sex of my life with a complete stranger and then meeting her mom right afterwards,"This actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. In 2016 I started using Tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. I had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. My profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of ""not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices"" and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. 

Fast forward to March of 2017 and I matched with someone. After a couple of one-off messages that don't really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. A couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. This all sounds great. Except for two problems.

The first problem is that I have a beard in all of my photos. And even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. My facial hair is like if someone shaved a Guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. If I grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. Wiry and sparse. It's not good. For six years, I'd still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. But for some reason, the week before we started talking, I had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. I just wanted to know what it looked like. The answer? Not. Fucking. Good. At this point, I was 27 but still looked young for my age. Shave the beard off and I look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. Really fucking awkward.

So I pulled up to her house and text before I got out of my car to say, ""hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it's just me."" Luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as I expected. All good so far.

I went inside and we end up hanging out all night. She cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. She was blown away by the fact that I'd never seen Labyrinth and demanded we watch it. We ended up watching three movies that night. For Labyrinth, I was about five feet away on the couch. For Young Frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. For the third movie (which I can't remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. And this is where the second problem comes in. 

After my breakup in 2016 and realizing I'd been battling lifelong depression, I started taking antidepressants. One of the SUPER FUN side effects of SSRIs is that it can be really hard to climax. Like, try as you might, nothin. Dust. Moths. Nothin. Thanks, Big Pharma.

And so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. Two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like ""holy fuck I might have a heart attack. Why are my ears ringing so loudly?"" and ""What about this position?"" ""OUCH!"" ""Oh my god, I need a towel. So. Much. Sweat. I can't see."" We were in the basement on a large three piece couch. You know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. Well at one point I tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. A bruised ass. A bent dick. A lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. 

If this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. Well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven't done any cardio in your fucking life. And jesus christ the sweat. So fucking slippery and gross. This wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. This is bog monsters come to life sweat. This is Ace Ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. At one point our chests become suction cupped together. I could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn't felt like it was going to explode. And the chafing. FUCK. No matter how ready either of y'all are when you start out, after two hours, it's gonna wear off. We both felt like we'd attacked our bits with sandpaper. My poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. Not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. This was no climactic movie sex scene. This was a John Waters film come to life. 

Well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. It's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. We went outside for a smoke and at this point it's about 6am. I'm wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she's only in a bathrobe. We sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (She had just moved back home before finding a new place). So not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now I get to meet her mom for the first time! GREAT! I'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. Somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent Tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. Life is fucking weird.

Well, the reason I am posting this on March 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we're engaged to be married on March 14th of 2020. Our sex life is FAR better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. I mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. 

TL;DR I met up with a Tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. Now we're engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.




EDIT: Just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! I am still wholly undecided if I will ever show her this post. It's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. We'll see though. And thank you so much for the gold and silver! Did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. And for those asking, I've changed my dosage on my SSRI and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. Talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! And also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. He didn't pan out. Within three months, her mom got hit up by several Tinder guys claiming to be part of the ""oil business"" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. Tinder can be amazing and terrifying...

EDIT2: I guess now I probably have to show this to my fiancée to which she will reply, ""I have no idea what any of that means. Good for you, I guess?"" I still love her.

EDIT3: A few of y'all keep asking, ""why in TIFU?"" Well, let me tell ya, if I had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. Even worse than my breakup the year before. Not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? Yeah, that sucked. Just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't SUCK ASSSSS on the whole. I mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk

FINAL EDIT: For real y'all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations.

TIFU by basically buying a serial killer starter kit at my local hardware store...,"This happened earlier today and I'm pretty sure I'm on a police watch list now.

Needed to pick up a few things from my local hardware store I was running low on that I like to have around. Zip ties, duck tape, and things for quick repairs. 

While I was there I noticed they were having a store wide sale. I'm an avid outdoorsmen and with hunting season coming up I like to keep certain back up items in my truck if I need them. I figured I would grab some things while they are on sale.

Walking through the isles I start randomly grabbing items I think I might need for my kit. Such as a tarp, some rope, large knife, headlamp, latex gloves, and a lantern with extra batteries.

Keep in mind I already have zip ties and duct tape in my cart when I walk up to the register. These are things I generally purchase, buy never all at once.

Girl at the register greets me as I start placing items on the counter. I give her my number for rewards points and she quickly starts scanning things.

About half way through she slows down a bit. She looks down at my already bagged items, at the stuff left on the counter, and then back to me. I'm just standing there waiting with my wallet in hand, clueless as to what is now processing in her head.

Then we have a light convo that in hindsight prob made things worse:

Her: ""Wow that's a big knife.""
Me: ""Yeah I like having cheap, throwaway knives around. Same with tarps and stuff too.""
Stares at me funny after my reply as she scans knife.

Her: ""Can I see your ID to verify your at least 18 to purchase this.""
Me being 30, going bald, and grey in my beard looks at her weird as I've never been asked for my ID here. Pull it out and hand it to her. 

She quickly looks at my ID info and then glances up at her screen where I noticed my reward info was pulled up. Didn't think anything of it at the time.

She says thanks, hands it back while still looking at it, and finishes scanning my items. Almost looking like she was taking inventory of what I had.

She gives me my total and I hand her some cash (prob another red flag, no paper trail.)

I get my change, grab my bags, and head for the door. She yells back don't forget your receipt as she walks it over to me. I grab it as I notice her quickly glance up at the security camera in front of the door.
I say thanks and leave thinking that whole situation was weird.

I get home and start unpacking my bags to sort stuff out on my kitchen table when my wife comes up behind me. She glances at my items and jokingly asks if she should be worried.

I was like what? Still clueless. Before she points out that it looks like I'm about to go tie someone up and murder them.

Girl at register must have thought the same thing. Checked my info and I'm pretty sure made sure she got my face on the security camera in case someone pops up murdered on the news later.

Told my wife about cashier and she about died laughing at me for being so clueless.

TL;DR: 
Bought zip ties, duct tape, knife, tarp, rope, and other questionable items randomly for hunting season on sale at my local hardware store. Pretty sure cashier thought I was a serial killer.",tifu

AITA for getting a family thrown out of a restaurant for underage drinking?,"Throwaway account.  We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

But as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so. 

My husband said that it was a crappy thing for me to do. I feel like I was protecting the restaurant. Was I the Asshole?",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by unintentionally giving my friend a masturbation alert,"So after five months of doing this shit I realized today that this has been happening.

Before this happened I was unaware incognito mode on Chrome was a thing. Because of this every time I would go to a certain NSFW website I would type the link into a Discord (basically the new Skype) direct message to my friend that lives across the country. I only send the links to him while it said he is offline. I did this so my Chrome wouldn't save the keystrokes of whatever website I decided to visit that day and show up in the predictive search. I would then click on the link of the website through Discord and delete the message. Little did I know that my friend has Discord notifications that show up on his phone for whenever he receives a message. He basically had an alert for every time I masturbated.

So after I had been doing this for a while he finally decides to ask me why he receives all of these NSFW links in the middle of the day. I start laughing out of embarrassment because of these notifications he's been receiving. I told him about the whole process I go through just to get to a website. After that he proceeds to laugh for a good few minutes and tell me about incognito mode on Chrome as my embarrassment keeps rising. After more laughing we moved on.  

I'm glad to know about incognito mode though I will probably keep doing it has I have been because I'm used to it and it's a great inside joke.   


TL;DR: I have been sending NSFW links to my friend on Discord for the past five months while he isn't online to avoid predictive search. He has Discord notifications enabled on his phone therefore giving him an alert every time I masturbate .",tifu
TIFU by listening to my GF's obviously stupid game.,"So, yesterday my girlfriend and I were playing around, you know as lovers do...naked. Some time in this whole play activity, she asked if I could stick my penis in a bottle.

Now, this was a weird thing to me but I thought maybe it was one of her fetishes so I went ahead and did it. It didn't fit in the first two bottles we could find (yes I know...humblebrag) but the third one had a wide enough neck/opening for at least most of it to go in rather snuggly. She started laughing and I started forcing a fake laugh and then asked her, how long she wants me to do it for. She never replied and then she just started playing with the part of my twig and berries that was not in the bottle...causing me to get hard. She knew what she was doing was causing this but would not stop. I begged her to stop but she would not stop and continued to stroke me. Now my dick was straining and I started to get really worried. Then she started screaming...blood was coming out of my dick.

Long story short, she started crying and finally stopped. The bleeding continued for a few minutes (only small amounts). Since yesterday, peeing still hurts. She thought I wouldn't be stupid enough to proceed with putting my limp dick in a snuggly fitting bottle.

TL;DR I fucked up my dick by putting it in a bottle.

**Edit**: So my girlfriend saw the post and says she's embarrassed and wants me to take it down.

If you come back here to check, no I'm not taking it down, I am the one with the sore dick and no one can tell from the story that it is us because we told no one (well I hope you didn't). Sorry, I'm keeping it up. See you at 8.",tifu
TIFU by gluing my ass cheeks together before a long awaited date,"So there is this girl who lives a state away from me, and she had been planning to come visit me for three months. The plan was for her to come over when I got off work at 930am. 

I had worked three overnights in a row and I didn't have time to clean my apartment or get myself ready for her visit in the days prior due to being exhausted and/or at work.

Flash forward to this morning. I get off work around 825 and have an hour to get home and get ready before she gets there. 

I made it home and had 30 mins to spare. I decided that at most I needed 5 mins to shower so I figured I had time to clean up a little bit. As I'm finishing cleaning, about to get in the shower, she texts me and says she will be 15-20 minutes late. (This is where the cascading failures begin).

15-20 mins isn't a lot of time, but I thought it was enough to get my downstairs trimmed up, just in case things got physical. 

At first I tried to use an electric razor and it was going pretty well. It quickly turned to shit and cut my right nut twice in like 10 seconds. I decided that there is no way I could finish this without my manhood looking like a murder scene. 

I was panicking and had no idea what to do, seeing as she'd be there in less than 10 minutes and my undercarriage was in shambles. I went to put my razor away under the sink and noticed a box of self waxing strips that my friend had left behind when she was helping me wax my back. Perfect.

I didn't have time to read the directions, so I ripped to strips open and place them both into the middle of the jungle down there. I went to pull the first strip off and was greeted with extreme resistance and searing pain. Once again, I was too committed to not finishing and time was running out. I made the decision to rip the second strip off and just jump in the shower and hope that the encounter didn't turn physical.

As soon as I go to wash the wax from my nether regions I realize that an enormous amount of extremely sticky wax is still all over my crack. I frantically try every soap I had in my shower to get it off. I even tried to use a coffee ground face mask (that was unpleasant).

At this point, somehow the wax sticky factor had quadrupled and I was 2 minutes away from her arrival. 

I said fuck it and dried off and got dressed. 

She called me to say she was here and I got up to answer the door, when I realized that my boxers were stuck to my ass and that my ass cheeks were firmly stuck together. No time to figure it out now. 

We chatted for a while and things ended up moving into a physical direction. She could tell that I was wincing in pain when I moved around and she kept asking what was wrong. I played it off as muscle cramps.

This worked fine until she went to take off my boxers and could feel the resistance of the wax glue from my cheeks and crack.

She immediately looked concerned and I had no choice but to tell her what had gone down moments before her arrival. It has been a long time since I've been that embarrassed. 
 
The kicker is that once she stopped hysterically laughing at me, she pointed out that the wax kit comes with after wax removal wipes that I had failed to see during my frantic decision to wax in the first place.


TL,DR: I accidentally glued my ass cheeks together with a cheap self waxing kit, moments before a girl came over and I couldn't get the wax off my ass before she got there.

Edit: sorry y'all, I fell asleep after typing this. Didn't know so many people needed closure. I was successful in the mission with ""my rear flank exposed."" My ass cheeks got stuck to the sheets more than a few times and more than a few more hairs were removed that way, but all in all it went relatively well considering the circumstances.

Edit 2: changed the infamous ""his"" to the proper pronoun. Sorry to ruin the conspiracy theories

Edit 3: yes, for all of those interested, we had sex and I am seeing her again today. Also, I was talking to my best friend on Snapchat during the whole process and have a video of my reaction to the first strip being removed. I can post the link if anyone wants proof this happened

TIFU by ripping my anus open,"
The following events transpired yesterday. Spent last night in A&E, on hardly any sleep and some pretty strong painkillers, so apologies for any mistakes here.

Me and my girlfriend are trying to lose weight, and so for the past few months we have been eating super clean. Salads, quinoa, lean meats, etc. (very few carbs). Lost some weight, gained some muscle from working out too. Very happy with our progress.

Because we had been so disciplined and it was my birthday, we decided to treat ourselves to our previously weekly treat of takeout. A huge pizza, fries, and nachos each (I know, hence why we needed to lose weight), washed down with soda. 

We went to bed feeling very full and happy, if a little guilty.

I awoke a few hours later with intense stomach cramps. I could feel a ball of pizza nacho fries forming in the pit of my stomach and could tell it was not going to be pretty coming out. I waited till morning to go to the bathroom (small apartment, light sleeper gf), and as soon as I sat down on the crapper and pushed, I felt the most intense pain in my anal sphincter. Like it was being pulled apart from every angle. My girlfriend, who I had woken up by screaming, was now banging on the bathroom door thinking I was being murdered.

The worst part was that I couldn't exactly pinch this bad boy off, as the seal had been broken and my 'pincher' was now severely compromised. So I pushed through the pain, and could feel the ripping worsen with each push as this dry, fibrous monster made it's way out of my asshole. After about 25 minutes I had birthed the hellsnake. I only wish I had taken a photo as this thing was a sight to behold.

A painful car journey and 3 hour wait later, the doctor said I had the worst anal fissures he had ever seen. Apparently the turd was so fat and hard it'd literally ripped my asshole open in multiple places.

Sitting is agony, they itch and burn like hell and I can feel a second boulder pushing its way into my lower intestine. 

For all you sickos:

Dimensions: Difficult to say. Closer to Randy's first record attempt than I would be comfortable disclosing.

Courics: I don't know, I forgot to contact the European Fecal Standards team for verification. I would say more than one, less than four.

Color: Dark. I drink a lot of coffee.

Texture: Like a sock filled with broken marbles. 

TL;DR Avoided bad food for months, gorged on pizza and nachos, gave birth to a baby sized turd that ripped my anal cavity open on its way out, resulting in the worst anal fissures my doctor had ever seen. AMA

Edit: I'm sorry Reddit, I didn't take a photo. I wish I did. I wish I could go back in time and fix this...wait, no I don't. I don't want this to turn into a Reddit fable where my compromised pincher is being spread between the dark corners of the web for the rest of time, so no I will not be squatting over a mirror and taking a picture of my anus. Sorry. I also love my girlfriend too much to ask her to get in there with a camera; there's no use in two people being traumatized by this.

For all those sending get well messages and asking for updates: thank you sincerely. My girlfriend got over her anxiety and collected a cornucopia of stool softeners, numbing sprays, ice packs, and everything else imaginable. Thank you all for the advice. She and the chemist shared a laugh when she showed her the story. How nice...",tifu

TIFU by scratching my back.,"The following events actually happened today.

For the last year or so, I have been diligently growing this little bump on my back. Call it a wart, a cyst, whatever. Right between my shoulder blades, just a little left of my spine, and *riiiiiight* on the threshold of the 'can't-reach-it-without-a-friend' zone.

It's nothing to worry about, I swear. Just last night, after a shower, my girlfriend was giving me the ole ""You should really see a doctor yadda yadda I want you to be healthy yadda yadda"" spiel. I just told her, in my best Schwarzenegger, ""It's not a tumor."" And it most certainly is not. It's just this weird little bump under my skin, no bigger than a marble, or a walnut if you're using the metric system. It doesn't hurt or anything. I've actually grown quite fond of it. Until today...

I was at work, awaiting my coworker to relieve me from my shift around 5 o clock. He shows up, I'm shooting the shit with him, and casually scratching my own back. Try to imagine this as appearing ""casual.""

Right as my coworker is telling me about his weekend plans I feel my BackBuddy^TM gurgle beneath my fingers and change in shape. I remove my hand from my work shirt and see what appears to be a small amount of mashed potatoes smeared across my fingertips. Curiosity and mild confusion mingle upon my face until the stench hits.

Suddenly my coworker's weekend plans to visit his long-lost blahblahblah didn't seem so intriguing once I experienced the smell of death itself.

Perhaps you have never smelled the distinct odor of pus. I imagine war veterans are familiar with the harrowing scent. I, for one, have never smelled something so vile or corrosive. God, I can get a whiff of it right now as I type. It smells worse than your high school bully's diarrhea. It is the smell of hatred and doom. That smell is *pure evil*.

Immediately, I bolt for the bathroom. Alarm bells going in my head and I'm thinking, ""IT'S HAPPENING!"" I reach the public bathroom door, lock it shut (thank god for singular restrooms) and stand in front of the mirror before I pull my shirt off over my head. My back, fortunately, does not resemble a crime scene like I'd expected. I decide to be a gross human being and squeeze my back knob to see what happens. It changes in shape, feels like some air bubbles are being released(?), and I wipe my back clean with some paper towels. By now the bathroom smells like...not my problem -- it's the end of my shift!

I pull my shirt on, leave the bathroom, clock out, and head home. Driving home was peaceful enough, with the windows down of course. I was careful not to deface the delicate upholstery of my vehicle with my bodily excretions.

Upon arriving home, I disrobe immediately inside the front door. Shirt off, pants down. Leave the socks. Walk to the bathroom. Look in the mirror. Game face. I squeeze that itty-bitty protuberance with as much might as I can muster at this angle behind my back.

*Pus confetti.*

Ribbons of pus. Stream all over my bathroom. The wall. The mirror. The fucking ceiling. My eyes are watering. My jaw is clenched. *Everything* is clenched. The bump is literally making tiny squeaking sounds as I squeeze it mightily. It may have been screams. I'm not kidding. I'm salivating like a hungry animal who digs the pain for some reason. The smell is offending my ancestors. And at this point I'm fairly certain my girlfriend is going to leave me once she sees/ smells this biological catastrophe.

I jump into the hottest shower I have ever taken. I need to grieve. My relationship is dead, for certain. My BackBuddy^TM is vanquished. I don't really know what to do.

Upon exiting the shower, I see I have a text waiting from me on my phone. It's from my boss.

""This is embarrassing, but plz explain to me what happened in the company restroom before u left today. Customers have complained about the smell.""

With this picture attached: http://imgur.com/a/gwJsA

**TL;DR Accidentally ruptured a cyst on my back. Made pus spaghetti all over my workplace bathroom walls and got called out. Forever haunted by the mere stench.**

EDIT: Still waiting for the girlfriend to come home. The smell lingers like a ghost and seems to follow me around the house, no matter how many candles I've lit. Maybe it's in my nose forever. Dear god.

EDIT2: I still don't know what to tell my boss. Do I deny it was me? Do I explain myself? God he must be imagining the absolute worst. Am I going to lose my job holy shit

EDIT3: Still have my job, hallelujah. I feigned ignorance to my boss and then snuck a bottle of industrial bleach and a box of gloves into the restroom first thing the next morning. Badda bing badda boom. What bodily fluids? TO CLARIFY: I was not initially aware I had left a mess in a public place. I would never intentionally expose innocent people to my bodily sin, don't be ridiculous. My fuck-up resides in these simple factors: (1) it was the end of my shift and I was rushing to leave, (2) I was probably in a state of mild shock tbh, and (3) I never would have thought to check for back shrapnel on *the opposite wall of the restroom*. In fact, I wasn't even aware I was capable of that feat until I destroyed our nice bathroom at home. 

Speaking of which, my girlfriend still loves me. She's thoroughly disturbed by the way I anonymously read my own post to her, as if this shit *didn't* go down right in her nice clean bathroom. But she quickly caught on and had a good laugh. Turns out she still has that gag reflex after all. 

EDIT4: Apparently some of you are concerned about the timeline of this event. /r/TIFU has rules about submitting posts involving bodily emissions during the week. So I resubmitted over the weekend. Simple copy-paste jobbie. My bad. 

EDIT5: AND ANOTHER THING. I'm aware this was a gross story. Yes, OP is disgusting. Thank you. But if I can't make some of you internet fuckers lose your appetites then what can I do?? You're welcome. ",tifu
TIFU by going permanently deaf after intense sit ups,"I was on my last exercise, which was just your regular old sit up. I get to the point where I can barely finish a full sit up, pushing myself hard to finish the last few, when I feel a pop in my left ear. My ear starts ringing. Nothing else was wrong with me though, so I shrugged it off, quit my workout, and went to sleep about an hour later.

It's 6 am when I wake up. I look at the time, but I notice everything around me seems to be spinning. I also realize the sound of every movement I make only seems to reach my right ear. Something was definitely wrong, and I immediately remembered the pop in my ear the night before. At this point I'm not *that* worried yet.

But I start googling my symptoms, as you do. I usually don't get too affected by all these ""*you have cancer*"" or ""*you're going to die!*"" diagnoses you always find, but this time it struck me that everything definitely pointed to a serious issue: a fractured round or oval window. This can cause serious hearing loss. By now, I also found out that every movement I make causes intense vertigo and nausea. This is the point I start panicking a bit.

After a visit to the doctor, a nice morning of throwing up from nausea, and then a hospital visit, I'm told that it is probably exactly what I thought. Apparently it is extremely rare, but this can happen during a workout. I'm given steroids for a higher chance of recovery and get sent home. Two days later I get a call from the doctor, asking if I can have surgery the next day. She explained it didn't feel right to her and she wanted to diagnose the problem and possibly fix it as soon as possible.

I had the surgery, and everything seemed healthy. She explained that this meant it was likely indeed a fracture in the oval window. Fractures can be so small, it's possible you will never locate them. During surgery, she something to the oval window to increase the likelyhood of recovery, but that's all she could do.

Now, after more than a month of recovering from the vertigo I can do basically everything I used to be able to. Hearing in my left ear is gone. I've been told that it's very unlikely to recover. My balance is still somewhat off but I've been told I'll get used to that. I'm already mostly used to it. Hearing with just one ear has many downsides, and don't get me wrong it fucking sucks, but I've learned to live with it already. Well, other than the fact that I am now somewhat terrified of the thought of this happening to my right ear as well.

Now what irrationally stings the most about this whole ordeal. I'm a big Linkin Park fan. I had even pre-ordered the collector's edition of their last album. This story happened the day before the Linkin Park concert in Amsterdam that I had tickets to. I obviously couldn't go. It's a selfish thought, but it really fucking stings now that I know it was the last opportunity to see them live.

*****

**TL;DR
I was working out using bad form and breathing techniques, feel a pop in my left ear, wake up deaf the next morning with extreme vertigo. Had surgery and medicine, but to no avail. Am deaf in my left ear now.**

*****

Edit: wording and spelling

Edit 2: some people asking what the TIFU was... I mean I literally did sit ups so hard and with wrong breathing techniques  that I put too much pressure on my head and ripped a vital part of my left ear. I think that counts, even if some bad luck is required as well.

***Edit 3 (now bolded because this is important): To those saying ""Another reason not to work out"" and actually mean it: I was incredibly dumb. Please remember that. I held my breath, which is dumb. I kept going when my body barely could, which is dumb. I strained all my muscles to get those last few sit ups out, which is dumb. Etc. Working out doesn't cause this. Being a dumb fuck who doesn't know what he's doing causes this.***

Edit 4: Thanks for the 2x gold! Don't really know what to say. Really appreciate it!

And another Edit, number 5: FRONTPAGE! :o I really appreciate all the kind words. Everyone wants to give me advice and help me, and that's amazing. The internet isn't always a shitty place after all.

UPDATE to AITA for not teaching a skill to my oldest son that I taught his siblings,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d1r1vr/aita_for_not_teaching_a_skill_to_my_oldest_son

I offered the two best options to my oldest which a few days after I posted during dinner.

The first option was work as a salaried employee for his brothers' company for a few years while he learns the trade and then buy in for a partnership in the company. I would've sold him my share for a very fair price. This was the only way his brothers were willing to join the company. He rejected it immediately.

The second option was an apprenticeship I setup with someone I knew and respected. Unfortunately, this was based in Alaska and he rejected that as well, which I expected.

He then said a lot of hurtful things about me and his mother. I gave in and said I would teach him. Some people did suggest this on the first post.

He took all my tools and material the next few days and moved it to his garage. I've been going over to his garage workshop everyday for a few hours to try and teach him.

It's not going that great I have to admit.

I'm physically not in the best shape and he's getting frustrated by it. 

I'm just going to keep going with this and hopefully it'll get easier as he learns more.

I appreciate everyone's input on the first post.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by sending nudes to my employee group chat.,"TLDR at the bottom- 

Well I recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). With that being said I'm pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. I also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

We have a GroupMe for the store I work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
The previous night I had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that I was with at the time. No biggie right? 
The next morning I had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. Noon rolls around and I needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue I was having with a computer I was working on. 
I typed what I needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as I clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, I hit send without thinking and go on about my day. I should also probably say that by this time I was working alone and closing so no one else was around. The customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left I went to check my phone and saw I had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first I thought he was just calling me about the question I had, while the phone was ringing, I went back to look at the groupme, to my horror I CLICKED NOT JUST A PICTURE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THE WHOLE DAMN VIDEO. My heart dropped, instantly when I realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my ""intentions"" where with the video and that he's never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. I tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. Lol on the bright side the coworker I had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 


TLDR: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out I send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end!

AITA for expecting a full refund (rather than the 90% one offered) from our wedding photographer?,"My wife and I hired a photographer for our wedding for $2,000, and we were eagerly awaiting our photos. Fairly recently I was contacted by the photographer, apologizing profusely, and telling me he's not going to be able to get us the photos due to a fire that ravaged his entire house.

I snooped on his social media profiles to double-check that this was true and not just an excuse, and it is; he posted pictures of the burnt-down house. He also posted that he has homeowner's insurance that will cover it, and has posted some pics of him staying at his sister's, so fortunately he isn't on the street or totally screwed. Still a pretty shitty situation, though.

Here's the catch, though: he's only offering us a 90% refund ($1800) instead of the full $2000 one. He says the differential is due to the ""huge amount of time he put into editing, the 5 hours he spent shooting at the wedding, and the hour-and-a-half round trip he drove to shoot.""

TIFU by blasting diarrhea in a girl's face,"In 2012, I led a team of volunteers on a mission trip to a rural part of the heart of Brazil, and what happened back in those jungles still haunts me to this day.

 We landed in Manaus Brazil, our team consisted of 15 people all about the same age (25 - 19), myself included. Then we took two of those minibuses out to some rural villages where there was no running water at all. Fortunately we did not have to sleep on the ground because some German missionaries had built a rudimentary concrete church building in the 1950's.

I've lived most of my life in Canada, but I have been on several mission trips throughout my life, so I like to pride myself on having a stomach of iron. No Hershey squirts in a foreign country for this guy. However, this trip was different. It must have been undercooked pork from the night we arrived in the village, because pretty much everyone got diarrhea the next day. 

We may have been in a church built by Germans, but there was no running water, no air conditioning or anything of the sort. However, the people of the village built an outhouse about 50 yards away. This thing was nasty too, flies were all over it in the day time because it was pretty much a pit. And when it rained, which it did often, the palm thatched roof leaked. 

So the night of the ""incident."" It was about 2 AM and pouring rain when I woke up feeling like I was going to explode, I had puked that night but this felt different. My stomach was making all manner of noises a healthy stomach shouldn't make. I got up and put some pants on as quietly as possible so as to not wake anyone else, tiptoed downstairs to the main area of the church. That's when I realised, whether I was ready for it or not, my sphincter was about to dump its contents in about 15 seconds. 

I sprinted out church doing the widest ""I got poo in my pants"" run I could to extend the time of the anal evacuation. I could barely see where I was going because it was raining so hard. The genius part of my brain had me already undoing my jeans as I was running. I also worked out in my head that I was going to be able to make it if I dropped my pants, opened the door and turned around all in the same moment upon entry. I did exactly that, but it wasn't enough. Mid air through the jump I shot a gas charged explosive into the outhouse, completely missing the seat. I kind of stood there in a moment of defeat, then heard a blood curdling scream. 

I turned around and saw one of the volunteers absolutely coated in excrement. My excrement. She had gotten the same stomach bug I had, must have woken up before me with the same horrible thing. Only she had made it, and I didn't.

Needless to say, she flew out back home the next day.

That was the worst feeling I have ever felt in my life. I would rather poop my pants in front of a crowd while giving a speech, than relive the embarrassment of that night. 

I couldn't imagine what went through that poor girl's head as the door flew open, a random dude jumped out of the jungle, then pooped all over her. If you're reading this, I hope you forgive me.

Edit: Due to popular request, here is the aftermath:

I stood there with my jaw floored because of the situation my rectum had just created. After she stopped screaming, the girl started crying. 

I felt so incredibly bad at this point. I had nothing give her to wipe her face off. So she kept trying to wipe everything off her with just her hands. You know when you're in deep when your heartbeat becomes the loudest thing in your ears. 

As she ran out of the outhouse crying, I kept saying how sorry I was, then I realized my pants were still halfway down. 

I was left just listening to the rain in an outhouse that smelled so incredibly bad I almost puked after I had come to my senses. I went out and washed in the rain and wiped with some leaves I found.

When I got back the girl had woken up most of the team. The other girls were helping her wash her face with their water bottles. One look from all the girls, and I knew she had told them exactly what happened. I had messed up so bad. She had vomited all over the floor of the church, probably because she realized how covered she was.

The next morning I had apologized to her, and she sort of acknowledged me. I'm not sure how far sorry goes for taking a dump on someone's face. She left that day, and I felt like I had never truly made it up to her.

The feeling I get every time I sit on the pot is the worst part, as I am constantly reminded I have pooped on someone's face.

Tl;dr I got the worst stomach bug of my life. Then I went on a life or death sprint to the outhouse, didn't make it, and coated the current occupant in feces, which happened to be a girl.",tifu

"Husband ran up 60k debt behind my back. How will this play out in divorce court? (Ontario, Canada)","Husband an I are mid-30s, we have a 3yo and a second on the way. 

We've never had a ton of money, but we manage. I worked retail to put him through school, then went back to school myself. We have about 20k student loan debt between us, and about 6k in credit card debt. Our mailbox is a good distance away, so generally My husband picks up the mail as he drives our only car to work, while I take the train. 

I handle all the financials, pay all the bills, make sure we have an emergency fund and there's always money for groceries and gas. I also make sure we have money for entertainment. We do it this way because my husband will spend every dime he gets as soon as it hits his hands. You could give him 1000$ and it would be gone tomorrow, and he would have no idea how he spent it. While we don't live poor, we do live well within our means, and I do strive to make sure our debt is getting paid down, and am paying about 400$/month on it. My husband agreed to all of this btw. 

Monday my husband dropped off the mail for me to go through. I always open the mail because I do all the banking. Tucked into the folds of a flyer was a letter from a bank we don't use addressed to my husband. Figuring it was some junk mail, I opened it to recycle it. It was not junk mail. 

It was a statement for a credit card in my husbands name, with nearly 10k on it. When I confronted my husband, he admitted he had several cards I didn't know about. All together nearly *sixty thousand dollars* in debt. I made him show me the online statements and it's all junk food, liquor store, online gaming micro transactions, etc. Just petty bullshit with no real value. He was literally packing a lunch everyday, then tossing it at work to eat at Wendy's or the local pub. Some months were 1000$ plus per month of debt being racked up. When one card maxed out, he'd open another one and keep going. He was borrowing money from his mom to keep collections at bay, and owes her nearly 4000$ too. He was hiding it from me by controlling the mail and removing the letters before giving me the mail. He missed one because it was stuck in a flyer. 

So all of that to say, I'm definitely getting a divorce. I took our daughter and moved in with my parents. He's alternating between threatening to destroy my life in court, begging me to give him another chance, and claiming its all my fault because I wouldn't let him have free reign on our money. So I missed my aunts funeral because we couldn't afford the plane ticket, while he spent the equivalent in Whoppers and Doritos in 2 months, but it's *my fault*. 

Anyway so my question is, I know debt accumulated during a marriage is shared, but am I really going to be saddled with 30,000$ in debt that I was lied to about, and saw no benefits from? This isn't shared debt like our car loan or even our student loans, where I agreed to and benefitted from it. I'm just hoping someone can clear up where I stand.",legaladvice
[UPDATE][NC] Boyfriend's mom threatening to call the cops over my heroin use...I don't use heroin,"Original thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7mglxj/nc_boyfriends_mom_threatening_to_call_the_cops/

6 months ago I asked for advice on my boyfriend's crazy mom threatening to call the cops on me/have me committed to rehab because of dry patchy skin on my inner elbows that apparently looked like track marks. You guys advised me that she didn't have the power to do anything to me legally, so that was a big relief. To take the pressure and scrutiny off our relationship, my boyfriend and I pretended to break up on social media and my boyfriend told his mom he had dumped me to focus on school. She was pleased, we were seemingly off the hook, and we were able to continue to date fairly easily (her being in another state) albeit somewhat secretively without risking her pulling his tuition out from under him.

I wanted to provide an update since things have come to a very sad and tragic conclusion that no one anticipated. My boyfriend's mom died from an accidental fall last weekend. She was an older woman—late 50's—but we didn't think she was particularly fragile and were both surprised by what sounded like a fairly short fall being fatal.

My boyfriend especially is dealing with some messy and complicated emotions. grieving both the mom he had and the mom he wish he had. I am doing my best to be supportive but I'm struggling a bit to be gutted by the death of someone who was only ever malicious towards me.

Apparently she had a considerable amount of money that she said in her will that she would be giving to her son, my boyfriend. I don't know all of the details yet because I didn't want to pry about finances at a time like this. But it's actually kind of awful because she never did find out we were still together, and I doubt she would have given my boyfriend the money if she knew. So even though I know it's horrible of her to be so manipulative with money I still kind of feel like scum. I am also worried that her will has conditions in it that will make my boyfriend jump through hoops to get anything from the estate, including something stipulating that he won't get anything if he's with me...which I honestly would not be surprised if that was in there, given what I know about her.

So...I don't really know what the future holds at the moment. It's still a shock that this has even happened.

tl;dr - My boyfriend had a crazy overbearing helicopter mom who threatened to have me locked up for nonexistent drug use. She has just died in an accident and I kind of feel terrible just for existing right now.",legaladvice

I did speak to a lawyer for 30 minutes who said I didn't have much to fight for. The ""online"" courses were not online. It meant my normal classes that were lecture based could provide me info vis email. It wasn't a set up online course and 4 of my 5 professors didn't have any way to provide online lecture info. And even so, only one class provided me resources. The dean did not provide any info even after emails from me asking for it.

I was banned from campus following allegations against me. I was accused of sexual misconduct and assault charges. The allegations not only never happened but I have never even met this person for longer than 5 minutes at a party.

I was brought into the Dean's office with officers in the room who showed me the charges. I told them I had no idea what they were coming from and I barely know this person. They still issued a no trespassing issue until ""further investigation"".

I was not given any chance to take classes or reach out to any professors. I am a senior and about to graduate. They reached out to me with an option to take classes online for classes with lecture only curriculum. They only gave me info for one class. Then a week later they lifted my no contact ban based on new info. And another week later they entirely lifted my ban due to the person saying they completely lied and the allegations we're not true. Despite this I am still ""under investigation"".

I missed too much class to reasonably still complete. Three full weeks of missed senior level classes. I had to drop out due to this condition.

I was also let go at my prestigious internship because they only hire full time students. 

Because of this I have no school and no job.

The university refused any refund to me upon request and their response was ""the actions were necessary due to the severity of the accusation"" despite never hearing my side.

My wife is going to have sex with other men,"Title says it all. My wife, Beth, and I are 50. 3 kids last just graduated and started new job in May. Been married 27 years. 2 kids are married the daughter is 5 months pregnant with 1 st grandchild. This past Friday family celebrated  Beth's 50 th. She was stay at home mom until about 13 years ago. She started a career has done great. We are almost equal in pay. We are not rich, still a mortgage but life is comfortable.

Saturday I was finishing my breakfast. She sits down across from me and says""I need to tell you domething"". She pauses. I am like okay what is it? Take a deep breath and says ""I am going to start having sex with other men"". I just stare waiting for a smile to crack. None. I ask her to repeat it. She does still no smile. Now I am WTF does that mean. She goes on to explain for the last 10 years she has had the pact with herself, the kids will be gone, job is good, our life is good, she wants to do this for herself. Again WTF. We were married in our early 20's, only partners, she feels she missed out. Now that she is 50 she wants this new life. She wants the marriage opened up. I asked if I had any say. Nope. She hoped I would look elsewhere also. She wants to stay married.

Now I am going apeshit. I am yelling, crying, sobbing, all the emotions of betrayal. I asked if I did anything to cause this. No all her.  I left the house to drive nowhere. I called her best friend from childhood, Clare. She confirmed they had talked about this off and on over the years. They have a group of friends they do their girls night out etc. 2 are single, 4 married. The 2 singles delight the group with their exploits. Clare says they all have a yearning but Beth is the only one following through. I should point out I will be talking to Clares husband, we are good friends.

So I have no one to talk to about this. Parents on both sides are alive in their late 70's. I called my brother 1000 miles away. He was blown away, no advice. I did call a  lawyer on Monday. Will meet next week. In the mean time he advised not to move out, change locks, or change living arrangements as that could come back to bite me. He said take lots if notes, and above all no physical confrontation. That would not be a problem.

Sunday I went in for round 2. I asked if she was going to date these guys, no just sex. How were they to meet. A girlfriend was to set her up on sites.  I was worried about her safety. Girl friends  would be close by on initial meetup. They would also know where and when the hook up would take place. They would know when and where the hookups take place.

I know there are some weird ass posts on Reddit. I need to Google half the things people write with all the acronyms,  initials and just plain different lifestyles.

Can I have a girl sign a contract that either forces her to get an abortion or gets me off the hook for child support?,"No. You cannot.

We get multiple questions a week with guys asking if they can write up an enforceable contract that forces the woman they slept with to get an abortion if she gets pregnant. In addition, many of these people also want to know if they can have her sign a contract making it impossible for her to collect child support.

If you don't want to worry about unintended pregnancy, don't have sex. If you are going to be an adult and have a sexual relationship, you also need to be an adult and understand that children can result from your actions.

EDIT: Here is a short excerpt from a user below as to way this is not possible, as written by a Wisconsin state judge. Find the whole thing [here](http://www.whdlaw.com/Publications/Dodd_WisconsinJournalOfFamilyLaw_5-12.pdf).

>In sum, the judge found that family matters are matters of public interest, and the consequences of family contracts (and the court's decisions regarding them) are more significant to society than those of other contracts.
Accordingly, the public interest must always be taken into account because the impairment or breach of family responsibilities generally results in injury to the public wholly apart from the effect upon the parties immediately concerned.",legaladvice

I Wish Liberals Didn't Treat Black People Like Handicapped Children,"I'm black and I despise racism because I've literally felt it in my everyday life, but I accept that as an interpersonal interaction instead of something like ""witnessing the true colors of all white people.""

I don't fear for my life everyday, I try to enjoy everyday of my life without this perpetuated online dichotomy interfering with it. and I don't feel comfortable having a widespread narrative that I DO fear for my life, especially from someone who's just catering to black people so that they don't ""drag her for not acknowledging her privilege.""

TIFU by making people think I'm in an incestuous relationship with my mother (NSFW),"So today my mother and I did our weekly shopping. I accompany her most weeks as it's usually the only time we get to spend each other at the moment with our schedules and everything else.

It began as a normal journey and everything was going absolutely fine until we reached the end of our list and began to unload everything onto the conveyor, we had everything we needed except some batteries that my mother had forgotten to write on the list and only just remembered as we were going through the checkouts. Not a problem though as they were on a stand at the end of an aisle. I offer to go and grab the batteries enthusiastically enough that I mishear when she tells me which type of battery she wants. 

I had heard the word Duracell but not the type, and so I don't go back and ask what she wants, I wait until I am by the battery display, turn around and see my mum on the other side of a busy crowd of people. It's Christmas so of course people are everywhere.

First off I really want to thank everyone who took the time to provide insightful and thoughtful opinions. My post had a lot of concerned people so I just wanted to update anyone who cares. 

My husband came home on his own accord this morning. He was extremely apologetic and immediately sat me down and told me he wanted to explain everything leading to his outburst. 

He said that at work, him and his friends had been discussing their sex lives, and he had let slip that he was not receiving any blowjobs.

He claims that his friends started insulting him for being weak willed and not more stern with what he wanted. He says they encouraged him to confront me. 

Apperently his friends put the idea in his head that without oral sex, his sex life wasn't ""legitimate"". 

He told me that he really felt like he was missing out and that this is what lead to him yelling at me.

He called in sick from work so he could stay home with me all day, we talked a lot about the future and he agreed to go to marriage counseling or see a sex counselor together if that is what I wanted. 

I haven't completely forgiven him yet, but it's just nice to have him back home.  ",AmItheAsshole

My [20] fiance's [27m] behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship,"So I've been with my fiance for 3 nearly 4 years and I've always known that he enjoys casually playing video games. I'm not really a 'gamer' myself but I haven't had a problem with it until now. A few months ago he started playing an online video game that's a battle royale type game where you have teams and compete against other players. At first he would just play it in the evening after work like any other game for an hour or two and then we'd watch TV or a movie while I did schoolwork. However, he then began to play it from the time he got home from work at around 4pm until 2 or 3 in the morning. I wasn't a huge fan of this because it's a very loud game and he would yell into the headset to communicate with other players which was very distracting as I was doing schoolwork and we live in a small flat so sleeping was difficult. He has started started acting very differently while playing this particular game, for example he screams and swears at other players on his team if they mess up in the game or if they lose. He will also argue with other players over the messaging system and say really vulgar stuff. I mentioned being upset once b/c he was saying stuff about rape, using the n-word, etc and he told me to calm down as he was ""just joking"" and that's what everyone does.

&#x200B;

three-ish weeks ago I came home during a break between classes and he was home during a workday. He told me his job cut back his hours to only three days a week. Since then he has devoted all of his spare time to gaming. I am in nursing school and also work so I'm gone most of the day, we have one day a week that neither of us work or go to school. We used to go places or run errands on those days but now if I can even get him out of the house he gets antsy and has to rush home to play so he doesn't ""miss anything"". He also expects me to continue doing a majority of the housework (which I have always done) like cleaning, laundry, and preparing meals. I told him I can't realistically go to school, work, and clean and cook. He will call me repeatedly at work or in class begging me to stop off on the way home and get him chips or beer. I'm pretty sure he lives off of crap junkfood because none of the healthy meals I prep seem to get eaten by him. Junkfood is expensive and since he's barely working I am trying to shop cheaply so we can pay our rent and other expenses.

&#x200B;

The final straw for me is the way he reacts when he loses in the game--he has started throwing stuff, screaming, swearing, and lashing out at me. He has broken a lamp, knocked a leg off the coffee table, and broken multiple glasses. He broke his headset and used my amazon account to order a new one. I have tried to talk to him about this and asked him to either find another way to cope or play in an area of the home with less breakable stuff in it and he told me that I don't understand how it feels to lose an important game. He accused me of being controlling and abusive towards him which was very hurtful. He also is in a group chat with the people on his team and I once saw him (i looked over his shoulder while he was chatting, which was shitty I know this) text in their group instagram chat that I was a ""nag"" and ""always bitching at him"". Even worse, a lot of the players on his team seem to be teenage boys or girls so I doubt they understand what it's like to be a in a longterm relationship. I have tried multiple times to tell him that the video game obsession is too much for me to handle, and yesterday suggested couples counseling. He has pretty much ignored me every time or promised that he'll be less aggressive on the game/limit his time. I almost dread going back to our flat bc I know he'll be gaming all night. I am aware this sounds like a very stupid problem to have, but I feel a bit like I'm living with a teenage boy.",relationship_advice

"AITA for telling an anorexic girl to ""stay the fuck away from my girlfriend""","I've been dating my girlfriend for almost three years now (M18) (F17). Since she's considered a minor medically she was put into a youth anorexia program for her eating disorder. Shes been doing really well, improving a ton and making much faster progress than anyone there, (she knows and wants to get better but is still really mentally fragile). A girl was admitted last week for severe eating disorder, I'm taking fights nurses, refuses to eat and threatens to harm herself if they make her eat. My girlfriend told me that the girls been anorexic since she was 9, she's 17 now and has made zero progress according to her parents (she overheard, they share a room).

A few days ago my girlfriend mentioned that she's been trying to make friends with the new girl but she makes her severely uncomfortable. Basically telling her that she looks perfect the way she was and that gaining weight was going to make her unattractive to me. Shes also been telling her things like ""Why do you want to get better, you look so healthy"" and ""Wow your boyfriend must have loved your body, it's a shame"".

I eventually mentioned to a nurse that my girlfriend should be moved out of that environment ASAP and was moved to a different room yesterday. A few hours ago I went to visit and the girl basically confronted me and told me that I was an asshole for taking away her friend. 

Things eventually escalated and I left off yelling at her to stay the fuck away from my girlfriend. 

Am I in the wrong? I don't know how anorexia effects people mentally and am not sure if she even realized what she was doing was wrong.

Edit for clarity: My girlfriend told me she doesn't want to be around the girl, her intentions on being friends ended the second she started being toxic to her.",AmItheAsshole

I (31M) am sterile. Fiancé (27F) miraculously got pregnant. Baby looks nothing like me. How do I address this?,"We had been trying to have a baby for a few years. Eventually we found out I was sterile. We accepted it and decided to hold off on trying so hard and said that we would figure out what I do in the future. Although we weren't trying, we were continuing to have sex obviously. One day she missed her period and we found out he was pregnant. I was so happy and I thought it was amazing. We joked about how as soon as we stopped trying she ends up pregnant. The doctor said that it was a miracle baby. 

The night that the baby was born I couldn't be happier. I was just happy to finally have a baby and so excited to take her home. After a few days of taking care of her, I couldn't help but notice that she was extremely pale. For reference, I am black and she is white. I figure she would eventually darken a little and I didn't want to overthink it. 

Then our friends came over and while the girls were inside we were outback drinking. They all mentioned that they didn't want to worry me or to cause drama but asked if I ever thought my fiancé would cheat on me. I thought I was very weird and then I knew exactly where they were going with it. I said no and we talked about our concerns with the babies skin tone. However I still tried to brush it off thinking that the baby would get darker after a while. 

Now the baby is 5 months and I can't help but question if she's mine everyday. She has very fine hair. No kinks or curls, just bone straight hair. I know she's a baby but I have been around plenty of babies who still have natural curls. She is also still very pale. The thing that's been bothering me the most is that everyday she looks more and more Asian in the eyes. I don't mean to offend anyone at all but her eyes are just very stretched, they look nothing like mine. 

Is it wrong for me to be questioning my fiancé when this would have never crossed my mind before? Am I just being paranoid? How do I go about addressing this? Do I even say anything? My biggest fear is that the baby is somehow mine and she will be extremely hurt that I accused her of sleeping with someone else. I just don't know what to do. Please help me.

AITA: I ditched a girl 40 minutes from her house on our first date,"I know the title already sounds like i'm a major asshole, but there is a few more variables that need to be discussed before you make your decision. 

Also, this is a throwaway acct for obvious reasons

So I meet a girl on Tinder named ""Kim"" and we exchange a few messages before deciding to meet up for coffee.

The date is going OK, although it was a bit boring, we grabbed our cup of starbucks (i paid) we chatted for a bit and decided to drive to a cool little outdoor park to go for a walk. 

We drive around 30 mins to this park, listened to a bit of music on the way, still getting to know each other a bit and everything was going fine. 

I parked, we got out of the car and walked a bit, still chatting, nothing deep, but the usual what you do for work, hobbies etc etc.

I had to take a leak, so I go to the bathroom and when I walked out, I noticed she was talking to a guy and he was being very flirty and when I walked up to them, he asked who I was and she responded: ""oh he's just my friend hahaha"" and he said he wanted to grab her number to go out for a drink sometime. She was all too happy to give him the number and they hug with a kiss on the cheek before he leaves. 

At this point I was just over it. I wasn't that interested in her and if she's the type of person to show interest in another guy and exchange info in front of me I have no future with her.

I decided to make up some random excuse to get away from her and just got in my car and drove home. I didn't want to have to deal with her company for a 40 minute drive and was over it.

"Every night my (34F) husband (34M) takes one of our 3 children (1,3,4) for a two-hour drive. Should I be worried?","*UPDATE FOR CLARITY: I have tracked his GPS a few times.  They never lead to the same place but he usually is stopped for 1/2 an hour.   I went on google maps and don't recognize the places he's stopped at.  They aren't near anything special like a Grocery Store, Target, Fast Food.*     


My husband and I have been together for 10+ years. At times he can be weird in an only child way, but he's a very good guy.  And a hard worker.

&#x200B;

As our kids are close to going to bed, he's been saying that he wants to take one of them out for a drive.  We have a newborn that is teething , and sometimes it can be hard for the kids to sleep if she's crying.  And sometimes it can be hard if they're running around and she's trying to sleep (our 3 year old has a sensory disorder & 4 year old is on the spectrum.  It's more complex than the following but when I explained everything the 3 year old has a form of hyperactivity that is similar to ADHD and the 4 year old has Aspergers but neither can be diagnosed this early according to our doctors )   .

&#x200B;

The drives can last for 2-4 hours.

&#x200B;

But lately, I feel like he's been in his own head.  Not really talking after he gets home. I'm not sure if I'm stressing him out or doing something wrong. There's nothing that is glaring in terms of problems we might have outside of the normal financial stress of having 3 kids.

&#x200B;

I talked to the four year old last week to see what he & his father did on their drive.  He said just drive and talk until he went to sleep. I asked if they walked anywhere or left the car and he said no they just kept driving.

On Monday I asked the four year old where he & daddy went.  He said that they went to a building.  Not a house.  Not a store. A building.    My husband works from a converted garage behind our home so it's not his office.

&#x200B;

On Tuesday I asked my 3 year old the same question.  She said they stopped near an airport to watch airplanes (this is a small private airport for amateur pilots).

I just asked my husband what they did on their drive and he said that he just drive until the kid falls asleep.  He doesn't want them to get out of the car because the point is for them to go into a relaxing sleep.  I said that our 3 YO talked about an airport and he paused and said that maybe she was dreaming about it. Or saw a plane.

I'll be the first to admit I have trust & control issues ( I didn't grow up with a dad, let alone a good one)..  We've never had any issues in our marriage, but part of me worries if this is a sign of someone having an affair.  Maybe he waits for the kids to sleep to call someone? Or maybe he's being nice so I can go to sleep faster.",relationship_advice

TIFU By accidentally paying for a very unwanted happy ending,"Bit of backstory: I (21 M) got money for Christmas from my parents with the expectation it would be for experiences (concerts, trips, parks, etc) rather than material things. I'm an incredibly non-confrontational and generally awkward guy. I know the story sounds kind of unlikely and all I can do is promise it's true and hopefully looking at it through that lens might make it a bit more believable. Also this happened within the last 24 hours but not technically today.

So I decide to use a portion of the money to go and get a massage. I'm looking at the prices and most of them fall around $80-$100/hour, but in my cities Chinatown the rates are much lower, many offering $50/hour. In the back of my head a flittering of ""happy endings"" appears but I figure I don't care if that's how they get a good portion of their money, I'm just in it for a massage. Plus that's probably just locker room talk and doesn't happen much in real life. So I pick a place in Chinatown pretty much by chance, just wherever opened earliest as I had plans to go after I got off from work (night shift).

I take the subway down and get off to walk the 5ish blocks to the place. It's raining pretty decently and it's unseasonably warm, feels like spring despite being mid January which puts me in a great mood. Great way to go into this. I reach a certain street and realize I've gone too far. Weird I didn't see the sign, whatever I'll just double back. Get back to the street I originally turned off of onto this street and realize I must have missed it again. A quick google later and I got the exact address, it's about a block from me. Finally find the place and realize why I missed it, there's no sign stating it's a massage place and no distinctive feature that would even prompt you to think it was open to the public. Just a slate grey wall with a metal door and a small sign, about the size of my hand with the address on it. This is the first time I question whether I should just go to some other place, but the rain is starting to get through my light jacket and soak my clothes so whatever I go in. I land in a tiny little landing with a sign telling me to press the buzzer on the wall. I do and after a few seconds an elderly lady opens the door and motions me in. She speaks very little english but mentions how wet I am. I fumble through a quick introduction and she grabs a towel and hands it to me. I thank her and begin drying off, apparently not to her satisfaction as she takes the towel and begins to dry me off - a pretty uncomfortable experience. I look young for my age and she asks me how old I am. I say 21 and I can see the disbelief and note her drying me off is pretty belittling but I'm used to that kind of stuff so I brush it off. 

She leads me back to the massage room and I ask if I can use the restroom before it starts. She points me to a small restroom at the end of the hall. I'll spare that part but I notice there's listerine, tooth brushes, vaseline, etc. in the bathroom. By now I'm positive this place does happy ending type stuff but mostly unperturbed as I'm just looking for a massage. So I finish up and go back to the room and the elderly lady brings in my masseuse, a mid 30s lady wearing this horrendous lingerie. She speaks even less english than the elderly lady, like none at all. The elderly lady is talking to me but I can't figure out what she's trying to say. Finally I realize she's asking for the money. I hand her $50 (the price she had mentioned when I called earlier) and she says ""plus tip one hundred"". I'm sort of taken aback like how are you gonna ask for a tip double the original price. I tell her I was told 50 over the phone, she is very insistent on the 100 tip. By this point I understand what's going down more or less and I just come out with it. I say ""I'm just looking for a massage, right, no"" and do the handjob motion. She makes no motion that she acknowledged me so I repeat the statement. She keeps pressuring me ""don't you think she deserve tip? Why don't you want to give tip?"". Being a pushover I cave and say ""I've got $100"" and offer that. After a little more arguing she agrees to that. At this point I figure $100 still isn't an absurd price for an hour massage. 

With the payment out of the way, they leave the room and tell me to strip. Now I had gotten a massage once before and they had told me to strip and I did, only for her to return and tell me she didn't mean my underwear too so she left while I sheepishly put my underwear back on. This time I wasn't going to do the same thing. Plus if there was any doubt, I hoped me keeping my underwear on would clarify I was just here for the massage. The masseuse comes back in and I'm laying on the bed with the towel over my back (what I had done last time I got a massage). She motions for me to stand back up so I do and she gives me a questioning look and motions pulling off my underwear. I, for the third time do the ""no handjob"" bit but she mentions a shower so I think maybe for hygiene reasons/ relaxation they expect you to shower first, hence the two towels so I wrap the one around me and follow her to the shower. I go in and to my (minor at this point) surprise she follows me in. Pretty much before I can do anything she begins washing me and I'll admit it wasn't any more sexual than say a nurse washing someone and was pretty relaxing being showered so I just went with it and tried to get back into the mindset of relaxing. That finishes up and I follow her back into the original room. She motions for me to lie down and places the towel over my still naked back. Finally the massage begins and it's actually pretty decent. This goes on for in what were for sure the best 10 minutes I spent there.

At one point the massage stops and I hear some ruffling so I open my eyes and turn my head to her taking her top off. I figure this is where I draw the line so I tell her ""no no no put your shirt back on I'm just here for the massage"" but she doesn't understand. I motion to pull her shirt back up and she seems completely unfazed. She goes over to a bottle of listerine and gargles it in her mouth. It is just about the most bizarre experience I've ever had so I'm going between just shock in watching it and panic of like ""i'm about to get arrested for soliciting a prostitute I didn't even want"". She literally comes over and pulls the towel up which at this point was just covering my junk and spits the listerine into her hands and begins to give me a handjob. At this point I'm at a crossroads, like I can either just let this happen or tell her to stop, but she doesn't seem to understand or care what I'm saying and I gently move to get up and she shushes me and like gently pushes me back down and starts making ridiculous, porn-level fake moaning noises. I come up with my brilliant escape plan. From her first touching my junk to now, only like 15 seconds had elapsed but in my mind it felt like a lot more had. I fake an orgasm which she entirely doesn't buy and I hardly even try to sell. She looks at me quizically and says ""OK...?"" and I say ""Ok ok ok yes"" and finally am able to shoo her out. I wipe myself down with the towels to get the Listerine off me, rush to get dressed and walk out of there. 

TL;DR: My parents give me money to go and get an accidental and entirely unwanted handjob in Chinatown",tifu
"LPT: Instead of excessively worrying over a decision, decide what you're going to do, then do things to *make* it the right decision afterward.","The best class I took in my Masters program was a decision science course. The prof had a lot of great LPT-type advice, but one thing he said in particular has stuck with me. He said most people will excessively worry and over-analyze a decision, but then do very little about it after the decision is made. We spend 95% of our energy pre-decision, then 5% after. However, he said a lot of the science shows that very often there isn't a ""right"" decision, but there are things we can do after that will make it right. For example, don't feel like there's a right/wrong decision to make when considering a job offer out of state. If you do decide to take it, once you're there do things to ""make it"" the right decision, like go out and make friends, work hard but keep a good work/life balance, etc. Change that 95/5 split to more like 50/50.

AITA for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?,"My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

Ever since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this.

TIFU by smashing some girls teeth as a first impression.,"Edit: Just for a bit of clarity on the situation. I offered to pay as much as I could and she kindly said no it's all good.

I should have been more specific, her two front teeth were both really badly chipped to the point that you could barely see the base of the teeth there.

She's upset about the whole thing but has a very positive outlook on it, I've offered to help cover payments but she has politely declined.



This just happened a couple hours ago. Just a bit of context to start out. 

I'm moving into a flat with some great people in a couple of months and they invited me around for a few drinks as it was one of their birthdays. It was a bunch of about 20 of us and it was kind of a who knows who type situation.

It was a great time, everyone was getting along well, quite a few drinks, dancing, the usual stuff. Met this girl called Jess (not real name) and we got talking and she had the most amazing teeth and smile I've probably ever seen. 

Fast forward a couple of hours and we are all heading home, I'm pretty bad with women so classic me I don't make a move and just start walking home. It's about a 20 minute walk across town so nothing too bad but not ideal.

We leave at the same time and we find out we can kind of walk halfway home and split ways there. We're stumbling along with some playful banter and she jokingly tries to trip me up, I'm drunk but not that bad so I manage not to slam the concrete.
In return I jokingly trip her up and here's the TIFU. She falls like a 20 metre tall tree straight as a pole and slams the concrete. I feel so bad and instantly picked her up, she has a bloody nose and I'm freaking out because I've just slammed this Gorgeous girl into the ground.

She gets up, asks is her face okay and as she says it, I see her two front teeth are BOTH missing. My heart sank. I felt terrible. Never felt so bad in my life. I let her know the situation and she bursts out crying. 

I call an ambulance and we got to A&E where we sit for 4 hours waiting to be seen to be eventually told go home and go to the dentist tomorrow. In the 4 hours we did get to know each other relatively well considering the situation. I had a mixture of feeling terrible but also how the fuck does this happen. You only ever hear of these stories

I pay for the taxis home as it's the least I can do and take her in and she invited me in for a tea with her face still fucked up. We chat for a couple hours about random stuff and as I leave I say it'd be cool to hang out sometime and she actually agrees to it once but once her face is in better shape 

TLDR: Went to drinks, tripped up attractive Lady. Went to A&E got to know each other really well. Now who knows what'll happen",tifu
Wife asking me to get circumcised - advice?,"Hi guys!

Final update : I divorced my husband because of my MIL and now he wants back in.,"So I thought of giving you the last update as you helped me trough this.

I didn't have enough evidence to request an ex parte, aka emergency child custody. So my lawyer and I had to work on steps to prevent child abduction. We got a custody decree that included provisions including passports, travel restrictions etc.

We also had to be very wary of the signs. He in fact quit his job and on a realtors page I saw that he was putting on sale his mother's house. That and my daughters words was all we needed to notify law enforcement for them to keep an eye out.

I couldn't prevent my daughter from seeing her father. We tried to continue business as usual without my daughter feeling something was up. 

 I got a call from the police department regarding the passport situation. My daughter's passport had expired very recently (5 years validity). My ex husband had tried to recuest a passport for my daughter without my knowledge. Which was stupid because even without the decree I had to be present or submit  a notarized document of me stating that he could request the passport.

After that things went actually very fast. He was investigated because he violated the decree and it was found out that MIL had bought 3 tickets with no return date to Mexico. I could request an ex parte. After a shit ton of documents I submitted it. In most cases the judge will evaluate behind closed doors. We had the hearing yesterday (it takes usually 10 to 20 days) wich was very good for me. Atm I have sole custody for my daughter. This is all temporary. My ex has visitation rights if I was present but he can't take her anywhere. This is once the investigation of him is closed. 

I was cursed out by my ex and ex MIL and they said they will try to Contest this but they have no leg to stand on.

My daughter will continue in therapy. Specially after this. I will not prohibit him from seeing her but he needs help.

This was really scary and a very intense 2 weeks. I don't think that I will update again but I wanted to thank you all for your Tipps and support. I am really thankful as I am finally not anxious the whole time! Thank you really much!",relationship_advice
TIFU by not removing my girlfriends phone from my bed.,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, but actually close to a year ago. Last October to be exact. 

So backstory. I had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. Her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. They just didn't want one thing: us having sex before marriage. They had a lot of reasons. And we were actually planning on it. But we both weren't virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. So of course, temptation got the better of us. Okay, end of backstory. 

She was a senior in high school and I had just started college about an hour away. We rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. We would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. Everytime she would leave I would get sad, but knew I'd see her again. 

One time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. No answer. She said she was gonna text her. Made sense to me. Once she said we had, we got right to business. She put her phone on the bed, and I didn't even 

Things went on for awhile. Lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. Lots of fun. And by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. Followed by some vibrating. It was her phone ringing, but we couldn't find it. Then we found it under my ass. We laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. It was her mom. And within seconds, my girlfriend's expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. 

Turns out that she hadn't clicked send on the text she sent out. So her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. And in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone ""daddy"" who was definitely not her dad (the mother's words, not mine).  

She told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. 
My girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. I attempted to calm her down but she wouldn't. So I drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. Her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying ""how could she do this"" and other things along those lines. My girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. Her mother absolutely said I was not allowed over. 

So we got back to our hometown, I parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn't get caught. She drove home. I called my mom for a surprise ""I'm home for the weekend"". She came and picked me up, and I bawled in her arms. I told her everything. She comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. 

We got back to my house, and I laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. I cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. For the longest time, I thought I never would hear from her again. Then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. She said she was coming over and we needed to talk. Once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. She said her parents were calm now, and then I was gonna be able to come talk. I was nervous, but I loved her so I did it. 

When I got to their house, I walked in and instantly just started apologizing. I went on and on about how ""we won't do it again"" and how ""we're just stupid teenagers"" and most importantly how I was gonna ""rebuild their trust"". Eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. We opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.

At the end of it all, I learned they just loved their daughter and didn't want her getting hurt. But they trusted me. And we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. And everything is cool. Sometimes I worry it's still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support. 

TLDR: My girlfriend and I took phone sex to a whole other level.

Paying a lot for a wedding is idiotic and wedding culture in general is stupid.,"Most of the time relatively young people literally pay thousands of dollars for a single day to be surrounded by people they haven't seen for years and probably won't see for years to come the type of money that is usually spent on a wedding can go a long way for helping with a retirement plan or a really great honeymoon since most people pay more for their wedding that their honeymoon. It honestly baffles me that large expensive weddings are as popular as they are you're basically taking money that can help you in times of need or put your kid through college or any other thing.

If teenagers are not allowed to have a vasectomy they should not be allowed to go on hormone therapy before age 18,"Doctors can be incredibly patronizing towards young men and women, even those already in their twenties, when they decide to have have a vasectomy or have their tubes tied at an early age. Especially when these people do not have a family already. /r/Childfree is full of people who have a hard time getting sterilized despite being very clear about these desires.

However a sixteen year old can go on hormone treatment which also causes sterility and it's legally allowed and considered medically and ethnically correct. How is this not a double standard? One might argue that children cannot oversee the effects of their choices at a young age.

How many people haven't been young and wanted vastly different things in life from what they wanted later on? It's incredibly irresponsible to allow children to make irreversible choices for their future at an age where very few children are aware of the effects. For certain life changing decisions  you should be at least 18.",unpopularopinion

I've logged into this throwaway a couple of times over the past week and honest to go have fifty DMs and comments asking me to update so here goes. 

Some of you may also know that my story got featured on major, major news websites and blogs. It was crazy. I left way too much identifiable info in my post so pretty much all my social circle knew it was me and it was also the way most everyone figured out ex had been cheating. We had a ""meeting"" among the four of us as to whether or not we proceed. We pretty much agreed that not showing up would cause more drama and ""whispers"" than if we didn't show up so we agreed to be civil and stay in our respective places. But having to spend that hour or so in same room with him just fueled me up with adrenaline and pure rage. 

That led into  bachelorette party that night where I got freaking hammered and honest to god made out with so many guys while dancing I can't even count. I also ended up having my first one night stand ever with a 20 year old super cute guy from our university's wrestling team who was so sweet. I'm not proud of doing that but I'm also not ashamed either because it made me feel desirable and almost like I was going into the wedding day and rehearsal with some ""parity"" since, he I can be ""naughty"" too.

Ex and I were of course paired up at rehearsal and I hate to admit this, we had an absolute blast with each other. It wasn't a mistake that we had such a great and fun relationship, we are very compatible. It probably also worked because we were able to put ""the issue"" on the side and focus on something else. 


Wedding was very much the same way. We walked arm in arm down the aisle with big beaming (and genuine) smiles since we were there for our friends. I had prepared a really nasty MOH toast that would have praised my friend and her loving relationship, loyalty and truthfulness (I even included a line about you never know who is going to call in the middle of the night) but as the reception wore on I could tell the weight of the situation was really getting to my ex and I felt like I really didn't need to twist the knife any further so I gave a nice but very generic toast. 

As night went on ex was more and more out of it and sitting by himself either on his phone or with his head in his hand. I didn't want people talking about him so I asked him to dance with me which was actually really, really nice since we both didn't say anything. At the end of it he but his hands around my face like he was going to kiss me (I would have totally let him, in that moment) and just whispered how sorry he was and walked away. I got distracted and turned around he had apparently left the reception. I hate myself for it but I was so sad to see him go. This wedding is literally the last thing we ever have to do with each other. There's no expectation of GOT Sundays or Bloody Mary brunches with his mom, we wont argue over how bad IPA beer smells or who forgot to put gas in the car. Like the reality of him just being able to leave without me arguing that I'm not ready to go yet (classic introvert/extrovert pairing here) sunk in that this is over. Like over...over. I went and cried uncontrollably  in the kitchen of the hotel until the bride found me and cried with for a good half an hour. With that I knew I made the right choice in being there for my friend. 

So that is that, wedding is over and done with. No real drama, lots and lots of hurt feelings and a huge broken heart that I'm not sure how it will ever heal. I wish I could just turn off loving him but it's not going to happen.

What can I do about my WEIRDO landlord?,"Hi! Not planning to take legal action here yet but I lurk on this Reddit sometimes and I am definitely curious about something! Location: USA, Pennsylvania

I just moved into a great new apartment last month. It's a house where the downstairs is my own apartment and the upstairs is the landlord's apartment. One important thing to know is that my kitchen is detached from my other rooms. I have to go through a common hallway to reach my kitchen, but it is MY kitchen. Only problem with the place  is that the landlord has been doing some weird stuff that makes me uncomfortable. 

I was going to try to skip over the socially weird stuff that he does and keep it to the stuff that I think could be illegal. But he's very creepy. He comes down and knocks on my door often, just to be like ""What are you doing today?"" This has happened once or twice a week the past few weeks. Once he even called me. He was like ""I'm going to a party with some other property owners in the neighborhood, wanted to know if you would like to come too..."" which isn't that bad, but when I said no he started pressing me. He got kind of mad, started being like ""you know this is really disappointing to me, I thought maybe you'd want to support your new neighborhood etc"" I ended up hanging up on him. I don't want to be friends with my landlord. I hate the dynamic and he's also probably the same age as my grandparents. 

My apartment has three doors basically. But two of them are nailed shut and can't be used. It's an old house that was converted to be apartments. Last week he came down and knocked on the main door. I didn't want to talk so I didn't answer. So then...he goes down and knocks on the second and third doors really hard, knowing those can't be used. I stayed quiet and just didn't answer. Five minutes later I get an email. ""Just knocked on your door to see what you're up to. Thought I heard you down there but I guess not."" Which once again, probably not illegal but really weird and really makes me not like him. He also tries to get me to help him with things in his apartment. Like moving things around etc. I won't do it. Not that I'm opposed to helping someone but he just makes me so uncomfortable that I don't feel good going up to his place. He asks several times a week if I can help him with a ""favor"" or ""chore"" upstairs. Haven't said yes yet. 

So that gives an idea of what he's like. He is really bad at personal space. And so far it's rubbing me the wrong way. But last week he really did something that I feel is illegal. I was having some friends over for dinner in my kitchen. While we were eating he came down and just barged into my kitchen. He stood really close to one of my friends and was like ""I heard you having a party down here and wanted to introduce myself to your friends. I don't think I've met them before."" And then he did so. All of us were pretty freaked out. We were all sitting at the table and he was standing over us, right over the table, rocking back and forth. Just kind of making small talk. Trying to get to know my friends. He has come to my kitchen doorway before to say hello while he's walking through the hallway but has never come into my kitchen. I eventually got him to leave by just saying ""Alright, bye""repeatedly and then I stood up and showed him to the door. My friends left immediately afterwards. One of them was kind of upset and just freaked out about the way he was being. I didn't know what to do. I was so mad. The next day I sent him an email, so that it could be documented in writing. I said basically, what you did last night is not okay. You are never allowed in my apartment without permission. I pay you rent for my place, you respect my privacy, Etc. Made it clear that it pissed me off and I wasn't okay with it. He tried to make me feel bad in his response and didn't really apologize. He was like ""well I heard there was company in my house and I wanted to introduce myself. I was just trying to be nice and social"" or something like that. Tried to make it seem like he's this innocent lonely old man. Doesn't seem to think that what he did was wrong! I don't buy it. Keep in mind that he's been a landlord for a long time and has had many tenants and has to know how this stuff works. He's a creep. 

So what I'm wondering is...if he does something like this again is there legal action I can take? Do landlords have to give a notice before coming into your apartment? I thought that was a thing. The reason I'm worried/wondering is because I haven't lived here but a few weeks and he's already pushed these personal boundaries very aggressively. If he continues down this path of invading my privacy, there's got to be something I can do, right?",legaladvice
I (23F) genuinely think that there's someone living in my attic.,"I'm not sure this is the right place to post but it made the most sense to me. I have reasonable suspicion that someone is squatting in my attic or accessing it on a regular basis. 

To note. The house hadn't been lived in for about 4 months prior. And is in an OKAY area of Cleveland, OH. 

I've been moved in for about a month and a half - I've heard whats sounded like footsteps at first more than a handful of times but then I've just chucked it up to being new house sounds. I'll be honest and say I've been too scared to see if anything's up there since I've moved in so I've never even seen the attic. Today my sister and her boyfriend were staying over for the holidays so I asked him to check it out. He popped up with a flashlight and there's a tent set up. He came down and told me. My sister and I came outside and he locked the back door and came out the front. The back door is directly in front of where the attic opens. We called the cops and waited about ten minutes. Once the cops arrived the back door was unlocked and no one was in the tent. Cops didn't do anything and didn't even go up to check. They were neato. So I put my head up to check while they were there. It's a tent. There's playing cards. They took my name and left. 

Sooo I nailed the attic shut and blocked all entries to my home. I was thinking first thing I should do is get new locks and window monitors in the morning. 

Other than that - Do I hire someone to check the house? Do I call the cops again another day?  
Should I not stay here alone?

UPDATE: My other sisters boyfriend came over today and the two of them went up there and scooped it out. It looks like a weird grow op. Can't can't if anyone was there. To me it doesn't look like it. But it's strange regardless

UPDATE2: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

TLDR: My GF was raped. Wanted to abort. Talked to mother. Decided not to abort. I left her. 

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

TLDR: GF calls me, reveals Mum made her not get an abortion because GOD CARES. She wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. Some of Reddit think I'm a baby killer.


I was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but I thought I should provide an update on some recent events from a Mother from the pits of Satan's rectum.

On Saturday, I answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. They asked me if I was who I was, and I replied I was. They then said they were looking for my GF. I called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.

The officers then split, one taking the GF to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.

The officer who took me started asking me questions about how long GF had been here. If she had any contact with anyone else. If she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. I answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on GF. I asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn't say. 

After a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. The moment they left, my GF told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if I had been hurting her. She was also asked if she was being held against her will. She said no to everything, of course. She said that the police received a call from her Mother saying she might be in danger, and that I could be abusive her.

I was fucking livid. I immediately said I was going to press charges against her - for what? I dunno. Harrassment probably?

My GF begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to ""calm down"".

Wtf? She sent police to my house to get me arrested. How is that sane thinking? I could lose my job if I was arrested and charged. What the hell is she thinking?

I told GF that if the Mother does anything like this again, I will definitely press charges. So the GF decides on Sunday to talk to the Mum to not do anything like this again.

They had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then I start hearing sobs. Immediately, I walked into the room, saw my GF was crying, still holding the phone against her ear. 

I plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as I heard ""hello?"" From the phone. Then I put it on me, and said ""you're a disgrace of a Mother"" and hung up.

Then I held the GF for what felt like an hour before we started talking.

Apparently, the Mother was telling GF how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the Mother again, or her brother, or her deceased Father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat GF, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because GF would be going to damnation.

I told GF that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we'd be nice and toasty together. I love her smile.

What do you think, if anything, should I do about the Mother? No doubt my words to her will have some reactions.


Response to some people from previous threads and PMs after thread was locked:

1 - Abortion was never an option. GF was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her Mother. And if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.

2 - You can believe my GF cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, I suppose.  Just FYI, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck. Cheating...right........

I cut a tree down on my own property to save my house. My neighbor says he is suing,"I can't find any legal precedent for this.

My neighbor - a litigator and attorney demands compensation for his trees. He then commissioned a survey that identified other stakes and the rest of the boundaries. The trees were actually further into my property. He accosted my wife at the mailbox saying we had no right to take his trees and they are on his property. He now wants me to pay for his survey, a new fence and ""his trees"".  Should I be overly concerned about how this would play out in court. All 3 trees were leaning over my house in excess of 60-100 ft. All were dead with one in an advanced state of decay. When the tree company removed them I specifically had them left on my property in view in the event that something like this happened because my neighbor is a known to be against tree removal and cutting. So to reiterate. Trees are well within my property confirmed by ""common sense"" and an actual survey paid for by my neighbor in an attempt to claim ownership of them. Trees are dead and dangerous - considered a hazard by my insurance company . I paid a significant amount of money to remove them. My neighbor says he is going to file a lawsuit over it.",legaladvice

"AITA for ""mocking"" my coworker after her boyfriend of three years cheated on her?","I am currently in college, working for the summer at a small company in South Carolina. However, I am originally from New York.

My first day at work, I met the two women who I would be sharing an office with. One woman, Madison is only 2 years older than me.

When I first met them both, they seemed very friendly, and asked a bunch of questions. I told them I was from New York and Madison said ""oh we're not going to get along. I hate people from the North."" I thought she was joking so I sort of laughed it off. 

Well, it turns out she wasn't kidding. Over the last two months or so that I've worked there, Madison has complained about ""yankees"" a lot. Her most common complaints are:
- northerners are too ""sensitive"" (politics)
- northerners don't respect God enough
- northerners have no ""southern hospitality""
- northerners don't have family values
- northerners have no morals

(She has made all these assumptions from one trip she took to NYC in 6th grade because a homeless man called her mother a bitch for ignoring his request for money.) 

Madison is particularly critical of my boyfriend (who she has never even met before). Ever since finding out he was both from New Jersey and black, she has made many insensitive and rude assumptions about him.

She has accused my boyfriend of being abusive, rude, ugly, ""ghetto"", selfish, and many other negative things without ever actually meeting him. And, she always goes on and on about how her ""country boy"" is God's gift to earth. She constantly tells me that I need to find a religious southern man like she has. 

So, all in all, Madison is the worst and I try to keep my distance from her by any means possible. 

Today, I was in meetings all morning. When I came back, Madison was crying and the other lady was comforting her. As soon as I walked in Madison told me through heavy sobbing that a girl had instagram DMed her to tell her that her boyfriend had been cheating withher for the past YEAR. The girl only told her because he had just recently ""cheated"" on her with ANOTHER GIRL and she found out. 

After Madison told me all this I said ""hm.. looks like dating a ""country boy"" doesn't work out for everyone"" and then I went to my lunch break. 

I honestly didn't really feel bad about it cause I didn't think what I said was that rude,but the other lady from our office said that I was out of line with that comment. She doesn't like Madison either, but she thinks I took it too far. So, now I'm torn.

"Why are there so many popular right-wing ""dominant debaters"" (Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiunnapalosi), but left-wing counterparts seem nowhere to be found?","Tl;Dr: The personality of an ""always right"", dominant debater, is common amongst several right-wing public figures, but I have trouble understanding why the same personality seems so scarce within left politics.

The whole ""arguing with facts"" , being extremely confident and forward, is my best way of describing the personality of the two mentioned in the title (amongst others, that Steven Crowder guy from the meme).

I'm not taking a political stance here, but generally these debaters have compilations on youtube on how they ""destroy a liberal"" or ""dismantle socialism in front of a communist crowd"", and the whole idea of someone speaking that is regarded as never being wrong, usually puts me off.

But I never see a similar personality type of a left-wing debater. Hell I can't recall seeing a prominent left wing figure that does public speeches and debates where they ""dismantle the capitalist agenda"".

AITA For being angry at my sister for not attending our fathers funeral because of his criminal history.,"My father died right before new years. He passed away from natural causes while incarcerated and serving a life sentence. His next parole hearing was in less than a year but he suffered from lung cancer (smoker) and he also had a hip injury last october which at 70 can lead to complications.

My father was a provider to a family of three kids, my mother never had to work. He paid for my sisters wedding. He paid for my brothers braces and dental work all out of pocket. At home I would say that he was kind to us 70% of the time.

However, my father was also a semi famous in our local area (in the late 80's and early 90's) as a murderer. He has now paid his due to society.

My sister (the one who got her wedding paid for) refused to attend his funeral, even though both me and my elderly mother asked. She says that our father was just a monster and that she doesnt want to participate in it. 

I feel very angry about this. I realize she is an adult but I also feel like she is being childish and over dramatic and extremely hurtful to not just me but my elderly mother who has lost the will to live.

We meet up for coffee and hit it off, then decide to head back to my place so I can try and woo her with my mediocre cooking skills. We end up making an awesome stir fry together and things are going great. I excuse myself after the meal to change because I ended up with a stained shirt trying to show off my nonexistent culinary prowess.

I put away all of the stuff relating to my ex except for one thing. We were engaged, it was to be a gift for our last dating anniversary before the wedding. A miniature dock light from a book, a symbol between 2 literature nerds from the very beginning of our relationship. So here my date is, being incredibly sweet and asking about my knick knacks. I didn't really want to get into it, so I told her a partial truth that it was from this book I really liked, leaving out the collosal significance it once held. 

The next thing I know she's queuing up the movie the book was made into on my TV and inviting me to come ""chill"" with her on the couch. So here I am with this poor woman half way through a movie, my head swirling with memories of my ex that I am absolutely still in love with and I start crying. This isn't a sneaky tear either so she obviously notices and askes what was wrong... By this point I know I'm fucked, and I do my best to choke stuff back and stammer out an apology saying ""I lost touch with a good friend, and this was our favourite movie and I miss them more than I thought"". So now the mood has completely changed, and after some awkward small talk she suggested we reschedule and took off. Now I'm sitting here sipping whisky directly from the bottle, trying to decide if I should hit up tinder or therapy...

At the pre-game, my ex had a couple shots, was maybe tipsy. She came up to me and my girlfriend and started talking to us normally. I was kind of confused as to why, but just went with it. She then says to my girlfriend, ""Hey did you know me and Ilovepotatoes22 used to date back in the day?"" to which she says, ""Yes, I'm aware"". Ex gf smirks very subtly and under her breath says, ""Yup and he sure downgraded"" while looking me dead in the eye. My gf said ""Wow, I'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me"" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. I was angry, I truly don't believe I ""downgraded"" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes I do find her more attractive than my ex. I told my ex ""I'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. Let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again"". 

She went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them I called her uglier than my current gf. I told my friends what actually happened and they understand but they told me I could have been a little bit less harsh. Ex gf is apparently really depressed and has been telling my friends that she doesn't want to come to any of the hang outs anymore. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole

Update. Stabbed at work and fired for my troubles.,"So before I give the Update, I wanted to say a few things. 

First I am not some Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, Taekwondo, Krav Maga, or Patrick Swayze Roadhouse style bar bouncer. I am not a veteran who obtained my sick martial arts skills in the streets of Mosul. What happened was simply addrenaline and a decent amount of martial arts training I received when I was a kid kicking in. Although I do occasionally work out at the gym at my work so I am stronger than your average network admin. Also for those calling bullshit in the PMs saying that a punch to the jaw will not knock you out, well I have a small lesson. A well placed punch to the jaw can cause minor to major brain trauma as the act of your brain shaking about in your head can overload the nervous system making you lose consciousness. Your muscles instantly relax and you fall to the ground with no memory of the last few seconds. 

In other words go watch some UFC... 

Second. To the people in the thread and in my PMs, I did not punch him in retaliation for stabbing me. His knife was still inside me and his hand was on the knife when I punched him in pure fear. More like 100 percent pure terror. 

So on to the update. The company I worked for is a wholly owned subsidiary. This will be important later. The CEO of my company was unwilling to hear my side of it no matter how many times I tried to approach him.  The best response I got was when his secretary gave me the line of ""trusting the decisions of HR."" Several emails and 2 phone calls got the same response from him and his assistant each and every time. Because of the fact that no one at the office is willing to even hear my side, I decided to go to a lawyer that was recommended through a friend. Friend contacted a lawyer he used in the past who referred me to someone he trusts. Upon hearing my story the lawyer was very eager to take my case on contingency.  As an added bonus, he decided to represent the other three guys who helped out that day as well. 

The lawyer decided to name the parent company in the suit along side our former employer. His reasoning is that the parent company would have reviewed all corporate policies that the subsidiary has and that they would have had final say on the policies and procedure. This would have inevitably included the zero tolerance workplace violence clause that caused us to be terminated. 

Well the parent company, a company with many public contracts for city and state police in the area I might add, was not too happy to hear about what had happened. The event was apparently downplayed when it was reported to the parent company. They told the parent company something along the lines of ""A scuffle broke out in the office. As a result one of the employees was seriously injured. All employees involed will be terminated and Law enforcement are handling the criminal aspect."" Paraphrasing but that was the jist of it. 

Upon hearing about the truth of the matter, they were VERY quick to set up a meeting with us. This is a company that is in the self defense and security business. Not to be confused with people in the firearm business. They do not sell firearms, but do provide armor, non lethal options, and have security subsidiaries for police, security firms, and private citizens.  

Given the nature of their business, they know full well the damage that negative press could do if word got out that one of their subsidiaries fired a guy who fought for his life. This was the PR nightmare that gave us the edge in the negotiations.  The subsidiary I worked for is not in the self defense business. They are a security monitoring firm that only handles corporate contracts so they were not worried about that kind of press like the parent company was. Upon hearing the full details of what went down that day, the parent company went into panic mode. 

The three guys who held down my attacker wont be getting their old jobs back, but they were offered jobs doing the same thing at parent company's facility 12 miles away. They will also be compensated for lost wages at time and a half their normal pay rate for the time they were out of work. Parent company pretty much directed our old company to comply with this offer and our old company cut them a check. Since parent company has better benefits and better pay, this was a slam dunk victory for those three. Cherry on top for them is this means a closer drive for all of them. This offer was contingent on the three guys not going after either company for monetary compensation outside of what was offered, and the signing of a non disclosure agreement. With the NDA and a signed contract guaranteeing employment for at least a year, barring obvious reason to fire people, it would have been stupid of them not to take it.  

For me it was a little more complicated. They are very willing to offer me the same thing, but there are complications from infections that occurred from the stabbing as I developed MRSA in the wound. Fortunately it remains localized in my wound and has not spread to my blood stream, however if it progresses any worse than it currently is, my doctor thinks it may be prudent to cut out the infection. It is being watched very carefully and I spend probably 2 days out of the week in the hospital having the wound drained. In the meantime I have been offered the job, plus the ability to be paid while I work from home. This would allow me to get on their excellent coverage plan. (they only have a 1k deductible for single person) 

My lawyer basically told me that this was the best possible deal I could get without going to trial. He explained that the parent company can take the hit on the publicity and survive, but that since all they have to do is offer me a job and get the old company to pay me for the time I was out of work, why not? Minor expense to them and they do not have to worry about bad publicity. I took the deal they offered and signed a non disclosure agreement. 

So TL:DR of that one is that the each of us were offered compensation for lost wages and offered better paying jobs at the parent company. Far as I know our former job is paying the lawyer fees. We did not pay a dime for his services. 

As for the guy who stabbed me? I was very pissed off to learn he was offered a plea deal. His charges were reduced from attempted murder to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Since he was a model citizen before his knife wielding episode, and since this was a crime of passion, he was offered a mere 1 year in prison and a year of probation plus a 10k fine. I am told that there is the possibility that he can have his record expunged and that he can be out in as little as six months. I know that he has not appeared before the judge yet to take this plea deal. They were waiting to see if I would die as the charge would obviously change from agg assault to murder 2. Once they found out that I was stable and that the MRSA was not life threatening, they set a court date for the 12th. I will be there. 

Because of the fact that a lawsuit against him right now would be a lawsuit against his wife and child, I decided not to do anything on that front. Going after him would be a cash grab and would only hurt two people who had nothing to do with what happened that day. So I see no reason to sue him. 

Also before it is asked, yes I am taking extreme measures to deal with my MRSA. I have paid a company to come in and clean my house 4 times so far, I am taking my medications on time every time, and I am following doctor instructions for cleaning and replacing bandages. It is getting better, but my doctor thinks I will be dealing with this all the way until after valentine's day. ",legaladvice
AITA for refusing to return the jeans I stole from the girl who I caught in bed with my boyfriend (ex)?,"brand new account and throwaway for you guys. 

So Tuesday of last week I made my now ex-boyfriend dinner. He's a paleo junkie and I really wanted to impress him so I skipped class to slice fennel with a razor blade in order to garnish the strip steak I made for him. Yeah I really, really (really) loved him. I decided it would be easier to cook the steak in his kitchen so I went over to his place early (I have a code and open invite). I walked in to find half eaten Dominoes pizza on the counter (remember I sliced fennel with a razor blade because he's so ""dedicated"" to paleo) and noises coming from the bedroom. 

I walked in and he was absolutely plowing a good looking girl with a spectacular body. Fuck me for not eating pizza to impress him. I stood there in shock. She saw me over his shoulder first and started tapping furiously for him to get off. He turned around and hit me with the oh so classic ""this isn't what it looks like!"" 

I was speechless and had no idea what to do but I saw her clothes hanging over his desk chair. Because apparently I'm a petty b!tch, the only thing I could think was I wanted her to have leave his apartment without pants. I don't know, it made sense at the time. 

He came after me begging me not to overreact, I didn't say a word and took off to my car. In the days since he's gone from begging me to ""be reasonable,"" to begging me not to break up with him and promising he'll never do it again.

The thing is, I love these jeans. Yes as a trophy of me being petty and at least ruining something of hers like she had he tag teamed to ruin my heart and self esteem. But they are also a super expensive brand, they look really good on me and I like wearing them. 

So EX has gone from begging me to get back together with him to saying that me keeping the jeans is causing him ""real problems."" I don't give a slight shit about his problems but I sort of feel bad about keeping this girl's clothes. 

So I'm asking...I know I'm petty...but am I an asshole?

Edit: the plot thickens, I just woke up to following text:

""hi, Alyssa. This is the weirdest text I've ever written. I'm Madison and I was the girl in Aiden's room last week. I'm so, so, so sorry, I don't know how to say it other than that. The look on your face will haunt me for the rest of my life. Please believe me when I say I didn't know he had a girlfriend. I would have never been there had I known. You have every reason not to care, but this last year has been so hard for me, my dad died of pancreatic cancer in December and I'm struggling so hard and find myself making bad choice after bad choice which I how came to be in Aiden's room. The pants you have are the ones I bought the day before my dad died, he gave me ""permission"" to go treat myself and it's the last time I ever heard him call me by his pet name as in ""pumpkin, please don't be afraid to get you want, buy your jeans."" It would mean the world to me if you returned them to me. I know you've been hurt and I feel for you and I think Aiden is pure scum, all I want from him is getting my pants back. Please find it in your heart to return them to him or contact me directly. Thank you so much, Madison.""

So I guess I have to give them back...I'm in tears here.

Edit 2: just woke Aiden up at 5:45 (on Org Chem test day too...fuck him) with ""what's Madison's last name?"" He tried to give me the ""who's Madison?"" at first but then told him she texted me. He tried to talk me out of it but then relented so he could go back to sleep. So I looked her up on Facebook and it's pretty bare but she does have a ""instamodel"" sister who has all sorts of sad posts with like her holding her dads hand while has IV and then a somewhat touching insta memorial to her dad...so I'm thinking the text is not a lie.

Edit3: I just texted back and forth with her, we're meeting at Starbucks at 9.


Edit4: (Wednesday evening—had tried to do a new post but mods suggested I just edit the op...so this is a cut and paste. Hope it makes sense I'm just starting on my second bottle of skinny girl so hope this makes sense) So wow, that first post got a ton of heat and I'm so thankful, really for the chance to get some input but also because a lot of you are very, very funny and I appreciated the laughs. I don't know what the overall verdict was but I'm ok to think I was being an asshole in keeping the jeans.

So like many of you saw, the girl (Madison) texted me overnight telling me about why the jeans were important to her and asking if I would give them back. We texted back and forth a few times this morning and agreed we'd meet at the Starbucks by campus so I could return them. I got there and instantly recognized her and she got up and gave me a hug which I thought was very sweet (I'm a hugger too) and she had bought me like three different varieties of venti drinks to make sure she got one I liked (or as she admitted later, she was so nervous she didn't know what to do) which I also thought was very cool. I wasn't sure whether or not I even really wanted to talk with her but the coffee was enough entre to get me to sit down. I handed her the jeans and she was very thankful and again explained the story about her dad and teared up. Lots of people told me not to believe her but if she's lying, she's a sociopath because I could tell she was really upset by it. I did my best to comfort her which I hope was well received.

So as we got past that the only things I wanted to know were: how long had she known Aiden, did she know about me being his girlfriend and was she hoping to continue seeing him. She said they met when he and some friends went to her restaurant maybe a month ago and had been texting back and forth ever since, she said last Tuesday was the first time they'd met in person and she said she swore to god she didn't know he had a girlfriend. She said after I showed up Tuesday she was so disgusted she got dressed in her spare clothes (fat lot of good it did me to steal her jeans if my plan was to embarrass her) and left and didn't even process that her special jeans were gone until about a day later when she stared bugging him to get them back but she had no interest in seeing him. She said she was so frustrated with him stonewalling her had stopped by to get my number directly but he wouldn't even do that so she got it from his neighbor who happened to hear them arguing...she'd had my number since Sunday but was too nervous to text until yesterday.

Lots more happened and I can expand more in the comments but I think i'm running out of room...anyways so our plan is she is not going to tell him that I gave her the jeans back and start to demand he pay for them or buy her a new pair. When he does, she'll just give me the money or the jeans and then we'll give him the old...""thanks for the jeans but us adults already worked it out...toodles."" Yes we are deceiving him but we both agree he deserves it.
Like I said lots more details but running into the 3000 character limit so I can say more if anyone is interested. Thank you for being so invested in my life. I've felt pretty rejected since this all went down and will have a hole in my heart for a long time...the kindness of internet strangers really, really helped for a few hours",AmItheAsshole

AITA for not paying for the meal?,"On a road trip last week, my girlfriend and I stopped at a rural diner for brunch. We sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). It was a very nice meal honestly. Our total was around $25. I was ready to pay with my debit card.

The waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. Unfortunately I had zero cash on me. ""How were we supposed to know?"" I asked. She shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. Because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. There was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.

She sighs and points to an ATM on the other side of the dining room. At this point I'm still apologetic so I went there with my card. I noticed it had a fee of, I shit you not, $9. I asked to speak to the manager. She brought the owner.

I told the owner this is ridiculous. I suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that ATM. Nope. He threatened to call the police. I said go ahead. My girlfriend felt the same way. Long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.

I told my sister about this today. She thinks the cops were wrong and I was being an asshole. Because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" I think the owner is the asshole. The only part I regret was not being able to tip the waitress.

"Modern feminism, ""boss babe"" and ""girl power"" culture is really patronizing, degrading, and it is counterintuitive to the main message that equality is supposed to represent.","I am a mid-20s female, and this mentality just drives me insane. I get where people are coming from, but it just sounds so infantilizing to have an entire ""movement"" based around this idea that women need reassurance that they're capable, powerful, and smart too. 

For example, I am a small business owner, and I find it frustrating when other businesses go out of their way to say they're ""woman-owned"". It's like, okay...great...good for you, I guess? Should I applaud you or something? It's not a woman-owned business. It's just a fucking business, get over yourself.

The thing is, I'm not oblivious to the struggles women have had in the past, and still have to some degree today. But at some point, equality is equality and it's entirely counterintuitive to your cause if you're making up all these special treatments for women. 

I want help and support because I asked, because I need it, because I deserve it (if, in whatever situation, I do deserve it. Sometimes we don't.). I don't want this weird, automatic, yet backhanded support just because I'm a female. 

Another thing I hate is when other women are like, ""It's your obligation as a female to support other females!"" Uhh no. I will support you if I believe in you and what you're doing. But just because we both share a commonality, doesn't mean our values automatically align.

Don't get me wrong, I'm proud to be a woman! Or...at least as proud as normal people are about something they didn't earn or make happen themselves...like, it's fine and I'm happy with it.

AITA for still wanting to go to Hawaii after breaking up with my girlfriend?,"My girlfriend and I had been together for 2 and a half years.  Before my decision to break up we had bought a vacation package together for her sisters wedding in Maui.  She was short on splitting the cost so I covered $1,700 of the $2,500 total cost.

After the breakup she would not allow me to go with her because it was my choice to end the relationship and she would not be paying me back for any part of the trip.  I insisted that I should still be able to go because of the amount I paid towards the trip.

[Update] Overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

So I read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, I was doubting if I made the right decesion. I wasn't going to update because I didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days I came to a final conclusion.I want to clarify that I broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

After I broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. She would send me letters and call me a lot. In one of the texts I actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. Without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. I was about to agree, but something she said made me realize I would be making a mistake if I did. She said, ""I'll remember to respect from now on."" That sentence made me realize that I made the right choice by breaking up. Since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

Either way I'm glad I didn't give her a second chance. I don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

On a sidenote, the other day I was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and I guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that I moved on to fast.

"Getting a divorce, an update to a previous story. (ohio)","Here's the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5j2max/my_husband_drained_our_accounts_and_wants_to_kick/

First, I want to say that I logged out of this account that evening, and didn't come back until now, and I was BLOWN AWAY by all of the people offering food, gift certificates, or just good will, and I started crying.. again.  I will respond to each of you individually.

So, to recap: My STBX is a cheating ass, and he panicked and tried to erase his family. 

The update: This all happened on a Sunday, so there wasn't a lot I could do right then. I put the kids to bed, and called my mom and cried. Then, I called my mother in law, who was horrified.

My inlaws came over that night with $200 in cash and a check for much more. My father in law is didn't say much, but he did fix my bathroom door (which is how he shows affection), and muttered that he would ""fix this"".

I opened a new checking account at a new bank (THANKS FOR THIS ADVICE) with the check my in laws gave me.

I opened a new credit card in my name.

My mother deployed a niece to help with childcare for the next week, I called in a lot of childminding favors, and with the cash my inlaws gave me, I was able to pay the babysitter while I worked this out.

I met with two divorce attorneys- both of them told me about what you had said, that he was legally screwed. I chose one, and we set the process in motion to get an emergency hearing, but by Tuesday, my old checking account had *most* of the money back, and my husband was asking to ""talk"".

On the advice of my lawyer, I took half of the checking account money and put it in my new bank, and kept records of everything.  

I pulled our credit reports- He has over $40,000 in credit card debt. I also found out, that he received a raise last year, and funneled this money out of our shared accounts. I would have figured this out when I did our taxes, and this led to him panicking and trying to ""erase"" us. 

Keep in mind, this asshole gave me gonorrhea. I am an accountant by trade, and I'm afraid of CC debt the way some girls are afraid of spiders, so I was horrified about this, but my lawyer thinks it's likely that he'll have to have this debt on his own, as my name isn't on it, and it seems that most of it was spent on his side piece.

We have started mediation, which he agreed to when he realized that he would need to pay for BOTH of our divorce attnys.

My goal- which my lawyer thinks is reasonable, is to ask for alimony until I either re-marry (not likely) or my 2 year old is in school full time, and to have a reasonable amount of child support until she's 18, and then we'll split college costs for all of them. When all the kids are in school, I can concentrate on getting back to work.

I also plan to sell the house and buy a smaller house in a less elite section of town.  The kids can share rooms, and I can live mortgage free. 

So, I'm heartbroken, and diseased, but there's also an incredible weight that his lifted from me. Our marriage has been bad for so long, and I didn't even realize how unhappy I was, and how.. absent by husband was.  It took my 5 year old almost a week to realize that Daddy was gone.

TIFU by hiding a murderous clown in my roommate's closet,"This happened a few years ago, long before the resurgence of IT...

My mom is an artist and made me an assortment of life sized Halloween decorations. A 12 foot tall grim reaper, with scythe, a bandage wrapped mummy and... a 6 foot tall, stocky, murderous clown. This creature was the source of nightmares. It had crazy clown hair, dead eyes and held a decapitated head in one hand. 

Both my roommate and I hated this clown. I had nightmares about it crawling up the stairs to murder me in my sleep. So it was normally stored, in a corner of the basement, facing the wall. 

One night, I was feeling particularly pranksterish, so I hauled the clown out of the basement, and positioned it in my roommate's closet. The closet had sliding doors, so when you opened the door, the clown would fall out. 

I took some fishing line, tied a bell to the end, placed it in the closet, and wrapped the rest out of her room, down the hallway and into my room. And waited.

She comes home, goes to bed... 

And I wait.

Around 2 am, I start pulling on the fishing line, making the bell jingle. 

She got up, expecting one of my cats to have trapped themselves in her closet, flings open the door... 

And the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard filled the house.

She moved out shortly after. 

Edit: holy shit this post blew up. No, I'm not a corporate shill, but if you know where you get hired for such things, let me know. Also, it would appear everyone assumed I was a guy... I'm a chick. We have evil streaks too.

Can I file for a restraining order for an ex-girlfriend that hasn't left me alone for almost five years (since we broke up),"Hey!
Just a bit of backstory, I dumped this girl in ninth grade after she committed credit card theft (Just her parents' card, but spent almost $1000). Obviously if she'd steal from her parents, she'd steal from her boyfriend. She's never let it go. No other boyfriends, and got into crazy amounts of trouble at school afterwards. In senior year, she was busted for sending nudes of herself to minors, from fellow seniors (Myself, 17 at the time, included) all the way down to seventh graders. (She was 19 at the time) School covered it up, even with copious amounts of proof. She was let off without even a suspension. Nonetheless, she's never stopped contacting me. Every two months or so, she'll try to text me with a new number or social media account or email. I block them constantly, but it's like cutting the head off of a hydra. Two more replace it. She's constantly belittled me, made fun of my mother's death, lied to girlfriends I had, saying we slept together and such, and basically done everything she can to ruin anything that makes me happy, and I'm tired of it. She emailed my college email account the other day, as we both go to the same community college, and I wrote up this reply, but before I sent it, I wanted to know if there is anything I should/ shouldn't say.

Julia,

Listen, I'm going to be completely honest with you. I don't know why you keep trying to contact me. At the risk of coming off rude, Julia, I literally want nothing to do with you. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to see you. I just don't want you to be part of my life. I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings, but we broke up in ninth grade. We're done. Permanently. Please, for the love of god, find a new hobby. I've given you chances on top of chances and every time I try and reconcile with you, you fuck me over, and I'm really tired of it. Your opinion of me is the last thing I care about, so call me whatever you want, but I'm tired of you fucking up anything that makes me happy because you get some sick form of pleasure from it. Please don't contact me, my family, or my friends again. If you do, and I'm being 100% honest here, I will file for a restraining order. You're coming dangerously close to stalker territory, and I'm done. So, politely, fuck off.

Regards,
u/homelesscheeto

So, I guess my final question, are these acceptable grounds to file a restraining order? Or does she physically need to be stalking me or whatever. Any advice would be appreciated! (Going to school for Law so I'm curious to get some expert opinion here) Thanks :)

TIFU By Getting My Tonsils Removed,"I like many people in adulthood have had to deal with the annoyance of overgrown tonsils. From the 3 – 4 times a year tonsillitis, to the sleep apnoea that they cause. Personally, I wanted my tonsils gone.

After getting tonsillitis for the second time this year I decided enough is enough, I booked an appointment with my GP, referred to the surgeon and made a date for the surgery.

I was warned that I was in for the sorest through of my life and that it was going to be agony for a while. Which was ok, how bad could it be?

Day 1: I was prepped and ready to go, surprisingly not too nervous for my first major surgery. The procedure went well, my tonsils were gone and I was all set to recover in hospital. The pain wasn't too high yet, I was still spaced out from the drugs, so all in all the first night was quite easy.

Day 2:

4AM: I woke up needing to go to the bathroom, I felt like I needed to spit so I rushed over to the bathroom sink. I spat out a few mouthfuls of blood not thinking too much of it. I slowly shuffled back to my bed and quickly fell back asleep.

7:30AM: This time I awoke to a lot of pain, I buzzed the nurse to get my dose of Endone and Panadol. I mentioned to her that I had bled a little overnight. She was immediately concerned, she passed me a plastic cup and told me to spit all the blood that comes up from now.

(I thought that leaking blood would be common as it was when I got my wisdom teeth out.)

For the next few hours slowly but surely I was filling up this cup that looked more and more like red wine. It was horrible because the pain was quite high regardless of the pain killers, I couldn't lie down an rest as the blood would go in to my stomach.

10PM: The nurses tried to use an ice pack on my neck and give me countless icy poles to freeze the blood but nothing was working, I had filled almost two cups now and they decided it was time to call my surgeon.
They broke the bad news to me and told me I needed to be prepped for surgery again. I was surprisingly ok with it. I remained calm and collected. I went through the procedure again of getting countless needles and being sedated. (FUN!)

Post second surgery: I was back where I was today but hopefully no more bleeding! The surgeon informed me that a blood vessel had haemorrhaged around my tonsil area causing blood to leak. I had to have blood sucked out of my stomach because I had indeed swallowed quite a bit of blood.

He told me that this complication only happens once a year for him! (Lucky me.)

Day 3-4:

The recovery was brutal and painful, I was in bed all day, struggling to get any solids down as the pain was too bad to swallow. However, no complications.

Day 5:
For anyone who has had the pleasure of having a tonsillectomy you would know the most painful part about it is waking up from a snooze.

I learnt that the best thing to do is get up, drink some water and have some meds ASAP!

I was getting out of the shower when I felt a large amount of liquid in my mouth, I leaned over the sink and spat out blood.

Here is a picture of the sink: https://m.imgur.com/kpxtoMf

My mum, who had been amazing throughout this whole thing, was luckily around the corner from my home when this happened. So I called her and we decided the safest bet would be returning to hospital.

I felt very unwell in the car ride, and I was pale as a ghost. They quickly put an IV in and gave me fluids.

After a VERY long wait we were advised by my surgeon to return home and come back in if it were to happen again.

I returned home and rested up for a few hours, it was around 9PM when I felt the same liquid taste in the back of my throat. This time I knew. I rushed to the bathroom and proceeded to cough up blood.

Here's a photo of this time: http://imgur.com/s2YFx39

As you can see, it's a lot more this time around.

I don't know if you have ever had the displeasure of coughing up blood but the worst part about it is just how sticky blood is. It sticks to your tongue, throat and lips, resulting in blood clots getting stuck in your mouth. It's horrible.

I called my mum and she rushed over to come get me.

Back to hospital again and another IV :)

I was admitted back to the ward and I stayed overnight, my night wasn't overly dramatic. I bled once around 3-4AM but it only lasted 5 minutes so there wasn't much for concern.

DAY 6!!!!

Things were looking ok, I was still in a lot of pain but I had not bled outside of the little one in the morning.

1PM: I was watching shitty daytime TV as I reached to have a sip of water, I felt that same feeling in my throat come on and it felt heavy quick.

I had no time to react so I grabbed the smoothie cup I had received from my mum and proceeded to spit mouthfuls of blood in to it. I was trying to get a hold of my buzzer to notify the nurse.

They came in shortly after and rushed to get me a vomit bag, it was coming FAST. The nurses were trying to keep me calm and they again put an ice pack behind my neck to try and slow down the bleeding. I kept coughing it up. I started making gagging noises as the blood was sticking and clotting around my throat.

I started to feel light headed. Within seconds of saying that, I fainted.

I woke up seconds later to the ward now being in Code Blue, I had never seen so many nurses and doctors in one room so fast. There must have been 15-20 people in this small room. I had needles going in to my arms, an oxygen mask being put on, and multiple nurses and doctors talking to me.

""Raph, stay with us.""

""Raph, look at me, keep your eyes open.""

This was the first time in my life that I was genuinely scared for my life.

I could overhear that they were trying to get a hold of my surgeon, because once again I needed emergency surgery.

I was rushed into theatre and they prepped me again. Giving me another IV there was a delay because my surgeon was finishing up surgery for another patient at another hospital.

It was at this moment where I broke down crying. I felt so sick, all I could taste was blood, I was scared, alone. I didn't know what was going to happen to me. All the while I was still coughing up a lot of blood.

After some time had passed, the nurse with me was starting to panic.

""We need to get him into theatre now!""

They kept trying to give me oxygen but I kept coughing blood into the mask.

My surgeon arrived and I was put to sleep.

I woke up in unbearable pain and agony, it was the worst pain I had felt since this whole thing began. But that quickly changed when I was given morphine.

I rested up and was eventually moved back into the ward and I was greeted by my mum and nan. My poor mother had been through hell. She had only just before it all went down. She was bawling her eyes out the whole time I was going through it all, blaming herself for leaving :(

Day 7:

I got a big sleep and I woke up to my surgeon checking in on me. He was truly sorry for my ordeal, and said I was the worst he had ever seen.

The cause was the same as last time, a vessel had opened up and caused the bleeding.

All in all I lost 800ml of blood from that ordeal. That's almost a fifth of total blood!

It's crazy to think that if I wasn't in the ward when it happened there was a good chance I could have died.

Day 8-9:

I stayed in hospital. Everyone agreed that it was the best place for me, just in case thunder struck three times.

I was pretty shook on Day 8 still, but as soon as word got out that it went from standard procedure to almost fatal I was receiving a lot of love from my family and friends.

Twitch kept me sane throughout my stay. All my streaming buddies reached out and wished me well which all contributed to making me feel better.

Day 10:

I am typing to you all from my phone! This is probably the longest thread I have ever written on Reddit and I don't normally post much but I wanted to share my story because this will stick with me for the rest of my life.

Each day I'm feeling more and more strong. My pain still sucks but it's getting less severe and I haven't bled since! I'm out of hospital being taken very well taken care of by my mother.

As cliché as it sounds, this whole experience made me very grateful not only for my life, but more importantly the doctors, nurses, surgeons, paramedics etc. that go through so much stress to help us fellow humans live the lives we live.

I can't wait to be back in full health and hopefully I can play some games and get some streams in before I go back to work! ;)

TL;DR: I got the procedure of getting my tonsils out. Unfortunately due to complications I needed multiple emergency surgeries. After a few days of rest from the second procedure, I started to bleed excessively. Which quickly made me faint turning the hospital into a code red state. I lost a significant amount of blood and I was prepped for a third and final procedure that saved my life.

EDIT: A small amount of you requested my Twitch, here it is: twitch.tv/wristyplum :)

Thankyou so much for all the kind words. I really did not expect this to blow up as it has. Y'all are so nice!

EDIT 2: You guys have asked for an update so here it is:

I'm feeling so much better, the pain is no where near as bad! Today was the first day I woke up and didn't straight away need painkillers, I'm able to eat whole meals with a side of water to help wash it down.

"Exwife is going off the deep end. This is in NJ, USA. Can I do anything here?","I get my daughter every other weekend. She's 9 years old and her mother bought her a cell phone, obviously to keep tabs on my daughter. 

This weekend, we were watching a movie when I got a text from my ex wife asking to speak to my daughter. 

Now, I don't attach myself to my phone (unless I'm working) and I got the text about 30 minutes after it came through. 

When I saw it, I told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and I also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that I told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

The movie ended around 9:10 pm and I had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. I told her I'd be up to tuck her in. 

I went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. 

He mother was SCREAMING into the phone ""YOU TELL HIM FUCK YOU! YOU CAN SAY THAT! I SAY ITS OK FOR YOU TO TELL YOUR FATHER FUCK YOU!!""

I took the phone from my daughter and I said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

She yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn't true at all. 

I asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. My ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

I handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear ""daddy is going to leave the room now, please don't stay on the phone long, it's way past your bedtime."" (Bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was Saturday night so I bent the bedtime a bit). 

I had to get my stepson to bed (he's a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

I walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she's repeating ""I'm sorry"" into the phone. I fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

I walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

It wasn't until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. She had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

I sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. She was really upset and wouldn't speak much. I hugged her. My daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. 

I'm sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. Divorce is hard enough on children, and I think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be.

AITA for not wanting my wife's other child,"On mobile and all that, so sorry about that.

Ok, I'm in this dilemma. When I met my wife 10 years ago, she had a 1 year old. His real dad is a complete dumpster, never wanted to have anything to do with her or her son.
I love them both, and I marry her a year later. Then we have another son, B, who is healthy and amazing. For three years, we're all happy. We were saving for a house, both working, and taking care of our two boys.
Then we hit a rough patch. Money is tight, with daycare and neither of us had gone to college, but we're doing well, established in our respective industries. Then she starts to slip, spending time out of the house more, going out with friends. I'm ok with this, since she didn't have a traditional post high school life since she was pregnant her senior year of high school. But then she goes silent, and we rarely talk. Then on a Tuesday, she announces she's leaving.
She grabbed some stuff and went to live with a dude she met at work, and had been seeing on the sly when I was home with the kids.
Fast forward a few months, and she's back in town, her and her new BF have an apartment, and has more contact with our two sons.
Then she gets pregnant with BF's kid, C.
Fast forward another few years, and they all live with her and BF and I see my two boys on the weekend.
Fast forward until last fall, they both get arrested, and DHS removed all kids, giving me full custody of my two sons, and placing the youngest with her sister. If her sister doesn't take him, he could be placed in foster care.
Now I've spoken to my son's, and they both are kind indifferent to the youngest, C. C was treated like a prince, while A and B were both constantly ragged on by EX and BF.
So the question, am I the asshole for not wanting to take in the youngest? He's not my son, and I've had very little contact with him.

(I've kept this very non descript because I don't want anyone I know to find out I'm reaching out)

"(OK) Apartment complex that offers trash removal service is threatening to charge me $25 per bag of garbage (15 bags total) that are outside my door if I don't take it to the dumpster myself, but I moved out 5 weeks ago and it's not my trash.","This is a strange situation, so stick with me please. So my lease for this apartment ends July 31st. Early in the spring, I decided I didn't want to renew as I wanted something cheaper. I found a house that worked better for me and the lease for that started June 1st, so I have two places in my name as of right now. I moved out of the apartment in the second week of June and I have been living in the house ever since, while still paying rent for the apartment to finish out the lease.

I get a call from the apartment complex today, saying they've received complaints of trash outside my apartment door (which is where we are supposed to leave our trash bags for the trash service to pick up and take to the dumpster). She said they have a photo of 15 bags of trash in the area near my front door where trash is supposed to be. She said that the trash service only takes away one bag of trash a day, and they are going to charge me $25 per bag of trash if I don't take it to the dumpster myself. 

I inform the woman that I moved out last month, and told her that they are welcome to enter the apartment to confirm I am no longer there, as it is 100% cleaned out. She told me that she will call my neighbor, who with the way the front doors are positioned, puts his trash bags in the same place as me. She said she will check with him and if he disputes it, they will go through the trash and it will be ""obvious who's it is"". 

The reason I am resisting taking it out myself, is that I live on the third floor of what I will call an outdoor apartment building, meaning that when I open my front door, I am outside (versus closed apartment buildings where you open your front door to an indoor hallway). It's been 100 degrees with humidity, I'm on the third floor, and even once I walk down the two flights of stairs to the bottom, I am a football field length away from the nearest dumpster. I am a girl, so I would only be able to handle two trash bags at a time, which would mean 8 trips up and down two flights of stairs, in the heat walking all the way across the complex in the sun.

I have a strong feeling my neighbor is going to dispute it, and they are going to believe him over me, as he is a 40 something year old doctor at the local hospital, and I am a mid twenties college student at the local university.

AITA if I don't want my girlfriend to bring her cat when she moves in?,"It's safe to say that I am a dog person. I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.

I definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.

It is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.

All of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.

I've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.

""Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together."" (They are in the same city as us.)

""No. We're a package deal.""

I tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.

I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?",AmItheAsshole

Update: My ex husband and his new wife made my daughter a back brace out of wood and steel and forced her to wear it (Florida),"**EDIT:** Forgot to add this...My first post was here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4a97dq/my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my_daughter_a/

Firstly I would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive PM's I received. It was really overwhelming (in a good way). A few people asked for an update so here it is.

So a lot has happened since I first posted. I called in to work while I was trying to get all this sorted. One of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. My husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. My daughter went to physiotherapy. Eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. I was against it but the court ruled against me.

I gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. On her second visit it happened again. This time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. The next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. The neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. They had to cut the brace off my daughter. My husband and his wife were arrested. They got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with CPS. My ex lost visitation and custody and I'm working on making it permanent. Unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. It set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. She needed surgery and is still recovering. She always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. I hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. Right now I'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. That's my update.",legaladvice

My wife and I were involved in a fatality car accident with a minor at fault. Who is responsible?,"On Sunday night we were the third car involved in a head-on collision for a vehicle traveling the wrong way down the road. I won't get into the details too much, but there were 3 individuals in the at fault vehicle that appeared to be traveling 10-20mph over the speed limit (40mph). They ended up crossing over the centerline and getting stuck on that side by a small median. The vehicle looked like it made an attempt to jump the median by swerving back towards it when it impacted an oncoming vehicle at which point it did jump the median and both vehicles collided with us.

The driver and one passenger fled the scene on foot, but were caught on Wednesday night. Unfortunately for the third passenger, they left her in the car and it caught fire in 2-3 minutes after the accident. She died of smoke inhalation.

To our knowledge and what has been reported it sounds like all 3 passengers were minors. The only reported age was under 15 so it's hard to say whether or not they had a permit or license. My guess is no because if you've driven the area where this occurred you'd know there are medians on and off along that stretch of road.

We went to the hospital to get checked out as well as the two other passengers who weren't at fault and in much worse condition. Our insurance is taking care of things right now, but will our premium go up if they didn't have insurance? Will their parents insurance cover it? If it's a stolen vehicle will the vehicle owner's insurance cover it? What would happen if they weren't caught?",legaladvice

I'm a bitch to my husband when he wakes me up,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years. We have three boys, ages 4, 2, and 6 months. It's no secret that I am cranky when I am tired, and especially when I'm awakened from sleeping. We joke about it a lot, but this morning he was really upset with me...

Last night, I went to bed at 10. He stayed up, which was fine. He even took the baby downstairs with him so I could get some better quality rest. All good. 

Just after midnight, he came to bed with the baby. (Baby sleeps in our room.) I don't remember any of this, but He says he put the baby down and went to brush his teeth. Baby started crying. I got out of bed, flung open the bathroom door, said ""get this baby out of here, you woke me up!"" And went back to sleep. 

This morning I woke up at 630 when our second son woke up. I noticed my husband was not in bed, and our baby was not in the room, either. Feeling very well rested, I told my husband I felt great, and asked if he slept downstairs. He said yes. I asked why, and he told me I yelled at him and he didn't want to deal with it. 

I remembered none of this. Once he told me the details, I have a vague recollection of what happened. 

I feel really guilty about this.  Simply telling myself to be more conscientious doesn't seem to be working. How do I change this behavior?

EDIT: thank you all so much for all the posts and advice. When Hubby got home, I gave him a big hug and told him I was really sorry.  I told him I really wanted to work on it, and read the list of ideas that you guys helped me generate; thank you so much. We had dinner, I put the older two to bed; he took the baby. After the boys were down, I planned to continue the convo (and see where the one-on-one Time leads us), but he is sound asleep with the baby!  I'm going to let him get that much-needed rest. Will do some research online and see what kind of help there is available for me. Thanks again.",relationship_advice
Shitting on men for not wanting to have period sex is fucked up,"Woman here, I have been menstruating for many years.

If a man doesn't want to get my blood all over him and have to clean up what looks like a crime scene after we are done, I do not blame him. Women claiming that men are immature for not wanting to have period sex are just looking for someone to call sexist. Blood is gross, people don't like it. Get over it.

WIBTA if I wrote my in-laws a letter to explain why I'm divorcing their daughter?,"My in-laws are decent people, and very traditional. I'll keep this simple, but she's a raging violent alcoholic and is having two ongoing affairs *right now.* I don't know what she's told them, but I would like them to know what I've been putting up for the past few years. 

The marriage is well beyond done, there's no chance that either of us have any desire to work on saving it. I played that game and lost. 

Bottom line, grandparents will still be in the kids' lives, and I want them to know that I'm NTA.  I don't need them poisoning my relationship with my kids based on whatever bs she's told them, because there's no way they know the truth. 

So, WIBTA?

EDIT:  There's some amazing people in this place, and I've gotten a great variety of viewpoints on which way to proceed. I appreciate all your comments, and many of you have shifted my point of view away from doing it with my own reputation in mind. 

What is sticking with me is no matter how I choose to have the conversation, which will likely be by phone, it can't  focus on the ""who wronged who"" and the details of what she's done. I do believe that they have to have an understanding of nature of the alcohol abuse and reckless behavior so that they can be there for her when things get worse, or if she should finally seek help. 

If things get worse, God forbid, then I have absolutely no problem whatsoever with protection orders and modifications of custody. I have good legal council who's helped me through this so far.

AITA for telling my brother to stop complaining about child support since he chose to have sex with a woman he barely knew?,"My brother (26/M) has a one year old son with a woman he was never in a relationship with, apparently they were friends with benefits. 

Long story short she got pregnant, he wanted her to abort and she refused, she had the baby, he got a DNA test confirming he's the dad, now he pays child support. They share custody. 

I had dinner with him the other day and as usually he bitched about how child support is unfair, etc. I told him for the first time that it's his fault. He chose to have sex knowing the risk of pregnancy. He got mad and said it's not fair because women can abort but men can't, I told him he knew that before he has sex with her but he still risked it. He called me an asshole, but I was just being honest.

"[NYC] We made a child protective services report on another tenant in our building, and now they and their extended family (who rent multiple units) are acting menacing towards us. We had to get a police escort out of our apartment this morning. What rights/recourse do we have?","Around 2 this morning, we heard the babies crying across the hall and the parents shouting at them and what sounded like them being hit through our vents. We called the police, and they said they'd send ACS within 24 hours. They showed up around 5 am, buzzing our apartment to be let in, and came up to talk to my wife (who made the call), and then they started speaking with other apartments and the one across the hall that we reported. Many of the apartments are rented by the same extended family (at least 3 out of 8 but I think more than that), so they all found out, of course, and when we were getting ready to leave, they were all out screaming in the hall. My wife called a police escort to get her out of the building, and even they were flustered, and said that we should call them whenever we're entering or leaving. Clearly, this isn't sustainable. This is a family that has had the cops called before for domestic disputes (one of the men was choking one of the women out in front of the building one night) and for quality of life reports (smoking in the building, loud parties on weeknights that go to the early morning, etc.), and apparently they've been in the building for a few decades.

We signed our year sublease beginning October 1st, so we obviously need to break our lease early. My wife got a hotel for the time being, and is afraid to return to the building, but I'll still need to return to pack everything and get it moved. Do we have a right to get our security deposit back? Are there any other steps we should take? It's unlikely that all of the units could be evicted (though I wouldn't be surprised if the landlord would be happy to, seeing as he could likely raise the rent on the units significantly), so no matter what, we'd be unsafe in the building.",legaladvice
A good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. Now his adult son is suing me (Virginia).,"So basically, I lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. He was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. We watched football together, drank together, and all that. I even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. The point, I guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. I think this point is important.




He recently passed, which sucks. Then I learned he left me a little something. That little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since I had no idea he had that kind of money. That 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. So it's not like I'm getting the majority of his estate. But then his son, who I'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  I ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




I have three things going for me:




1. My friend was mentally acute. He had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. Our town's not big, and I know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. Hell, I even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. These people can be witnesses I think, though I don't know how civil suits work.


3. His adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. She came around from time to time, and knew her dad and I hung out and stuff. The first time I met her, her dad and I were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the South so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





Basically, my point is he and I were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? Also, what kind of lawyer should I hire? The lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but I don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





Edit: You guys were right. The son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. The letter had a bunch of legal terms, so I didn't get the gist when I first read it. I'll be contacting a lawyer ASAP.",legaladvice
TIFU by sleeping with a married woman.,"So, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. NSFW or for anyone, really. And I may not be alive much longer, because I'm probably going to be murdered.

I'm at the bar the other night, watching the Hall of Fame Game. After it's over, I go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before I Uber home. This girl sitting next to me, very attractive. Out of my league. Like wayyy out. I'm just scrolling through memes on my phone. And she asks me 

""hey! Can I trust you to watch my things and not drug me?""

 ""Uhh what?""

 ""Can you watch my stuff while I go pee and not drug me"" 

to which the bartender said ""oh you can trust Greg, he's really nice"". Annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

Girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. Just random shit. Showed pictures of our dogs to each other. Talked about shows n stuff. Typical 'meet a girl at a bar' flirting shit. She asks if I've ever seen the show Years and Years. I say ""no, but I've seen the band perform live"". So she goes on about how great the show is, and how I need to watch it. Asks if I have HBOGO. ""Yes because I forgot to cancel my cable after GoT"". So she makes me download the APP, so I could start watching it when I get home. Thanks for the recommendation! I'll probably check it out never. So a few minutes later, she said

 ""hey do you live close by?"" 

""Yea, like half a mile""

 ""we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. I have a bottle of whiskey in my car""

""Idk, my house is kind of a mess right now""

""That's okay, I have pets too"" (or something like that. All I was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

""I mean I guess, but I have to be at work early tomorrow""

""That's okay, I can only stay 30-40 minutes and then I'll have to go home""
""That's fine"" heh, cuz that's all the time I'll need! AM I RIGHT, FELLAS??

No. Nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

It's about, 11pm at this point. I think? And mind you, I've only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

So we tab out, get in her car. Which is a stick shift. And I say ""oh no shit, I like you even more now! No one drives a stick anymore! I drive one every day!"" Which I'm excited about, because at this point I'm thinking to myself ""hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows I like, and imma bout to get laid""

We talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn't the first time that this subject came up). Which is just a half mile away. So was a short drive. She parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

Go inside, I try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. While I try to get my Chromecast set up on my living room TV. Ya know, to ""watch HBOGO"".

She runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

It's fucking Evan Williams.

And this is the first time where an ""oh no"" thought crosses my mind.

Kids, I've slept with some strange in my time. I don't know how or why I get myself into these situations. I honestly feel that I'm a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. Sure I troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but I do genuinely care about other people. Being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. But in this case, I was dead wrong.

So after some talking about random shit. We get the show playing. I couldn't even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

Sex.

So after, we're just laying there. Pillow talk. Was a good night. I just got laid. She asked if she could stay the night. We're gonna go to sleep. Everything is cool. I let her know that I have to be at work in a few hours, so I need to get some rest.

Now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. Pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* Right?

Wrong.

I say ""that was great we should do this again sometime""

""I don't think so""

""What why?""

""I don't think my husband would appreciate that""



I am speechless. I don't think I've ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. Millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. Like, how the fuck did I not see this coming. Omg imma home wrecker. I'm probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

Me: ""Ummmmmmm WHAT? Is this an open relationship? Does he know where you're at? Like, why didn't you tell me that?""

Her: ""idk, does it matter?""

""Uh yeah, I'd be pretty pissed if I was him""


Now I've been cheated on before. And that feeling sucks. I've been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. Where I didn't know that I was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. I had found out a couple days later, and I found him on fb and let him know. He thanked me, and didn't get mad at me at all. Cheating is the worse thing ever.

So this is where shit starts to hit the fan. I don't remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

Her: ""we're getting separated soon""

Me: ""well you're still fucking married to him""

""Yea but that's okay""

""How is that okay?""

""He's been..... abusive""


There's a slight pause, then she starts crying. So this is where the sober me starts to kick in. This girl is struggling. She's in a bad spot. And no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. And now I'm trying to empathize with this trashy Evan Williams drinking bitch. Like I legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

Que the panic attack.

She starts going nuts. Ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. Knocking shit over. Basically trashing my house.

She asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. Which I do. She takes it. And calms down. (For the most part).

Now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. I tell her that we need to go to sleep. Because I have to work in the morning. She tells me ""(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy"" Btw, Evan Williams isn't that bad when you're slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

We finally get to sleep around 4? Maybe? I wake up late, she wants round 3. And who doesn't like morning sex. I'm still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. So I gave her a fuck.

Anyways, I need to leave for work. But her car is blocking mine. I tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can't because she didn't know where her clothes were. And told me I couldn't move it because ""I didn't know how to drive it"" 

""Uhh, this is the third time we've had this conversation. I drive a stick every day, I can move your car""

I move her car. I leave for work. And I just let her stay at my house. I let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. Two, I was already running late, and fuck it she'll probably leave before I get home.

A couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. I get concerned, because I'm starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. I came to the conclusion that I should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... BUT, I see that she had already messaged him. FROM MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT! My computer was still logged into fb when I left, and I didn't think to log out or shut it off or anything.

I tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. He lets me go home. When I get home, I find her still naked in my bed. I get her friend to get her an Uber. And I leave. Oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

Go back to work. Thinking everything is over. That's the end of that. Wrong again.

I get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. And only that shirt. Like vag all out and everything. This girl is afraid to go home. Which I'm worried about at this point. Because I want her to go somewhere safe. She's refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

Oh yea, she had me find her phone. Which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. And several others from other people.

She hands me $20 to order a pizza. And after we eat the pizza, she'd Uber home. Fuckin bet. I ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

I kid you not. I'm sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. And she just opens her legs and says ""make it quick""

This bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and I'm just ready for her to leave.

Sex.

After, we're just sitting there, and she starts crying again. Asking to go home. And I'm like 

""I'll get you an Uber home, but you gotta put pants on""
""No""

""What do you mean 'no'? You can't get in an Uber with your pussy out""

""No""


So I gather up all of her belongings and clothes. And try to help her get dressed. To which she refused to allow me to do.

Most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... That ""arch"" thing that women do when you're pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#I had the same feeling when I got her panties ON.

Pizza arrives. I go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. Come back inside. Panties are off again. God dammit.

We never even opened the pizza box. She's saying that she wants to go home. But is refusing to get dressed. I'm starting to panic myself. Because I don't know how I got myself into this situation. But, am me.

She eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that's she having with her husband. And I read through the conversation, it's her sending multiple texts saying ""I'm so sorry babe"" ""idk where I'm at"" ""come get me"". And him saying ""nope sorry"" ""this is on you"" and ""call 911""

That last one though. That's what I did.

Before I called 911, I offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because I knew the husband would give her a ride back there. And not to my house. Because now I'm starting to worry about my safety. I don't want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. But then again she states that ""you don't know how to drive my car"" with it being a stick and all. Even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

I told them that I have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. Etc. I tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn't answer.

The ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. This girl is drunk crying. Trying to get me to go for yet another round. Where at this point, my dick hurts. Also, ""girl you need to get dressed, you're gonna be going home""

Finally got her panties back on, I didn't tell her that I had called the cops. I told her that the Uber was coming. And was trying to get her to put her pants on.

Cops show up, I go outside. Explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. But I kept my calm. I told them that I was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. But they can't force her to go anywhere she didn't want to. She wanted to go home. Officers ask if she was presentable. I pop my head back in the door. She's still wearing my shirt and her panties. So I'm like ""I guess?"", and then I let them in.

She yells ""are you fucking serious? You called the cops?"" 
""Uh yea, you didn't wanna leave. Even though you said you did. Plus your husband said to call 911, so that's what I did""

The officer said to her ""you're on this man's property, and he wants you to leave""

Que crying and what not.

Cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. Which I do. Her husband calls her phone, so I accept the call, and then put it up to her face. Tell her to tell him what's happening. And that she is getting an Uber home. Apparently her card and PayPal was getting declined for the ride. So she couldn't do it herself. They live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. I live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a Lyft/Uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. Once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... Girl finally decides to get dressed.

I had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... I could see the officer's partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. Lol.

Anyways, I hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she's still wearing mine) to the officer. Made sure she had all of her belongings. We get her to walk out of my house to the Uber. But she tried to grab the bottle of Evan Williams. To where I audibly laughed. ""I don't think they'll let you take that""

Cops didn't let her take it. She got in the Uber and she was gone. Policeman handed me the bottle back. Where I say ""usually this is the other way around, ha""

Po-po leave, I call it a night, and it's over.

Flash forward to today. I get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she's asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. I was at work at the time. So I wasn't able to check. But I'm 98% certain I handed those over to the cops. I look for them when I get home. Found nothing.

Oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

So that brings us to now. I haven't heard anything from her. Or the husband. And I'm not sure if it's safe for me to go home. But ya. Know what? Fuck it. I'm glad I could share this story with y'all. There might be more to come, but you'll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

The moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

Jk don't do that.

And don't stick your dick in crazy.

TLDR: Took a girl home who I didn't know was married. She trashed my house.

Edit: I'm not gonna change ""que"" to ""cue"" because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while I deal with mine.

Edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2GIa

Edit 3: her car is still there. Can't get it towed, because it's on a public street. I'm still alive. I see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. I'll get to them when I can.

Edit 4: FML. I sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. No response. Bartender texted me late last night and asked if I used a condom. Which many of you have asked.... And no. I didn't. The girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. So I think I may have been baby baited.

Edit 5: I'm still not dead. Her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor's house. I just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. So I walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it's front of their house... This woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. And she's most likely high on meth. Because when I asked her ""hey do you wanna get this car that's in front of your house towed?"" She said ""no, noooo hehe"" I'm like ""yea, I'll talk to y'all tomorrow"" just wtf.

TIFU by sending nudes and getting cyber-blackmailed,"So I'm 21 years old with a platinum edition V card. I have been trying online dating since I am somewhat of an introvert. I had only ever had 2 dates with girls I met online and they were nice, but it didn't work out. Oh well. About 2 hours ago at the time of writing this I met a girl on PoF who had her Kik username in her profile saying to contact here there because she doesn't use PoF much. I messaged her expecting another bot but to my surprise, it was a real woman. We talked for a bit and she gave off a really flirty vibe. Made me believe she was into me. This is where things started escalating... quickly...

After talking for a bit we were flirting a little and she asked me if I was horny. I jokingly said ""Always lol wbu?"" To which she replied ""Lol same here."" A minute later she sent me a back-to-the-mirror nude (with the Kik camera so I knew it was real), and asked for one back, specifically asking for my ""face and dick,"" and that she'd pose however I wanted if I did. I agreed, and sent it. She replied ""You're so hot <3"" and I said she was too (because she was). She sent me a full frontal next and then said, ""So what do you want to see now?"" I gave my suggestion. This is where my heart sank.

The next 3 pictures she sends me are pictures of my family and I. She found me online. She showed me my full list of contacts on Facebook and this immediately transformed from a late night sexy chat session to full on cyber blackmail. She said that unless I cooperated with her then she would send the pictures I had sent her to everyone on my contacts list. She then showed me screenshots of her doing it to someone else to prove she wasn't messing around. My family and I are Christians, and we were a very close family. I couldn't even bear the thought of them seeing the shameful things I had been sending and saying. I was trapped. Or at least I thought I was.

In defeat asked her what she wanted. And she told me that I was going to sign up to her websites. I asked how many and she said don't worry about it. Just focus on this first one. She sends me a link saying, ""Make sure you register through the link I sent you."" I said OK let me just get on my PC, but she told me to do it on mobile. I wasn't about to argue. I clicked the link, and it was a deep web hookup site that most of us have never heard of. One of those sites where they use your CC info for your ""Free"" registration for age verification. Here's where I started to actually think with my \*\*head\*\* and not with my ""head.""

I managed to convince her that I was working on the site and that Fraud detection was blocking my card from the site (because that does happen) and for her to wait. She said to hurry up. I spent this time screen shooting everything we had said and sent to each other, including the photos of her. I was speed researching what to do in this situation legally, all while trying to figure out how I was going to explain nude pictures of me to my family, because there was no way I was putting my card on the deep web. I gathered all the information I could on her and told her that I wasn't doing it. She said ""Ok. Goodnight."" A minute later, she sends me a picture of her sending my nudes to my Dad over Facebook IM.

I try to collect myself for a minute, but I can't. It's 3 a.m., but this was an emergency, so I called my Mom. No answer. I leave her a voicemail explaining my situation and hung up. I called my Dad. Thank God Almighty he picked up. I explained my situation to him trying my best not to burst into tears because I could only think of how disappointed my parents were going to be with me for the rest of my life. I underestimated them. My Mom was there too and they said how I should proceed with taking my personal stuff off the web, and that they were not going to hold this over my head. They comforted me when I expected them to berate me for being so stupid. They showed me only love and understanding when I expected the opposite, and I almost burst into tears.

I am so blessed to have such a loving family. I won't be touching online dating again after this is all over.

TL;DR: I shared nudes with a girl and was cyber blackmailed. My sanity was saved by the love and understanding of my family.",tifu

TIFU by smoking in my backyard while my dad slept on the couch,"An actual TIFU. 

Typically I smoke a joint before I go to bed every night, but tonight my Dad fell asleep on the couch. I attempted to sneak out anyway without disturbing him so I could smoke. 

I was able to unlock the door and get out there, but I guess the noise woke him up. I could see him through the window as I got outside and as he began to get up I ducked down hoping he wouldn't see me. I sat down there for a couple minutes, and figured he would have already come out if he heard the door open. 

I stand up and slowly peek through the kitchen window. My father is literally standing there in the middle of the kitchen with a fucking gun in his hand, while on the phone. He sees me peek, completely under the impression that I'm a stranger trying to break into our home. I ducked down and screamed for him as loud as I could, hoping he could recognize my voice. I continued to scream and bang on the siding until he ran outside and realized it was me. 

My dad legitimately almost killed me. All for a fucking joint that I had to stomp up anyway because the cops were on their way. They thought it was pretty funny, but I felt really bad because they sent a good amount of cars out for nothing to even be wrong. 

My dad also laughed when I told him I went outside to smoke, and told me he wouldn't have even cared. 

TL;DR snuck outside to smoke a joint. Dad heard me open the door and woke up from the couch. I ducked down to hide, but when I got up and peeked through the window, he had a gun in his hand. He saw me and thankfully didn't kill me.

EDIT: wow, this blew up. Totally unexpected. Just a couple things I'd like to clear up. First of all, I'm a female. Not that it matters, but found it interesting everyone assumed I'm a male. Furthermore, many people read this story and see my dad as a crazy, trigger happy guy who's out for BLOOD!!! I laugh at those comments knowing my dad and how fucking chill and normal he is. If I never peeked my head through the window again, I wouldn't have even known he had a gun. The cops would have arrived and everything would have been ok. Which is why he's a RESPONSIBLE gun owner, and nowhere in this story do I genuinely believe he misused his gun. I think he reacted in a way most people would, which is strange because everyone's shitting on him. Crazy to see how in other countries guns are not necessary and people do not care. it must be a really nice world to live in.",tifu

Girlfriend (20F) and her friend (20F) 'tested' to see if I (20M) I would cheat.,"Errr I really don't know how to feel. Though I'm definitely disappointed if that makes sense. My gf asked to meet up at her friend's house today, so I did. She wasn't there yet, but her friend was. We chatted for a while and she started being playful, but I brushed it off. Playful turned into flirting and I felt super awkward. Before I got up she kissed me and I left right after that and called my gf. I explained what had happened and yeah turns out she set me up. I couldn't believe it tbh, I thought she was joking at first. First she was mad that I 'kissed' her friend, though she literally grabbed my head and kissed me so not much I could do. And I don't even feel the need to defend myself because what? I've never heard of someone setting up their SO and it hurts that she has so little trust in me.

AITA For playing the sexism card as a male,"I work in an office where I'm one of the youngest and lowest level employees along with two others. 
Being one of the low level staff I get asked to do a lot of admin/odd jobs that aren't anything to do with my job role. 

This has never really bothered me while I was the only one at my my level & being the youngest (22) and hypothetically the fittest, however, a few months ago my work hired two girls my age at my level.

I initially thought great someone to share the load of ""crap jobs"" with so I can focus more on my actual work. Boy was I wrong 

Whenever it came time to lift a box or screw in a lightbulb I was always the only option,they aren't allowed to lift a finger and my boss justifies it as ""being a gentleman""

Which to me seems like bullshit 
I don't expect them to be able to do everything, there are some boxes I can hardly lift but they could at least help with the small ones or the other jobs. 

I'm not the strongest either and coupled with the fact I have never had any manual handling training I have done my back in a few times which would have been easily avoided by sharing the job with someone else. 

So anyway we had our annual staff review this week and I decided to ask what the deal was and whether I could split the work. 

I first said that i felt lower than everyone else and I felt it unfair that I was the only one asked to do these jobs despite there being two others at my level.
My boss couldn't comprehend this.
He said ""you dont expect the girls to do this do you?"" To which I said ""yes and I find it quite sexist""

You might expect my argument to have been that they were being sexist towards women by saying they can't do something, actually I went the other way and said they were being sexist towards me for giving me less favourable and harder jobs for being a male

To an old conservative man in England, any notion being ""p.c"" must be like a slap round the face and he basically laughed me out the door 

I don't really know what I'm gonna do next tbh

There's a video of me in a porn video going around my medical school,"Hello folks,

I'm in dire need of advice.

I was called into my associate dean's office where they told me that they had a complaint that I knowingly posting a video on my Instagram showing me and my partner in sexual acts. I thought it was ridiculous and told them that there was no way a video existed of me doing anything sexual and it would never end up on my Instagram. Which, as much as I knew, was the truth. So they dismissed me and told me they'd update me on what was happening if anything progressed.

Today I received this email:

>""As promised I am following up with you regarding the video in question. The attached file was anonymously sent to me. Please advise as to whether, now that you've seen it, you have any knowledge of the video or it being posted to your Instagram account.   
>  
>\-Associate Dean""

Attached to the email was the video and it was exactly what they had described. It looked like an iPhone screen recording of my story with a video I made with an ex 5 years ago that I completely forgot about. I haven't talked to my ex in 2-3 years and it was a pretty brutal breakup so I just didn't think of it but we definitely made this video.

What was really strange, other than it was up for at least an hour (according to the story stamp it said '1h') was that it had these captions on it:

""She sent this as a 'promo'""

""She said she was gonna blur my face but I don't want it up at all""

""Any ideas to prevent her from posting it without getting law enforcement involved?""

So I sent this as my reply:

&#x200B;

>""This is my first time seeing that video, that was my ex of over 5 years ago who I have not spoken to in a few years. I just tried phoning her with no response and just texted her to see if she has any idea of what's going on. Never thought about an old partner having a video of us. To my knowledge, that video was never on my Instagram, let alone left on my story for over an hour, I'm constantly on Instagram.   
>  
>I just changed my password and hope to update you soon. ""

&#x200B;

Followed soon with

>"" I can't seem to be able to reach her. I'm not sure what the video says about releasing a promo or getting law enforcement involved. We haven't talked at all within the last 2 or 3 years.   
>  
>Any ideas of what I can do? Please advise. ""

&#x200B;

I'm completely stunned. I never thought a video like that would come back to haunt me.

My primary concern is to make sure that there is no legal ground to kick me out of school or prevent me from finishing my education as I'm in my second year and more than $150,000 in debt. Other concerns include, can I get in trouble for this? And what else can I do to mitigate the situation?

"(update) School wants my son's Facebook password & email, also wants us to hand over any phone or computer that he's had access to in the last year. WTF? [Florida]","This is an update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pcmwx/school_wants_my_sons_facebook_password_email_also/).

I went to school and asked what's going on. I did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

First, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. Second, the principal explained the situation to me. It had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. Thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

When I asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. I asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

I told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. I told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat I'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

Up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

I talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. He only knew that she had left the school. He showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

In short: they backed off after I made sure they understood that I won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

Small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. Someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. I will try talking to them to make sure. They deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at. ",legaladvice
TIFU by missing my own graduation,"I was supposed to graduate with my Masters degree and had invited my whole family to attend my graduation.

wife's son won't let me have any personal space,"Let me start out by saying I love him and he is great but goddamn I can't stand him sometimes. 

Today I woke up and the first thing I saw as I opened my eyes was his face directly in mine. He then started to yell until I got up and got him food. 

He follows me around the house, stands outside the bathroom and yells for attention, stands in front of the tv while I'm trying to watch, as soon as the tv goes on, without fail, plays under our bed and makes noise constantly, is always running around our house knocking things over, and then comes and rubs up against me while I am trying to clean up the messes he makes. 

A lot of the time he will try to run between my legs while I'm walking somewhere, then gets super upset when I inevitably kick him on accident.
*what were you expecting*

It's not that I don't like him, I love the guy but his constant neediness puts me off from ever playing with him or giving him any attention at all, because he is constantly in my face and never does anything on his own. When I go to bed he will walk across our pillows, he is always just, nearby. He won't let me hold him or sit in my lap but he will always sit next to me and just look at me and it makes me uncomfortable because he will stare at me for an entire hour sometimes. He is constantly bothering our pet gerbils by swiping at the glass and it makes them nervous.

He is extremely hyper at night and sometimes gets me up at 5am because he wants food. 

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I have tried brushing him, petting him, dragging yarn around for him to chase, eventually I just resort to dumping catnip on the floor so he eats and gets sleepy.

I am at the end of my rope and not sure what to do.

WIBTA if I report a guy from the dealership who texted me?,"I (23F) recently went to a dealership to get new wipers put on my car. I was there for all of 5 minutes while a guy who worked there (late 20s M) put the wipers on. We had a short, friendly conversation and then I paid and went on my way, thinking nothing of it. 

However, later that evening, I received a text from a number identifying himself as the guy from the dealership. He basically said he had a great time talking to me, and was hoping that we could meet up some time to talk again in the future. 

This made me really uncomfortable because I never gave him my phone number. He must have gotten it from my profile with the dealership. I feel like that's a breech of privacy on his part, and if he wanted to shoot his shot he could've just done it while I was there in person. 

So WIBTA if I report him? I would have no doubt about it if he had made me uncomfortable during our irl interaction, but we had a pleasant conversation. I don't want to get anybody in trouble, but it just really sits the wrong way with me that he has access to so many peoples information and is willing to use it in that way.",AmItheAsshole

My whole family came over on the weekend and I was showing my 5 year old nephew how to use Google Home to change the color of the lights. Which he thought was the greatest thing in the world.

So cue the whole family coming to my bedroom to see the little guy having the time of his life. He says 'Hey Google!' followed by what sounded like a bit of gibberish. But Google Assistant thought he said 'wank mode'. Which just so happens to be one of the 'joke' routines I set up.. It gets triggered by saying either 'wank mode' or 'jerky jerky time'.

It basically goes like this.

Update: WIBTA if I told my daughter to find a different hobby,"Belated update to a post that was largely considered trolling, but wasn't. 

I won't lie when I say that I immediately ignored the majority of you telling me I was the asshole. Or maybe ignore is the wrong word. I think I expected that from the get go, so being told I ""peaked in high school"" and ""should get fucked along with all the plastic cheerleader wannabe SAHMs"" rolled off my back. But, there were a few of you that did make me think long and hard about my relationship with my daughter and what sort of model (haha) I was setting for her. There was one comment in particular that's been sort of lost to the flood (if you can find it, I'd surely appreciate that) that mentioned my writing and how well it read, almost like a book.

Maybe it's self absorbed, but that's really what made me stop for a moment. I've had to sacrifice a lot to get my family where they are today. I won't get into details because I'm sure it would be boring and pretentious and might make you all feel that I'm just trying to garner sympathy after being such a bitch, but it did involve giving up my dreams in order to make sure there was food on the table. I gave myself some time and space to think and realized the problem stemmed from me, not her. (Surprise) I was bitter that everyone else seemed free to chase their passions when I had to work at things I hated for the things we needed. It seemed childish to me to be so selfish as to enjoy your free time when you could be making an effort for your family instead. That's neither here nor there but it definitely wasn't my daughter's fault that I was so resentful. 

I like to think she was relatively unaware of my concerns with her hobbies (I never voiced my opinion one way or another and always drove her to Michaels) but I can say with certainty that our relationship has only improved in the last few months. I helped her build a miniature restaurant last Saturday and I've got a fun little carnival on my nightstand as I type this. I can't regain the time I've lost, but I can make sure she doesn't have to live the life I'm currently living.

Yesterday I got invited to her place, things were going great... she turned on the TV and we were watching some movie about poverty-stricken family, in the plot it was around Christmas time.

After a few minutes there was a part where the family was eating Christmas dinner. My girlfriend made a nasty comment which was something like: ""Look at that crap dinner."" I didn't really react to her comment.

The mother in the movie brought the turkey and my girlfriend said ""That looks like cow's placenta."" that's when I sat up and said ""Are you serious?""

I told her that not everyone has the luxury of a ""fancy"" Christmas dinner, I told her to look at the real image, they have at least they have their significant others, it's not about the presents and all after all...

Then she said something along the lines of: ""Yeah, that money you spent on food to donate to charities on Christmas day could have been used to fund me a better gift.""

TIFU (UPDATE!!) deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.,"Amidst the hate and questioning of my sexuality, there was actually some fantastic advice in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c5toeo/tifu_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my_new/). I came into the office today with a pretty clear idea of what I was going to say. I felt okay with myself, but holy shit the closer I got, the more fucking petrified I became. The walk from the front door to the edit bay was a total blur, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I kept going back in my head whether or not it was better if she was already in the office or if I was in there first, and maybe if I was first it would seem more intimidating. My mind was going nuts. I got back to the edit bay and peaked in and she was already there, and turned around and saw me kind of creeping in. Just a fucking horrible way to start this.

&#x200B;

Then, I proceeded to absolutely butcher my eloquently preplanned speech. I honestly wish I could tell you all exactly what I said but I really don't remember. I know I apologized, I said something along the lines of each of us probably don't want to ever have to look at each other again, and I did say that if she felt uncomfortable being here, I'd be happy to help her find another job. She asked if I wanted her to leave and I said of course not.

&#x200B;

She was kind of looking down the whole time and after I finished my word vomit, she just kind of shook her head and said ""what are the fucking odds."" We both started laughing and I came a bit more back to reality and asked again if she was comfortable working together and she said she was. We agreed it might take a while to actually look at each other but luckily our desks have us back to back, Ugh.

&#x200B;

I got coffee and came back and she had music on and we kind of worked for a few without speaking but the mood was definitely lighter. Then she asked if she could ask me a few questions. Ohhh boy, lol, but sure.

* When did i learn i could do this?
* Have i ever done this for a crowd before?

and of course...

* Does it feel like sucking dick or getting your dick sucked?

and..

* Are you bi? Do you think it's kind of gay?

&#x200B;

I obliged, I think being back to back helped us talk it out and kind of laugh about it.

&#x200B;

I asked her how long she has known my friend for. (They met in college). She said that she has always been a bit crazy and a bit of a freak. She said when she told her that this guy she was dating could suck his own dick, she was not at all surprised. I got the feeling this wasn't the first bizarre scenario she had gotten her in.

&#x200B;

I really wanted to ask her if she enjoyed herself but I was worried it was teetering on sexual harassment and honestly working in such close quarters I don't think I want to know the answer.

&#x200B;

So there you have it.

&#x200B;

Oh and no, I do not know if she's on Reddit. I felt like asking would have drawn attention to it, but there was no mention of my post or anything like that.

&#x200B;

tl:dr - I did my best, she did hers, it's awkward but it'll all be okay.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Okay, I'll answer the questions.

I learned with my girlfriend in college.  We were very experimental, and somehow it led to this.  It's been a party trick of mine, lol, since.

&#x200B;

Never done it for a crowd before, no.

&#x200B;

(from the original post)

Since everyone is asking, I'll offer my thoughts. No, I'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before. Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex. It's my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward. By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

&#x200B;

As for the ""I've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - I bring it back to the above statement. A handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off. Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc. I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice. But it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful. Better than jerking off that's for sure.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:  Guys, ""party trick"" is just a saying.   This is the only party I have ever done this.

&#x200B;

EDIT 3:  No, there are no videos or photos.  But if you live in LA I might give you a private show if you can somehow make my life more awkward.",tifu

He was not happy that she was there, I told him that's the only way I'll speak is if she's there because I don't think being alone together is appropriate.
First of all, he went on a tangent about how I should never of made that post and that I was stupid to do it, he's asked me like 1000 times to remove it, because I changed the password to the account before I made the post he's extremely angry he can't take it down. He was focused on that at the beginning until our conversation progressed, and he was getting incredibly irate such as pacing back and forth, huffing and puffing, throwing things. Whenever he made accounts, he would always make sure that everything to do the account was in his control. 
For those of you who didn't read the comments previously, or for those who just wanted more info, when me and him were together he would have me make accounts which were solidly adult content. 

First of all it started with a Tumblr where he would post the content we'd make together such as pics/vids and share them with his friends and brag, then that progressed into making me Reddit accounts where he'd have me post any sexual experiences we'd had together or sexual experiences that he'd planned for me. Most of which, I weren't comfortable with. I mentioned last time in the comments he'd use phrases like ""If you love me, you'll do it"", ""You know how happy it would make me"", ""You'll enjoy it"", ""vanilla is boring, you don't want me to be bored"", and those are just the ones that stick in my mind, there's more. He'd use those phrases to get me to engage in certain sexual behaviour, he'd involve his friends, have us do CNC, specifically plan for something to happen and do so he could then get me to write a detailed post about it. The public posting of the experiences got him off and I wanted to make him happy.
And before you mention as multiple people have on the first post - this current account which I'm posting this on, he made and had me use during our break up and he asked me to delete all the other accounts and posts and instead repost them on this account. Stupidly I didn't question his intentions and I know I was naive, I just thought as I hurt him it was the least I could do. Obviously to him, that meant he still had some sort of control over me even despite our break up. Also him not having access to it anymore really fuelled him.

We spoke about our sex life, and I asked him why he treated me like basically a sex toy, why he would pressure me into doing all of those things when he knew I was apprehensive, and he denied it. Said there was no pressure from him, just that he thought I would enjoy all those things and I'd want to do them with him because the thought I would want a 'healthy' sex life (his words). Honestly, by this point when he was talking I could just see through his bullshit, and it was having no affect on me anymore, just making me angry. Just from that, I started to feel a bit more sane and like I could finally stand up for myself and like my feelings for him were no longer blinding me. I was just angry that he would blatantly lie to my face, we argued over it and in regards to that he snapped at me and said ""you should consider yourself lucky that I've not put any of what I have on you on social media, I could ruin your life but I choose not to because I love you and I'm not that type of person""
Like, fucking really? Who even says that? That's such a passive threat. So, now I'm expecting that to happen some point soon.

Then the conversation moved onto that god damn ring. I told him that it was inappropriate and unfair of him that after 7 MONTHS of no romantic contact or talk, that he would propose out of the blue. I told him I didn't want to marry him, or even be with him now. He didn't like that, and got aggressive with me. Told me I'd never find anyone like him, how no one would ever marry me especially because I can't have kids so I'm useless to most men so I should marry him because he ""loves me more than life"" and would never hurt me, all whilst getting up in my face and poking me on the forehead, obviously in an attempt to make me feel small and like he's in charge. 
I kept telling him on what planet does he think he can do all this and then just expect me to roll over and take it? And his response was ""you did for 4 years"". So, the majority of you were right, to him I was literally just some inexperienced girl who he could manipulate and take advantage of, he clearly didn't love me. And all of this actually hurts, because I genuinely loved this person, and now I'm confused about how I could've been so naive to not notice anything. Part of me thinks I was so preoccupied with ending up like my parents that I missed all the warning signs and like many of you said - it became a self fulfilling prophecy. 

I gave him the ring back and told him I don't want to see him anymore, he then turned to begging after he realised intimidation wasn't working. Literally, him on his knees with crocodile tears and his arms wrapped around my legs telling me how much he loves me, he'll buy me whatever I want (I've never been financially dependent on him, I have my own place) and do whatever I want him to do to make it right. I told him there's nothing I want from him anymore and that I want him to leave, and just like before he flicked back to being aggressive. It wasn't poking me in the face or anything, he was 'hugging' (more like restraining) me, kissing, groping me, putting his hands down my pants/up my top whilst telling me it'll make me feel better and I'll remember why I love him. At which point there was a knock at the door, my friend thankfully had text her dad what was going on and he came around and asked him to leave otherwise the police will be phoned, and he told him to never contact me again or he'll make him feel as intimidated as he was making me feel. His face was a picture, he really didn't like someone talking to him the way he speaks to me.

So he said he'd leave, in the process of leaving he threw the ring box at my head, no idea why, literally zero point. My friends dad pushed him out the door whilst he was shouting all sorts of abuse at me. And that was the end of that.
Now I'm expecting he's not going to leave me alone, especially after the passive aggressive threat that he could ruin my life, I've asked to talk to my manager tomorrow so I can warn her of what happened and that he may post stuff about me on social media in an attempt to get me to lose my job.
My best friends dad said he'll take me to the police station tomorrow and we'll start a report because he's worried that after what my friend told him that it won't be the last I hear from him, so at least if anything else happens I've started one and can eventually get a restraining order against him.

Thank you for all your advice, seriously. I received a lot of criticism on my last post but I'm thankful to the people that kept giving me advice even when I was defending him and in denial, without you I wouldn't of had the courage to end it. I also wouldn't have been able to see it from a different perspective because I was so far under his spell.
I'm pretty upset right now, because this was my first proper relationship and I did genuinely love him, and now because I know he was manipulating, taking advantage of me and treating me like a fetish I don't really know what to think, and I feel stupid and like an idiot that I didn't notice it. And now I don't know where I go from here, and I'm worrying he's going to get even more irrational, aggressive or weird with me because he's really not happy.
I've already spoke to my doctor this morning about counselling, so I'll be starting the healing process soon. I guess I've gotta focus on myself now. I'll be expanding my friendship group too and letting people know I won't be going to any events if he's there etc, I've blocked him on all social media, I know he'll be here reading this though because he doesn't need an account to read so blocking him will do nothing.
I just hope I can get through this.


TLDR: Reddit helped me realise my partner was emotionally abusive, he responded violently to the break up and a police report will be filed.",relationship_advice
[Update] Dad left us and a decade later wants to reconcile because he has cancer. Am I wrong to be angry?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ax9pfk/dad_left_us_and_a_decade_later_wants_to_reconcile/)

You guys are right. I can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. I resent this man so much. I can't stand the sight of him. 

After I posted yesterday, I was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. To no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. I picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. I heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but I didn't bring up any of our hardships. My mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. I did, I forgave him but that doesn't mean I need to have a relationship with him anymore. Again, my family protested that I'm being cruel and heartless. I'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. I told them I would not be present at any family events if he was there.

My sister shouted at me claiming ""He is our dad. You asshole"". Yes he is, to which I replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. I told them I had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. My sisters need to return the iPhone's that are on contract as I am cancelling those. Driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that I pay for. These are dad's responsibilities now. Ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

I have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. I need a break.

I'm done. I'm done taking over dad's role. I'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. I'm 25 and I need to live my own life now. I don't think this will burn bridges. It's just a wake up call for them.

Edit: I'm not going to ghost or abandon them. They need to become independent now. 

Edit:  I'm reading all the comments. I know I have acted like a jerk. I just need some time to collect my thoughts. I might update later.",relationship_advice
[CA] I smashed a drone in my yard this morning. What can happen to me?,"Obligatory on mobile, etc. 

This morning, as per usual, I got up at 5, got ready, and left at around 5:15. Ten minutes later, my wife calls me saying there's a drone hovering in our backyard and it's making her feel unsafe and violated, as if she's being watched. We have two dogs, but otherwise she was home alone early in the morning and scared. 

I drove back home and found it hovering about a foot off the ground in the middle of my yard, with a camera attached and I assume on. I walked outside with a baseball bat and tried to gesture to the camera for it to leave, and even brandished the bat a couple of times. After it still hasn't moved, I hit it with the bat, which broke the blades off a couple of motors and knocked the battery off. 

I brought it inside and left for work, and my wife was very grateful and felt much better after I left. 

I personally felt that the only reason someone would be flying a drone that close to the ground at that time of morning was to either harass my dogs, or to scope out my home for burglary, so I felt I made a safe and conscious decision to protect my family and pups. 

But now I'm curious about the liability and my research tells me there's a lot of debate about whether it's legal for someone to be on your property that low with a UAV or whether I legally had the right to destroy it. 

Can I be held liable for the damage? If the owners come to my door can I just give them the drone back and tell them to keep it off my property, or will be be expected to pay for the cost of a replacement? Do I have any defense for protecting my home and dogs from invasive cameras and a nuisance danger for my dogs? 

In southern California, by the way.

Edit: thank you guys so much for the reassurances, I promise I have read every comment. obviously, given that it was very early in the morning and I was already running late for work, coupled with the fact that my wife was deeply uncomfortable and felt unsafe, I reacted more emotionally than I probably should have. 

Now that I know it was likely an accidental situation caused by a lost connection, when I get home I'm probably going to look into the device and see if I can determine its make, model, and potentially who owns it. I feel pretty guilty that I destroyed what was likely a fairly expensive piece of equipment, but I do stand by my decision to act in favor of my family's safety. I'm debating reaching out to the owner if I can find them to return the broken pieces but haven't decided if it's worth the risk of being sued especially considering the vague laws regarding shooting down an aircraft. Thank you for all of your advice and I hope either way the pilot takes more care in ensuring their equipment stays in their line of sight and off private property.",legaladvice
"People who write 'r*pe' instead of 'rape', or do something similar, aren't helping anyone.","I understand the intention here. People are trying to be considerate of others who have suffered trauma, and they want to avoid bringing up horrible memories for those individuals. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, I applaud the sentiment.

However, the way they're going about it is entirely misguided. Does anyone honestly think that not putting an 'a' in rape is going to shield someone who has experienced being sexually assaulted from dredging up their experiences? We all know what you're spelling. This goes for any word people do this with.

I think this is one of those cases where a good idea was taken hostage by people who care more about virtue signaling than actually helping the people in question. Instead of typing r*pe, how about just being a considerate person in general, and if someone tells you they want to avoid a topic, be a decent human being and honor that request. Don't do this silly Harry Potter 'word that must not be named' shit.

Teachers don't like Wikipedia because it's easy and available.,"I'm sorry if this is voiced a lot here, but I had an epiphany today when I saw that in a teacher's citation, different Wikipedia articles were all cited. I hate how teachers and professors dismiss Wikipedia as a source because ""anybody can Change it"". I've rarely ever seen substantial evidence of mass inaccurate information on the site. It's so convenient because it's a compilation of all different kinds of information about something edited by different people with different perspectives. I get that it trivializes the ""research experience"" but when are we realistically going to need that if Wikipedia exists?  ",unpopularopinion
"My husband wants a ""white"" name for our baby","I'm Middle Eastern and my husband is white. When we started dating, I told him that my culture was a big deal for me and I wasn't sure if we'd last since I was probably gonna be more interested in someone who had the same ethnicity and values and all that. Not only that, my parents are strict Catholics and he didn't even know what religion he was, he said he was maybe Christian or something but he wasn't sure. He was pretty insistent that he'd try, he chased me for a while and he took me to a middle eastern restaurant for our first date. So corny but I love him. He was really open to learning about my culture and everything, he was almost fascinated with it all. Basically, my life was My Big Fat Greek Wedding - I was partially embarrassed by everything and thought it would scare him away but he seemed to love it. 

We got married and things were going well, I'm pregnant now and we were talking about our baby. Some stuff that he said just bothered me and I wanna know if I'm crazy or was it weird? 

I have pale skin and black hair and brown eyes, but green eyes do run in my family. My husband has brown hair and green eyes. He had bleach blond hair as a baby, like the blondest baby ever and it darkened by the time he was a kid. We were talking about how our baby would look and I was teasing him that she'd definitely look like me because darker features are dominant and he has brown hair too and then he brought up how he used to be blond. So I told him how you know, my hair is pretty much black so she's probably gonna have really dark hair, I don't think she'll have a blond phase. He seemed kind of upset about that because he wanted his daughter to have cute blond hair but I told him it was okay and she'll have green eyes like him and he was like ""no I'm pretty sure she's gonna come out looking like one of you guys"" ... I told him that yeah she's gonna look at least a little Arab. I don't even know what that meant. I didn't wanna ruin the mood so I just continued the talk and he seemed upset in a way. 

We started talking about baby names and he had really cute name ideas. They were nice but I asked him what he thought about the names I liked and he just blurted out ""can we give her a white name? She's my baby too"". I was not giving her ""ethnic"" names. I brought up American names too. I really liked Diana for example, which is Arabic and I know my family would really like that and it's an English name too. I can't exactly go to my parents and be like ""Yeah our baby's name is Jennifer."" Not only that, I want her name to be related to my culture. Diana doesn't sound ethnic and its obviously not hard to pronounce or anything and she wouldn't bullied at school. And it's a ""white"" name. I thought it was the best of both worlds. I would be so open to giving her whatever American middle name he wants but our baby is gonna be 50% middle eastern and 50% white, I think she should have a first name that's connected to both cultures. 

He just got mad and said I wasn't taking him into consideration and he wants to choose the name since I made her look Arab and I got ""my part"" already. I asked him to calm down since we don't even know how she looks and for all we know, she has blond hair and green eyes and looks nothing like me and 100% like him. He just got mad and continued on and then he was like ""by the way, hummus is gross"" and went to bed. Now I'm sitting here in our living room wondering what to do... lol",relationship_advice

Thank you to everyone here for all of the advice and kind words.

I took the ""contact HR"" route suggested since social contacts weren't panning out. One HR department was able to pass on my contact details to the parent of one housemate who got in touch with me. Through her I established contact with the other set of parents and tied everyone together with the Sheriff's Office and county coroner.

Since everything is still up in the air about my housemate's property, everyone is OK with me continuing to live here and maintain the property while we sort it out. I'm absolutely holding my normal monthly rent payment to eventually give to someone as soon as that someone is identified.

Money Absolutely CAN buy happiness.,"If I didnt have to worry about house payments, car payments, student loans, buying food, taxes, or literally any of that, I would be a much less stressed and happier person. I also could have had my pick of colleges and any other shit I want, I could have. And that would make me much much happier. I just dont see how people say that it can't buy happiness. Even if you have mental health issues, you can hire the best therapist there is, and if you're not fulfilled, pay for an education, and do something you like doing without worrying about it not making you money.

TIFU by telling girl I had small penis before I got anything,"So it all started on a date to the movies at a pretty local area. Everything was going well, we made out in the theater, had some good laughs enjoyed food and genuinely had a good time. (as good as a date to the movies could go)

I could tell she liked me a lot cause she kept getting close to me and we had some pretty deep conversations for a first date. I'd been talking to the girl on the phone for about a week before, but she seemed to feel comfortable around me so I was pretty happy to have someone who I could connect too. 

We made out a couple more times behind some buildings and on benches and stuff and kept talking, holding hands, felt like we'd been dating for months but it was still a first date. We met through some of our mutual friends that we originally went on the date with but separated after the movie. It was pretty dark and we were walking on a pretty unpopulated path behind the theater/mall. She took my hand to an alley/bushy area not visible to the main road. She looked at me in the eyes kissed me and said ""can I go down?""

I said yes! ""but I'm not gonna lie it's not that big, like at all"" I KNOW I FACEPALMED INSTANTLY! She said ""Oh... well, maybe it's not time then?"" She got back up and said ""Sorry I asked..."" I didn't say anything cause I was just freaking the fuck out.

The entire date from there was awkward and I could have easily just said ""no it's fine"" but I didn't. Today is a regretful day ladies and gentleman... a regretful day indeed.

TL;DR: Was about to get head from a girl, told her my dick was small and she didn't really wanna do it anymore. 😭

EDIT: Thanks everyone for all the hilarious comments and confidence advice! I didnt expect to blow up as now everyone knows I have a small dick 😂. 
BAD NEWS: I texted her the next day and she hasn't responded yet, I hope we didn't lose her 😞


EDIT: This blew up even more! And I got some gold and plat! Love you all! A lotta people admitting they have small dicks 😂 

UPDATE: She did respond to my texts a day later saying she had fun but she wasn't sure if she was ready for a relationship... I think my mistake has caused a failed relationship! When we were on the date she was very happy and seemed like she wanted to go further too. F in the chat please 😞",tifu
TIFU twice by grabbing a new coworkers boob and then forgetting her husband died,"   Happened an hour ago on lunch, so a real tifu for you guys. On Wednesday's our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it's a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. It is normal to carpool all together and naturally I drive my two friend-coworkers each time. However this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we'll call her Sarah (changed). She's quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. While everyone is leaving the office for lunch I offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. Now here's where the first fuck up happens.
   While on the way to the restaurant Sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. Everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. Traffic comes to a halt and I slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. I check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing I am currently full on honkin Sarah's right knocker my words start to trail off. ""Damn I hope everyone is oka....."" that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. Amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that I was just reacting to the situation. For the next few minutes the car was silent until Sarah said ""that's funny I haven't had that much action in a while"" which eased the mood and the car all laughed. And fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying ""ahh well we all have our dry spells."" Something I thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. She goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. 
   We get to lunch and everything seems okay but Sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so I ask what's up. She told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. I instantly apologized saying I had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that I was sorry. She said she didn't care about that and that it was fine it's just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. My heart sunk. I had completely forgotten about her husband. I felt so bad I instantly started apologizing for everything in the world I felt horrible. My friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. Sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. I feel so horrible that I have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. Please reddit help me feel a little better.

AITA for telling my son that if he changes his last name then I'm no longer his Father?,"Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we'd adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn't find out until 20 years later. 

Tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he's not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. 

He's an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It's been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he's busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it's been completely different since he found out about Chris.

I couldn't stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn't matter. Any time we'd actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I'd ask him how classes or friends were and he'd just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn't even mention it to me until a year later. 

I told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he'd do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.

What was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris' because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I told him this ""I can't believe you are going to do this. That's really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I'm no longer your Father and I don't want to be involved in your life."" 

He hung up on me. I didn't even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn't respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he's 22).

My family told me I'm being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it's reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?

INFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn't speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn't contact me. I didn't contact them. I needed a break.

Edit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he's been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. 

I never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

I told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son's inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this ""Adam, you haven't been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn't sit well with me. That's the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I'm not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend."" Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

He was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex's affair. I don't know if that's the real reason he's so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for not warning a Tinder date about my weight?,"I've been using Tinder for a few weeks now. My profile picture is a picture of me at the store that I used to work at. A customer came in with a pet pigeon and let the bird sit on my arm, and then I asked him to take the picture with my phone. I didn't use any filters. You can see me from my midriff up to the top of my head, but tbh I was wearing a sweater. 


I am a 5'8, 162 lbs female, btw. 


I met this guy on Tinder and we hit it off. He was really funny and we had some hobbies in common. We agreed to go on a date downtown, to look at pigeons, because he said that he also liked them. When we met he was completely different from how he was over chat. He didn't say anything to me on his own and just answered questions with simples yesses and nos. He seemed angry the whole time and left the date after about an hour, saying he was supposed to meet his friend.


I thought that maybe he was shy in real life, and texted him afterwards to thank him for the date and ask him if he had an omay time. He didn't reply for a few days but this morning I got this text:


>just a headsup not everyone is into big girls, u should rly let guys know ahead of time so they dont get put on the spot. Just my advise. Hope u find what ur looking for, best wishes.


I feel really embarrassed after reading this text. I didn't mean to put anyone 'on the spot'. I know I'm not thin, but I'm also not *that* heavy. It never occurred to me that this was something I had to disclose before meeting someone. But I do remember reading some posts online where people were similarly disappointed that a date was bigger than they let on. Am I one of those deceptive dates? AITA?


Edit: everyone keeps asking me about the picture I uploaded and if it's from weird 'angles' and shit... no. I thought that was pretty obvious as I said before that a customer took the picture of me with his pet bird. I just put it up because people are always saying that 'action pictures' are better than posed ones and I like birds 🤷🏼‍♀️🐦

AITA for ditching my date and causing a scene?,"I'm 19F and my date was 25M, I was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while I was half way through my session. 

I get an IG message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would've found me since my page is super private, my username isn't specific at all to my real name and I have 40 followers. 
He explains he's so and so's friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it's hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so I'm excited and we plan to meet up. 

We catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, I take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. I smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. We're in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.

I study justice so he's telling me how he's an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that's when I freak. he makes a comment about how high I am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point I start to get really scared.
He keeps asking if anyone knows I'm with him, who I live with, how much money I make & how much I have on me etc. Just weird questions. I was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction IMO was much more extreme. I was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. My perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say I was genuinely scared.

I hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so I could be around people and also so he wasn't DUI, he didn't want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that I felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.

I get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he's taking a phone call. I go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene ""I'm really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me"" they catch on and can see I'm upset. I sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he'll take me home but they are very firm. He addresses me quite angrily and asks ""who does your mum think your with?"" The owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. 

I felt guilty since I had gotten along with him and he'd taken the time to see me, I'm not 100% sure if I was in danger and if I could've stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. I tried to have tact in the situation and didn't have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would've been better to tell him I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

Edit: Some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, I'm super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? Correct me if I'm wrong please. I genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there's something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way I did and if I'm the AHole for handling a bad date this way. I see that this isn't as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here IRL I had very mixed and negative reactions. Hence why I got on here and despite all that, I do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying I did the right thing even though it didn't necessarily feel like that in the moment.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by missing every sign on a date,"So didn't happen today, but rather yesterday. I invited a close friend to the movies with me. A few odd things happened, and it wasn't until I spoke to a friend of mine that I realized I missed multiple hints that she was into me. 

1) Beforehand, I jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and I got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). She replies ""Don't worry, if that were you and I, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. I laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) Driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. I replied, ""I guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. She then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in [my car] though"". I then replied ""You know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

3) When we get back to her house, she asks if I want to go inside to get a soda, to which I politely declined because I wasn't thirsty.

TLDR: I missed strong signs that she was dtf


Edit: There is an upside to this however: she's very eager to go to the movies again.

'Happy' is one of the most annoying songs ever written.,"It does not make me happy and I don't want to clap along. It's honestly one of the worst songs on earth. I'm sorry to anyone that likes it but I just can't stand it. It makes me feel really angry when I hear it.

TIFU by masturbating so hard my lung collapsed.,"So a bit of background, this was over a year ago and at the time I'd already suffered my lung collapsing once or twice before. I'm a smoker but apparently it can ""just happen"". But anyway, one night around 4am I was preparing to go to bed, and so did what any man would do once he remembered it was an option and rubbed one out. Now I'm gonna try and not get too specific here but essentially I enjoy certain breath play techniques while I'm at it and I guess I didn't fully consider the fact that my lung had recently collapsed already. Before I could finish I felt the *ping* feeling in my chest and felt a small but painful bubble of air form at the top of my lung. I was pissed. It was 4am, and nobody was up to take me to hospital and regardless I was ready to go to bed so I thought fuck it. I'm not going to let some minor serious medical emergency get in the way of that. So like a true champion, I powered through in some amount of pain until I finished and went to bed. I do remember vaguely panicking as I lay in the dark wondering how big of a risk it was to fall asleep with a respiratory issue but I'm no stranger to stressing out in my bed at night so I shrugged it off and fell asleep.

 I woke up the next day in less pain. I got up, sat on my computer for a while trying to pull myself together (I'm not a morning person and while this was easily afternoon I had just woken up). Eventually I went through to my kitchen where my parents were sitting and said ""my lung collapsed again"" in what I can only describe as a bored and unenthused tone of voice . ""We should probably go to the hospital but I need to shower and I'm hungry so I'm gonna do that first"". My mum looked slightly concerned but at this point we knew the drill. So I showered, cooked myself a pizza and once I'd somewhat digested it we left to go to the hospital.

The overview of what happened while I was there is basically once I finally saw a doctor, they x-rayed my chest to find only a tiny pocket of air and told me it's possible for small collapses to repair themselves and that's what's happened so just go home and chill

tl;dr - had a history of lung collapses, lung collapsed while holding my breath then found out later I slept it off

Edit: yes, I should stop smoking but I don't really want to so I haven't. No, it'a not a great idea but it's my choice, thanks

Edit 2:I've had a lot of nice messages from people but I gotta say the highlight was getting a message from someone saying they hope I die in pain because I haven't quit smoking. All I can say is hahahahahaha fuck

AITA for using the money I won in a lottery to finance my own dream vacation across Europe/Asia besides on my kid's student loan debt?,"On my birthday this year, I treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. After taxes, I had ~$34,000, so I've put $7,500 into my wife's car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. I'm planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, I plan to travel for the month of January and half of February across Asia and Europe. I've never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to Disney World for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.

Well yesterday my daughter Emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. I told her about how I'm financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and Emily went quiet before saying ""instead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt"".

I told her that I'd be happy to co-sign loans for her, but I was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount I promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). She said even after paying that off, she's looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. 

I told her that really sucks, but reminded her that I offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn't want to ""miss out on the prestige"" (she got into Dartmouth). I talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.

She's brought up how the 10k I gave Jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. She argued how it's not fair that I was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.

I told her that he'd be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. Ultimately, the line I drew was that both children get equal amounts and I can choose how I want to spend my money, end of discussion.

I thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife Amy about it behind my back. Amy tried to ""persuade"" me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months I had planned. I told her the same thing that I told our daughter, and then SHE then got mad and said that I'm being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount I put into *her* car AND the fact that she used ALL of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). I told her this vacation was non-negotiable.

Now I have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. I feel like they're both acting entitled to MY shit; am I really being unreasonable here?

I(21M) got caught lying about my age by my girlfriend(25F). Her anger has mostly subsided. But her friend who outed me has been egging her on to dump me. What should I do?,"Last year I got dragged into a meetup for Asian foreign students by my Indian roommate. Btw I am a 2nd gen Japanese-American. We were late and had already missed the introduction stage. The room had already divided into groups and from the corner of my eye I saw this really tall and beautiful Asian girl standing alone holding a big dictionary in her hands. It took me some time to approach her but I finally did. I said hi and she introduced herself in broken English. She was from Korea, a few years elder to me and was doing her grad studies in a university near mine. I introduced myself too and only mentioned my university name which is an ivy league university. She was really impressed as my uni is pretty famous back in her home country. I took her number and we started texting.

We mostly texted about her classes (she is a business grad) and I was pretty good in those subjects too. As days went on our conversations got deeper. After a few weeks I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said yes. I started calling her 'boo' and she started calling me 'oppa'. I thought it meant the same as honey or babe or something in korean.

It was only after a few more months that I came to know that something was wrong. My roommate overheard her calling me oppa on the phone. He asked me that whether my gf was okay with dating someone younger to her. I asked him why would she worry. And then came the bombshell. It turns out that oppa means big brother in korean. It is usually used by girls to address guys who are older. But its also used as a synonym for honey or babe for boyfriends who are elder to their girlfriends. It cant be used for guys who are younger than their girlfriends. Also, it turns out that age is a pretty big issue in korea.(My roommate watches a lot of korean dramas.)

So the next day i asked my girlfriend about it and all of it turned out to be true. That day she was introducing me to her other korean classmates too. When they asked me about my age, before I could even answer she told them I was 26. Later on I asked her how she knew my age as I had never told her directly. She told me she got it from facebook and was happy that I was older as she would have probably not dated me if I was younger. (I had created my facebook account when I was 10 and put a fake bday ) And at that moment I knew I was in trouble.

I was trying to figure out how to tell her the truth without making her so angry that she would dump me. Before I could do that I was outed by one of her friends. My gf stopped taking my calls and ignored me for 3 days before she agreed to meet me. She asked me if I was trying to play with her feelings and was it all a joke. She was very angry and I had to do a lot to convince her that I really love her. I was so scared that she would dump me that I started crying. I guess that melted her heart a little bit. She told me to let her calm down for 2 days. After those two days she accepted me again.

She has decided that she is not gonna let my age matter to her. But her korean friends have already termed me as an american playboy who is going to cheat on her any day.  I am scared that one day she would get brainwashed by them and dump me for good. What should I do?

Edit: I took her out for dinner yesterday. Her friends joined us afterwards. We talked it all out. Luckily my gf was on my side. I guess her friends took the story in a sporting manner too. Though i did feel some glares from one of them. 

Before that my gf and I had a long talk. From what I understood she was just scared that I was just playing a game with her or something like she had seen in many American shows. She comes from a small town in Korea where people have many weird stereotypes about Americans in general. Anyways we sorted it all out. I told her about my fears too. To that she said if we were to ever break up it would be because of something between us and not because of someone from outside.

Btw my roommate suggested me to call her 'noona', so I did but she straight up got angry at that stuff.  It seems I have a lot to learn. I can also see that sometimes she gets conflicted in the way she addresses me but I find it cute.

Thanks for all the advice. I was in a very bad mental state when I wrote this post. She is like my first girlfriend whom I would really wanna marry. To lose her would really break me apart. I know I am a man and stuff but this is one of the places I can really let it all out.",relationship_advice
AITA for lying about an allergy at a restaurant and ending up at the emergency room?,"I met this girl on Tinder and we really hit it off. I asked her out on a date to a cozy restaurant in our small town (Gainesville, FL). 

I had to take the bus there (my moped broke down last week which is another story of its own) and she lived close the restaurant so it was convenient. 

The date was going ok. It was kind of awkward at first because we just talked about the cold weather for 5 minutes -- so I decided to break the tension. A while ago, I heard about a life pro-tip where  if you order French fries at a restaurant  without salt, they have to make a fresh batch for you. I've been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. 

When the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. I then asked the waitress, ""Does the Guac have onions?"" To which she responded, ""Yes, it does"".  I then proceeded to tell her, ""I have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?"" I told her I have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. After the waitress left, my date asked me, ""are you really allergic?"" To which I said ""no :D, but this way, we get fresh guac"". She was pretty impressed like ""damn, I'm stealing this one"". When the guac came in, I asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. 

The rest of the date went well. We ordered some drinks first and then food later. What I forgot to do when I was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. When I got my dish, I took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! She thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. I didnt know how to react so I just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. Her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so I tell him that I forgot to mention not to put onions and that I have a severe allergy. 

The first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  

(Side note: I don't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. I have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but I know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, I thought it makes you cough a lot, I don't know why I thought that.) 

Cutscene to now: I start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. I tell him, ""I barely got any onions in the bite"". My date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. I told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that I'm okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. I asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (Not like we ate anyway) but I still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. 

After leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. I shot my shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. Now it is important to note that the bus stop where I grab my bus to go home is RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RESTAURANT. I'm sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on Reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. He thinks that I am taking the bus to the emergency room.  

He kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. He felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. I finally gave up and told him , ""Okay"". In my head, I thought I'd just let him drop me there and then I'll take an uber back home. However, we get there AND HE WANTS TO COME IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK.  I'm like hey man, trust me, IM OKAY. Nothing is going to happen to me. You can leave. It was so awkward. We were parked and he kept asking if I'm sure and I'm like yes I'm sure don't worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. 

At the end he said he'd just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. We walk in the emergency room and I'm the only person there. Great. I had to walk to the nurse and tell her that I might be having a slight allergic reaction. Supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and I'm like yes, everything is going to be okay. ""Thank you so much for everything."" He gives me his number and tells me to inform him once I'm out. 

Here I am. A healthy 25 year old adult. Having to pay $500 to visit a fucking emergency room for no fucking reason: http://imgur.com/tfU3k5g
Another nurse came up to me to take my vitals and the doctor asked what was wrong and I had to sheepishly tell him, ""I think I might have been having an allergic reaction"". He says, ""Are you allergic to anything?"" And I go ""No"". 

He gave me a benadryl and sent me out. I then spent another $25 to Uber home. I told what happened to my friend and she said I was the worst kind of asshole. I learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy, but I don't think I was an asshole because I did try to avoid as much confrontation as possible, and even ensured the waitress and supervisor that it was all my fault.

TIFU by enraging the parents of my girlfriend by pretending not to know what a potato is.,"Let me tell you that I have made a bad mistake this evening. 

My girlfriend (who let me tell you is only my 2nd girlfriend of all time) said I am ""invited to dinner"" with her and her parents. I was very aghast, nervous, and bashful to be invited to such a situation. But I knew it must be done. 

I met them nicely, I should tell you, and it started off in a good way. The idea slapped my mind that I should do a comic bit, to make a good impression and become known to them as a person who is amusing. 

When I saw that baked potatoes were served I got the idea that it would be very good if I pretended I did not know what potatoes was. That would be funny.

Well let me tell you: backfired on my face. I'll tell you how. 

So first when the potato became on my plate, I acted very interesting. I showed an expression on my face so as to seem that I was confused, astounded but in a restrained way, curious, and interested. They did notice, and seemed confused, but did not remark. So I asked ""This looks very interesting. What is this?"" 

They stared at me and the mother said ""It's a baked potato.""  And I was saying ""Oh, interesting, a baked....what is it again?"" 

And she was like ""A potato."" 

And I was like ""A 'potato', oh interesting. Never heard of a potato, looks pretty good."" 

And then they didn't see I was clowning, but thought I really did not know what is a potato. So I knew I would be very shamed, humiliated, depressed, and disgusted if I admitted to making a bad joke, so what I did was to act as if it was not a joke but I committed to the act of pretending I didn't know what a potato is. 

They asked me, VERY incredulous, did I really not know what a potato is? That I never heard of a potato. I went with it and told them, yes, I did not ever even hear of a potato. Not only had I never eaten a potato I had never heard the word potato. 

This went on for a bit and my girlfriend was acting very confused and embarrassed by my ""fucked up antics"", and then the more insistent I was about not knowing what a potato is was when them parents starting thinking I DID know what a potato was.

Well let me tell you I had to commit 100% at this point. When I would not admit to knowing what a potato was, the father especially began to get annoyed. At one point he said something like ""Enough is enough. You're fucking with us. Admit it.""  And I said ""Sir, before today I never heard of a potato. I still don't know what a potato is, other than some kind of food. I don't know what to tell you."" 

Well let me tell you he got very annoyed. I decided to take a bite of the potato, and when I did I made a high pitched noise and said ""Taste's very strange!"" 

That is when the father started yelling at me, and the mother kept saying ""What are you doing?"" and my girlfriend went to some other room. 

Finally the father said I should ""Get the fuck out of his house"" and I said it was irrational to treat me like this just because I never heard of a potato before. Well let me tell you he didn't take that kindly. 

Now in text messages I have been telling my girlfriend I really don't know what a potato is. The only way I can ever get out of this is for them to buy that I don't know what a potato is. 

I wish I never started it but I can't go back. I think she will break up with me anyway. ",tifu
"LPT: Daily use of the art of UPOD (under-promising, over-delivering) will help your life. Tell your S.O. that you will be home at 6pm and you are home at 6:30pm, doghouse. Tell them you will be home at 7pm and arrive at 6:30, hero. 50% of successful relationships are about managing expectations.","Under-promise, over-deliver (UPOD).  Not new advice, I know, but there are some very specific caveats to be successful at this.    These are specifics that have helped me in my parenting of my 4 children, my successful career in the pursuit of an M.D. Ph.D. in Neuroscience/Neurology, my marriage of almost 12 years, and even my self-confidence (yes, I under promise and over deliver in my personal expectations).  

1.) Realize that under-promising and over-delivering **is not an attempt to be dishonest, it can actually be more honest**, giving you a buffer in case weird stuff comes up (traffic, health issues, the other obligation you hadn't originally factored in). People often tell if you are just lying to them to impress them. 

2.) UPOD only works in relationships in the long term if **the under-promise is still relatively close to what your gut estimate would have been in the first place**.  You shouldn't tell your SO that you will be home at 10pm every evening, and show up at 6:30pm every day, as 6:30pm will be the new expectation regardless of what you say, and what you say will lose credibility.

3.)  **Don't over-promise to try to initially impress someone**, it will hurt you in the end.  If you are like me, you want others to think highly of you, which might tempt you to ""offer"" to do something quicker or much better than you probably can't do (or only can do under ideal circumstances).  This is especially true for people in new jobs and new relationships.  Although this might work out for you initially (you work crazy hours to meet a crazy deadline that you set for yourself to impress someone), it comes with some natural consequences that are nobody's fault but your own.  First of all, you have now set the bar very high for yourself, making it difficult to over UPOD with them again.  Many will, going forward, expect you to maintain that expectation of you going forward.  Second, even if you somehow manage to keep it up, you will eventually OPUD (Over promise and under deliver), which can really hurt you in the end.  You might also come to resent the other person because of their expectations of you (even though in truth, you were the one that initially seeded those expectations in the first place).  

4.) When starting out, **Buffer UPOD with ""I wish"" statements**.  I have 4 kids, and with my M.D. Ph.D. training, I literally cannot make it to all of my children's extracurricular events.  At the beginning of each school year, I remind my kids that although I wish I could make it to every event, I will not be able to attend everything. Every time I show up, my kids are totally stoked.  I sometimes wait until just a few hours before to let my kids know I can make it to an event (even though my wife has a much more advanced heads up) just to manage expectations.  Although some might say that this makes it hard for my kids to feel that they can rely on me, or trust me, I have found quite the opposite.  I have an almost 100% success rate at being to the things that I say I will be at. 

5.) When employing UPOD, **Focus conversations on what you know 100% that you can do.**  For instance, when a colleague is really trying to pressure you to attend a conference that you probably don't have time to attend, reply with ""I really wish I could go, but I probably can't.  Could you do me a favor when you get back and do lunch with me to discuss the interesting tidbits you learned/shared at the conference?""   When a customer at your restaurant asks you to make a specialty order that you are not sure the chef can do, let them know ""I will check with the Chef to see if I can do this for you, but it is unlikely that we can do this.  However, I can bring you some free extra breadsticks that I can see you have all enjoyed so much this evening.""   

6.)  **You can maintain an optimistic attitude while still UPOD-ing to yourself**.  I just realized that UPOD-ing yourself sounds really weird, but my point is that it helps to have realistic expectations of yourself, and to give yourself some buffer.  I used to always tell myself that I would get more work/homework done over Christmas vacation.  Turns out, I was always disappointed at how much I actually got done.  Now, before the break, I tell myself I will be happy to get 10 or so hours' worth of work done each vacation period. If I get more done, I am pretty proud of myself.   For instance, even though I spent about an hour putting this post together, I am only really expecting it to be looked at by about 20 people, with only about 5 or 6 reading all the way to this point.  This is okay to me as if it helps even one or two people enjoy the success I have, it is worth it (also, I plan on sharing some of this directly with my close friends and family).   

7.) **Under-expect in your own relationships with others**, and give people a break.  Realize that thing come up, and that everyone is fighting a hard battle.  Teach them, in gentle ways, how to UPOD. 

8.) **In some instances, it is okay to let them know that you are UPOD-ing**.  Example, tell your friends that you would love to play games with them online this evening, but you are pretty sure that your boss is likely going to keep you after work (because he usually does on a Friday evening).  I say ""some instances"" because excessive explanations might actually get them to distrust you, especially if the explanations are beyond their current level of comprehension.  For example, for some, when a mechanic or doctor starts using words that no one has ever heard of, people become suspicious or resentful of that person.  For instance, you don't need to explain why the pizza might be an extra 5 minutes later, just quote them 5-minutes later and wow them when you get there 10 minutes early.  

I apologize if this felt like a lecture, I just would have loved if a parent or mentor had shared these with me before I had to learn many of these caveats the hard way.    Thanks for those of you that made it through all of this, I am excited to hear from you about what you have learned about the art of UPOD.

Tl;DR:  Under-promising and over-delivering has helped my life, and will help your life, but there is an art to it.

TIFU by playing GTA V with my 3 year old,"This was a few days ago.  My son was down for his nap. My wife works 3rd shift, so she was a asleep.   Figured I had an hour to play some Grand Theft Auto.  Soon after, my son woke up and wanted to watch me play the game.  I figured no harm for a few minutes, since I was just going to do races, or other non-violent things, with the sound off. 

Driving to wherever I was going, he yelled at me because I didn't stop for the red lights.  I indulged him for a little bit until I got to one of the delivery missions that are timed.  Didn't stop for the lights on that particular one.  He became visibly upset on the verge of tears.  I decided that it was probably best to stop playing.  That's when the meltdown happened.  It woke my wife up, so she's upset and can't go back to sleep.  So I dealt with a grouchy wife and an inconsolable 3 year old that kept pointing out my driving mistake.  Now my son notifies me of every light while we're actually driving and gives me directions on what to do.  Every. Single. One.  Yellow lights are the worst. 

TL;DR My son got upset because I didn't stop for the red lights in GTA V.  A meltdown ensued and woke up my 3rd shift wife while she was trying to sleep from working the night before. ",tifu
"AITA for telling a friend's friend that he couldn't keep the ""jackpot"" that he hit on my antique slot machine? (About $700)","I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I'd never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

Well a friend's friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I'd be happy to give him his quarters back if he'd asked but I'm not a casino and while I'm not destitute, I can't afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he'd be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because I've been banned.

Edit2: wow since I'm a ""baby gangster"" who has been running an ""illegal gaming operation"" (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I'm really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

Edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I've lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the ""winner"" thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN'T be this dramatic in real life...I'm a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I'm still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don't be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don't  in the process.

Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I'll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can't ""afford"" to give it to him. 

Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that's cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You'd say yes. Now let's say a guy you've never met says ""hey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I'm taking the whole thing."" You would say no. It's how I've always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I've given people quarters to play, I've taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I've taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That's a nickel a day. that's not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


Edit5: a good question:

>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

Edit6: another good question

>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?


I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

Edit7: 

>INFO
We need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine

So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if I'm way off base.

Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.

> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you'll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say ""your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?""  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

Edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


Edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.


Edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators.

"[CA] I want to divorce my wife of 6 years, who has been a Jehovah's Witness for the last 4 years because of the extreme teachings of the cult, and how it could affect our children (3,1).","So I started looking deeper into all of this amidst my wife and I's simultaneous suspicions that her mentors within her church were ""poisoning us.""  They would bring us food all the time over a couple month period, and we were constantly sick.  Since cutting those people out we have been better.  I want to the hospital to have us all screened, but they referred us to a social worker, who is talking with police on the matter.   

This is when I started looking deeper into this ""religion.""  Long story short, I want as far away as I can from this stuff as well as my children.  I'm a military veteran who is 29, and has supported my family entirely up until now.  I have only been out of the military for a a little over a year now, and have bad anxiety and ptsd issues that have made attaining a job hard, so I'm living off my GI bill through the military (monthly check to supplement education post military -36 months), and military disability.  My spouse is hesitant to work, because the people in her religion tell her a wife should be at home.  

I thought I was being a supportive husband by supporting her choice of religion, but now that I've learned more, I can't.  I've tried to talk calmly about this to her many times, but it goes nowhere.  The religion is designed to warn her about people like me, ""worldly"" people.   She goes on talking about ""the end"" all the time like she is anticipating it.  I hate to say it, but I fear the brainwashing has potentially dulled her sense of reality.   Even after knowing these people could have poisoned her own children, she defends the organization as a whole.  She doesn't want to go to any conventional counseling because ""other people don't need to know our problems.""  I have no idea what do to at this point.

I probably will be supporting our family by my previously mention means while I try to get mentally stable again to work full time over the next couple of years.  I only have about $15,000 in savings, and I own our only vehicle, a fully paid off car.  We have furniture and stuff but I'm not attached to any of it.  I have a life insurance policy that was converted from my military SGLI to a VGLI and that's it for assets.   Other than that, no big debts or anything.   

Over the last 4 years, this is kind of how the split has been raising the kids:

2016,17:  I was in the military, my wife would handle the morning routine with the kids because I left early in the morning and got home in the afternoon, and would play with the kids and help with everything like cleaning, brushing teeth, putting to bed etc.  The only thing I didn't do much was cook, which I only did maybe once a week.  



2018,2019 (post military):  I spent 2018 looking for and working several different jobs that didn't last long, mostly in part to stress and adjustment disorder, and as a result only worked about 5 months last year, which ate into savings. Besides that, we have done everything in terms of taking care and spending time with the kids kids equal.

As I right this, I hide my children's Easter eggs alone in the backyard, as my wife will stay in the bedroom today because of the ""holiday"" she is not allowed to celebrate.   The psychological effect of never having their mom around for birthdays and holidays is only going to get worse, and it's hard on me to have to see them do it alone. What kind of parent doesn't want to have fun with their children smh.   

What is a divorce going to look like with her? I really just don't want to give up my disability pay for life or my gi bill payments for school.  Furniture, car, belongings can be split idgaf.  I don't want to pay her long term.

TIFU by leaving my dildo on my bedside table [NSFW?],"Obligatory note that this occurred a few days ago, and I'm still fully processing this. (Additionally, this is my first post on Reddit - from my knowledge - after about half a year of snooping in the background.) 

Some background: I am a 20 year old female. I am currently at home again, after living away from home for about two years. Moved back due to various personal and medical reasons. The transition hasn't been smooth, as most people who has to move from a more independent state to back with their parents can vouch for, but they've kept their distance and respected my privacy. 

The day I FU begins peacefully. Parents go to work. Sister goes to school. I'm working on some homework for the nearby community college I now go to. 

I'm suddenly horny. Just pops up out of nowhere. Happens to the best of us. Probably due to me not quite finishing from the night before (another unrelated story). Since I'm alone in the house and the day is still young, I decided to do something about it. Lie down on bed, grab a dildo that I had bought online ages ago from my closet (where I keep such things) and pop some porn on. So there I am, blissfully unaware of my surroundings for about 15 minutes and frankly enjoying myself. 

However, I was rudely interrupted by a phone call, which looking at the caller ID, indicated it was from a job that I had recently interviewed for. I promptly throw the dildo aside onto my bedside table, as more important things have arisen for me.

Before the call is completed, they had asked me to come in to complete a secondary interview. ""Would now be a good time?"" I assure them that it was, being that I was utterly free for remainder of the day. 

So I quickly changed into more professional clothing and scurry out the door.

Cut to the late afternoon, my mother intercepts me when I walk in the door from my interview, asking to talk. She sits me down on my bed, and she pointedly looks at the table beside me. I follow her gaze. 

Fuck. 

I had completely forgotten about the dildo from earlier this morning. Even though it was only a fifteen minute session, I am someone who tends to (in a way to put it lightly) get wet and orgasm extremely easily. I've never had to use lube with any partner I've been with. So it's safe to say that the dildo had been completely coated in cum. Which had, of course, had dried over time, becoming a disgusting flakey and sticky mess. 

I stammered something unintelligible out, but she interrupts me and states that she had cleaned it for me, so I didn't have to worry about it.  She then proceeded to drill me about cleaning my toys and keeping them hidden.

Turns out she had come in to my room to drop off some mail that had arrived for me, and had spotted the dildo on the table. Then, she had proceeded to pick it up, cleaned it with toy cleaning solution/water and replaced it back at the same spot.

She kindly tells me that it's okay, but to hide her toys better like she does. She ends her statements saying that my father doesn't know where she's hidden her toys and it's been years. This leads to a more lengthy conversation, unprompted by me, about her sex life with my father and toy cleanliness. 

This is too much for me, and I'm honestly still processing it. I am also thoroughly mortified on so many different levels. 

TL;DR - After getting distracted, I left my dildo on my bedside table for my mother to find and wash.

Edit: Getting a lot of questions regarding this - The job will be getting back to me on Friday! Thanks for the support on this, really nice to hear.

Edit #2: Also getting comments questioning why my mother is hiding her toys. Every family is different, and due to unfortunate circumstances, my mother keeps her stuff separate and private as she wishes. She has spoken to me about it before in passing. My father and her relationship is fine for right now, and nothing huge should be read into this. Just how they operate.",tifu

They've been living there almost 10 years now without any issues.

My sister is married to a top bloke called Campbell. Great guy, works for a mining company and makes a decent living. My sister is a kindergarten teacher and doesn't make very much. This might be relevant which is the only reason I'm mentioning it.

Anyway, it recently came out that my sister has been having an affair for a while now. Campbell is obviously fucking devastated and the two of them immediately agreed to separate and eventually divorce. Now, the both assumed that being my sister, she should continue living at my house (with the kids) while Campbell rents an apartment. When I found this out I called Campbell and asked whether he was okay with this arrangement, or whether he would prefer to continue living at my house (with the kids) while my sister moves out. He obviously wanted to continue living there with the kids and only moved out because he assumed I'd side with my sister.

So I tell my sister the new arrangement and she loses her mind over this. I basically told her in no uncertain terms that going forward Campbell will continue living at my house, whether they divorce or not. 

My family thinks I'm being a manipulative asshole for:

1. Not siding with my own sister

2. Inserting myself into ""their"" problems

3. Doing this despite knowing it will help Campbell get primary custody since my sister can't afford to take care of them + pay rent

I take the opposite view: I think I am doing the morally right thing by not letting my relationship with my sister cloud my judgement. In my opinion, Campbell is the one that deserves to continue living there since my sister is the one that ruined the marriage by cheating.

So yeah, sorry for rambling, AITA?

"Should I tell my parents about the ""thing"" going on between my brother and our cousin","Hi need some advice. I[15F] need advice about my brother [17M] and our cousin [18F] are having sex. It's pretty damn obvious she's into him and everybody knows she has a thing for him she literally throws herself at him. She will always touch him, cuddle him, and (I'm a girl so I know this stuff) she rubs her chest on him whenever he walks by or hugs her. Then she always says ""he's mine, only mine"". She's weird, my brother is nasty for going through with it

So our families don't live very close but we visit each other very often and the visits last multiple days to weeks at a time. The last time we went, they're house is kinda weird . It's basically my brother and I and our 3 female cousins. They have 3 rooms and an rv. When we visit, my parents sleep in the rv, her parents sleep in their room, and all of us kids slee in 2 rooms. These 2 rooms are attached but have no door. She (obviously) said she and my brother would sleep alone in one room and us 3 other girls will sleep in the other one on the bunk beds.

I couldn't sleep that night so I was bored and basically just looking around. I saw AND heard my brother and our cousin banging. Literally as soon as I looked over they were GOING AT IT. I was pretty disturbed so I tried making noise to like get them to shut the fuck up and chill but that didn't work sinve they were too into it so I put earbuds in and listened to music. Next morning was awkward asf. At breakfast, they kept on smiling at each other and it was kinda obvious they were up to something. I was the only one who heard that shit.

TIFU by lying about an allergy at a restaurant and ending up in the emergency room,"*I've posted this on AmItheAsshole and everyone on that thread kept telling me to post here so be aware because I don't want you to read this again!*


I met this girl on Tinder and we really hit it off. I asked her out on a date to a cozy restaurant in our small town (Gainesville, FL). 

I had to take the bus there (my moped broke down last week which is another story of its own) and she lived close the restaurant so it was convenient. 

The date was going ok. It was kind of awkward at first because we just talked about the cold weather for 5 minutes -- so I decided to break the tension. A while ago, I heard about a life pro-tip where  if you order French fries at a restaurant  without salt, they have to make a fresh batch for you. I've been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. 

When the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. I then asked the waitress, ""Does the Guac have onions?"" To which she responded, ""Yes, it does"".  I then proceeded to tell her, ""I have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?"" I told her I have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. After the waitress left, my date asked me, ""are you really allergic?"" To which I said ""no :D, but this way, we get fresh guac"". She was pretty impressed like ""damn, I'm stealing this one"". When the guac came in, I asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. 

The rest of the date went well. We ordered some drinks first and then food later. What I forgot to do when I was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. When I got my dish, I took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! She thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. I didnt know how to react so I just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. Her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so I tell him that I forgot to mention not to put onions and that I have a severe allergy. 

The first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  

(Side note: I don't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. I have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but I know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, I thought it makes you cough a lot, I don't know why I thought that.) 

Cutscene to now: I start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. I tell him, ""I barely got any onions in the bite"". My date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. I told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that I'm okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. I asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (Not like we ate anyway) but I still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. 

After leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. I shot my shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. Now it is important to note that the bus stop where I grab my bus to go home is RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RESTAURANT. I'm sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on Reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. He thinks that I am taking the bus to the emergency room.  

He kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. He felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. I finally gave up and told him , ""Okay"". In my head, I thought I'd just let him drop me there and then I'll take an uber back home. However, we get there AND HE WANTS TO COME IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK.  I'm like hey man, trust me, IM OKAY. Nothing is going to happen to me. You can leave. It was so awkward. We were parked and he kept asking if I'm sure and I'm like yes I'm sure don't worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. 

At the end he said he'd just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. We walk in the emergency room and I'm the only person there. Great. I had to walk to the nurse and tell her that I might be having a slight allergic reaction. Supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and I'm like yes, everything is going to be okay. ""Thank you so much for everything."" He gives me his number and tells me to inform him once I'm out. 

Here I am. A healthy 25 year old adult. Having to pay $500 to visit a fucking emergency room for no fucking reason: http://imgur.com/tfU3k5g
Another nurse came up to me to take my vitals and the doctor asked what was wrong and I had to sheepishly tell him, ""I think I might have been having an allergic reaction"". He says, ""Are you allergic to anything?"" And I go ""No"". 

He gave me a benadryl and sent me out. I then spent another $25 to Uber home. I told what happened to my friend and she said I was the worst kind of asshole. I learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy again. 

TL;DR: Pretended to have an allergy to get fresh guac to impress my date. Got served the food I was fake allergic to, and was forced to visit the ER.

TIFU By finding my mom's butt plug.,"This just happened so I'm still living this nightmare. My parents are out of town for the night so my husband and I are staying at their place to watch the dogs. When we got here, we went to my old room and he started snooping around in my drawers. He found old notes that my friends and I used to pass in high school, old pictures, etc. I had my back turned to him when he started going through the bottom drawer in my old desk. When I turned around, he was holding a vibrator. 

Suddenly, it all came back to me. My mom has been sleeping in my room the past few years to get away from my dad's snoring, and that vibrator wasn't mine. ""DON'T TOUCH THAT! IT'S NOT MINE!"" He dropped it and we stared at each other for a few seconds. There were 2 vibrators and a silver butt plug on top of my old school supplies. He said, ""...I have to put it back how I found it."" Apparently he had been rummaging through the drawer and pulled it out of a black silk bag. So I made him use a towel to put it back and close the drawer. 

Now he won't stop popping his lips at me and singing, ""if your mom has a butt plug clap your hands!"" I think we'll have to sleep on the couch downstairs tonight instead of in my old bed. I'll have to face my mother in the morning when we hand the keys back over. 

TLDR: snooping husband found my mom's sex toys and wont stop taunting me about it.

EDIT: I guess by ""face my mother"" some people thought I would be confronting her. I absolutely won't do that because I know how embarrassed she'd be and how relentless my dad would be in teasing her over it.

TIFU by trying to buy an Instant Pot at Target and probably ending up on a terrorist watchlist,"This started yesterday but I didn't realize my FU until today.

Yesterday, I stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt Instant Pot at Target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. I decided I would get some Christmas shopping done early and flip a few. I ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

Well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. I go to Target and give them my ID, they look it up and can't find it at first. I give them the order number and I hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. The one says he has to let the manager know I'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. Seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. The doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. I step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the State Police Counter Terrorism Unit and they start questioning me about why I'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if I know what they can be used for, if I'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the Target parking lot. I did my best to explain the price mistake and how I found it, etc. I think they accepted my explanation but I'm still nervous that I'm on a watchlist now.

TL:DR tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 Instant Pots at Target, got interrogated by State Police Counter Terrorism Unit why I was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.

Edit: here's the investigator's card since so many people seem to be doubting my story. I covered up personal info so I don't dox him or myself.

AITA for playing music over my Bluetooth speaker on a public hiking trail?,"Where to begin with this...

I guess I need to say up front I'm not an outdoors type person. But I was sort of excited to go on a hike yesterday. We are in San Diego for the fourth of July and my cousin said it would be really fun if me and my friends went on a hike while she (cousin) had to work. We went to a place called Cowles mountain which I guess is about 45 minutes away from the hotel downtown. 

When we got there it was pretty crowded and we saw a group of guys coming down who were just blasting rap music. I was like wow that would be an awesome way to not get bored on the hike so I went back to my car and got my blue tooth speaker from my pack and hit my favorite spotify list. 

Most people didn't seem to mind but I did notice that we started to get occasional dirty looks. But finally one person stopped me and told me it was incredibly rude to play music outloud and that I should be using headphones. I told her that I was playing music for our group. And she basically that it's still very rude and against the rules but she kept walking. 

We decided we just weren't going to make it to the top so we stopped at a kind of flat spot and sat down for a while and this is when things actually got kind of scary. This guy and his girlfriend came up to us and said again that I should be using headphones. I told her that we were in a group. She said that it didn't matter most people were trying to enjoy quiet nature. I told her that that its public land. She said ""if you weren't such an ignorant fat bitch you would have noticed the sign at the bottom that said no speakers."" I basically shut down because I'm not good at confrontation but my friend asked her if she wanted to repeat herself. So the girlfriend called her a fat bitch as well and her boyfriend had to drag her away she was so upset. I didn't want any more hassle so I turned off the speaker and they walked away but the girl was just glaring at us and I was actually scared that they would slash my tires or something at the bottom. 

I have been reliving the confrontation over and over again and didn't sleep last night. I admit to being fully ignorant because I don't do a lot of outdoor stuff but was that really a big deal? I mean at least one other group we saw was doing it so I can't be that out of touch? All I was trying to do was make it a little more enjoyable and really meant no offense. 

I posted this on another sub and was referenced here so i'm a little scared just because of the title but please be honest with me. 

Was I doing something wrong?

There was this tramp.,"One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

and still higher...

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

""For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95""

The captain outrageously asked why.

"If you believe in free college, free healthcare and guaranteed income you should have a zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration.","I just don't understand it. You want to give people free healthcare, free food, free college and free guaranteed income and also let anyone who wants to, come here? You might as well just put piles of cash at the border. 

How do you expect a system like that to survive? Social welfare programs only work when enough of the population pays into them. If you're offering all this ""free"" shit and allowing unskilled, uneducated people who don't speak the language to flood into the country it will implode.

You're telling the entire world that if you're pregnant and can give birth here we will give your child free food, free college, free healthcare and free income for life.  Why would they not try to come here illegally? I don't blame them, as future father with a baby due in September I would try and come here too. The fact is you can't take care of the entire world. Just because you may want to doesn't mean you can. 

If you believe in any combination of free healthcare, free college and guaranteed income you should have a zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration. Stopping illegal immigration is the only way these policies would have a chance of being sustainable. 

As a real world example Germany is currently paying immigrants to leave. They brought in over a million people in one year. They can't speak the language, can't work and have no where to live. They're draining the social systems in Germany. So much so that it's cheaper for Germany to pay them to leave. Germany is offering to pay one year of their rent if they get the fuck out.

To answer the most common question, inkjet ink is exceptionally expensive and priced that way because the company's got you where they want you by selling you a cheap printer. Laser printers use toner which is more expensive to replace, but lasts longer. Inkjet ink dries out when it's not used and is wasted. Kinda like running the engine on a car when it's not being driven. 

As for photos, many people have pointed this out and it's a valid concern. Many laser printers do an excellent job on photos and they're getting better, but ink is still king. You still have options.

TIFU by slapping my teachers ass,"So basically I was in class with one of my friends who takes the same subject, he was super energetic and always wearing semi-formal clothing.

This is in my relaxed electronics class where everyone moves around and is always chatting away. So, it's mufiday and look over at my friend who was leaning over a desk with his ass sticking out, while he was talking to another student. 

So I go up and with a huge wind up, slap his ass so hard that he immediately jumps up, as if he's just jumped out of his own skin. 

You see, the problem with that was that the person I slapped was not actually my friend... but our teacher. 

Everyone is at a stand still, waiting for my death penelty, especially my friend whose just staring my down at this point. Now the teacher's face goes bright red, and I'm starting to freak out thinking I'm doomed. 

Except, the teacher just sits down, looks me in the eyes and says, ""Hewy (not my real name but username will do). Save that for after class"" with a big grin on his face.

Everyone at this point bursts out laughing as I'm sitting here absolutely shitting my pants thinking I was about to get kicked out of school.

TIFU by showing my cat a plushie that looks like her,"At the office today, there was a raffle for some stuffed animal toys and I won one. I chose one that looked almost exactly like my cat thinking I'd get a cute photo of them together.

I get home and put the toy on the bed next to her and snap a photo. She doesn't care, but hey, mission accomplished. 

Fast forward 6 hrs and I'm playing Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. I suddenly hear my cat howling up a storm and look over to the bed and she is crying at the stuffed version of herself. She's picking it up by the neck, dragging it around, setting it down, staring into its lifeless eyes, and just crying nonstop. 

I take it away from her but she doesn't stop howling. Her fur is all puffed up and her eyes look so scared. I think she thought it was a dead cat. I open the door to my room and she bolts out and starts cowering in the furthest corner of the apartment from my room. She won't let me near her.

I feel like a villain. I love her more than anything and now she's fearing for her life.

Tldr; I brought a stuffed cat toy home for my cat. She thought I brought her a dead cat and freaked out.

EDIT: By request, I'm paying the cat tax. This is Mushroom and she's 9 years old. I adopted her two weeks ago after fostering her for a couple months.

I (34m) just found out that my 3 year old daughter is actually my brothers daughter. Wife(35f) claims rape but brother has a different story. Idk what to do anymore.,"I'm posting because I cannot share this with my family and I can't talk to my friends either.

Wife and I have been married for 4 years, together for 12. Last month, my entire life was upended by my brother( older ) and my wife. My brother was my hero. He was there for me when my parents abandoned us. He was there for me when I struggled with depression. He's like a father figure to me. 

So my brother called me and asked me if he could come over and meet me at my office. He told me that it was very important. We met up for lunch that day and he told me that he did something terrible and he was really sorry. He told me that my wife had sex with him before we got married because she claimed that she was really stressed at that time and he was drunk. 

Apparently, my wife contacted him recently and told him that our daughter could be his. And he also started suspecting it. I was really shocked by this revelation. Because my wife never told me about this. And I never imagined she would cheat on me.

But when I confronted my wife, she started crying and told me that she was raped by my brother before our wedding and she ended up getting pregnant with his child. She didn't realise it at that time, and she didn't want to hurt my relationship with my brother, so she decided to hide it. But my brother claims it was consensual. 

We ended up getting a paternity test and it was revealed that my daughter is not mine. I just want to kill myself. My brother told me that he would pay child support and take responsibility for the child. Wife claims that she was raped and she doesn't want my brother in our lives. 

I'm really torn. I don't think my brother is a rapist. But I'm also having a hard time believing that my wife cheated. Also, she never told me this. She had a normal relationship with my brother all this time. Idk what to do now. I think I'm just leaving. But I want some advice to cope up.",relationship_advice
Muslim guy [22M] whom I [22F] multiply rejected over the years writes to my friends to find out about my virginity,"We have been attending the same university over the last 6 years and share a lot of common friends.

During the first year of uni, he has asked me out and I declined. During the years, I have tried my best to stay away (as much as possible), however, he interpreted every accident glance as my approval of his advances. I guess, in total, I had to decline him about 10 times or so.

However, during last summer I had made a mistake by replying him on one of his messages (just asking how I am). We have talked a little, and that's all. Soon after I had stumbled upon him near my house. I confronted him again, he denied following me. After that I told him to stay away and blocked him in all social media.

It all has been silent until last month. Two weeks ago my best friend told me he wrote her, directly asking  her if I have ever been in a physical relationship with a man. She didn't answer him except asking why on earth does he want to know such personal information. He did not reply.

Today he wrote to her again, demanding a link to my (hypothetical) boyfriend' profile.

I lost my wits, wrote to him again, telling him to leave me and my friends in peace. He denied writing to my best friend, which is absolutely foolish. I have ranted and once again blocked him.

However, I do not believe this is the end. I am angry at such intrusion in my personal life and a little scared for my safety. I mentioned his religion because he came to our city from southern regions with very ""tradiotional"" views upon marriage and female consent.

He never seemed dangerous or violent in university, just a little slow to understand.

TIFU by asking Reddit which ethnic group to exterminate,"Today I had been looking forward to the qualifying for the Formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing Reddit whilst also watching some older Formula 1 footage on YouTube. So it got me wondering, ""Some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they're just boring and far too controlled"". So I posed the question to /r/Formula1 to ask their opinions also. Shortly after posting, it transpired that the way I had asked the question could be perceived as...A little...'Hitlerish'. Check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. It somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. Unfortunately for me, I am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that I must open every single one. It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn't be able to sleep if I didn't open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT. Probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. I thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where I was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. But then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ USA woke up. And I've been playing catch-up ever since. Took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. Let's see what I go back to now...

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/

EDIT: Thank you for the gildings you're all giving me, it's rather overwhelming.

The original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/Formula1 somehow. 

As of 19:42PM GMT, I still have over 600 responses to read through. I will be reading them all, but I won't necessarily be responding to them all.

I'm really glad that I could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn't the original intention, but it's a great positive to take away from this experience!

EDIT 2: UPDATE - At around 20:20PM GMT, I opened up AlienBlue on my iPad to read these comments faster than on the official Reddit app, and when I started from there I had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, I now have 976 unread messages -.-

EDIT 3: UPDATE - It's now 21:09PM GMT, I did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it's back up in the 4 digits. I am seriously sleep deprived right now, I have been awake since 16:00PM yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. Finally they've subsided and I'm feeling really tired now, so I shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. Goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. I honestly didn't think this TIFU post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

EDIT 4: Finally I'm able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. Back down under 1000 left to go now, and it's been a truly interesting experience. I didn't realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, I also didn't expect some of the truly deplorable messages I have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. It's 6:00AM GMT here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

EDIT 5: Final edit, I'm now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17AM. It's been great to see this happen, and I'm sorry to those who thought Reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

WIBTA If I followed through on my ultimatum of not coming to Thanksgiving because of my sister's awful boyfriend?,"My younger sister (30F) has been dating ""Jerry"" for 3 years. He's a loud-mouth who holds ignorant, bigoted, and homophobic views. I have no clue what my sister sees in him as no one in my family shares his perceptions. Here's what the first Thanksgiving was like with him (he was meeting my family for the first time). he brought up the recent election and called me a ""snowflake"" because he knew I didn't vote for Trump ( I guess my sister told him since I didn't know him before this.) He went on about how awesome Trump was and how awesome this country is now going to be. I didn't engage because I thought he was  foolish, how he had no idea who my parents voted for and still thought it was appropriate to run his mouth nonstop at the dinner table the first time meeting all of us. After more than two hours of this, my mother finally asked him to change the subject. 

Fast forward to now. He has, on more than one occasion, brought up that if his kids ""ever decide they are \[insert vulgar word for gay here that begins with an F\]"" that he'll disown them, and other awful things along the same lines. I'm the only one that pushes back, usually asking him why he'd say that, which usually fires him up even more. There's no having a respectful conversation with him. My sister just jokes and laugh it off every time he says something blatantly racist or ignorant. My parents cringe and try to change the subject. 

The final straw came when he went on social media and made comments about my relationship. He tried to call out my boyfriend and me because we both have good careers and split household expenses. He thinks this is wrong because ""you're in a relationship, you shouldn't be nickel and diming each other like you're just roommates, what's wrong with you two? Doesn't he take care of you?"" Which is hilarious because he's in his 30's, he moved in with my sister who pays for everything after two weeks of dating, only works part-time by choice and has no savings whatsoever. 

I blocked him and called my mother. I vented to her that I don't appreciate any of misogynistic/bigoted/homophobic views and he's a loser. My mom agreed with me but said she wishes we could all get along. My boyfriend and I live a plane ride away and I told her I wouldn't be coming to Thanksgiving this year if he was. I said because they, meaning my parents and sister, just sit there while he talks, that that makes them complicit to the hateful commentary and I don't want to be associated with someone like him. My mom was understandably upset and said I was her priority since she never gets to see me, but that she couldn't tell my sister not to bring him. My dad is sick about this and wants everyone to shut up and get along. I feel I have reached my limit, but some of my extended family members feel like I should just suck it up since it would really crush my parents since I live far away if I didn't see them on a holiday.

[CO] My retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. I fear that she intends to abuse other children and I want to stop it. I have proof of her abuse against me. How do I go about this?,"Between the ages of 9-11, I took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. If memory serves, I believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that I took lessons with her. The only reason I stopped going to her was because she retired. 

My teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". I won't get into specifics, but I have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

I never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

Recently, I found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. I am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and I want to stop it before it's too late.

So my question is: legally, what can I do and what should my course of action be? I don't want money, I just want her stopped.

I have the photographs, but I am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

Please walk me through this, because I genuinely don't know what to do, and I'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because I didn't stop it sooner.

TIFU by not stopping a rumor of me being a school shooter.,"Like most TIFU the major fuck up happened about 2 years ago, but the build up started 6 months before that.

 Let me start by giving you some back story. I went to private school from 4th grade until this happened my Junior year of high school. Before I was homeschooled. Perfect innocent sheltered child… right? Wrong… Major social reject on all levels. Did not make any actual friends until my freshman year of high school and because of being in private school I went to the same high school as the people I went to middle school with. So all the ass hats from middle school followed me and my social position had no hope of changing. Because of this I made friends with the other ""rejects"". You know… the stoners, emos, rebels, budding anarchists, and so on. I adopted every one of these stereo types. Since there were only 300 people in my school, everyone knew me and my five friends. We wore hoodies every day over our uniforms to rebel against our strict dress code, even when it was 100 degrees outside. We were those kids that parents tell their kids to stay away from. And it only made it worse that my older brother was the star quarterback and was the most popular senior in school.


Now onto the real story.


After my brother graduated I (sophomore) was expected to fill his role on the football team (I can't play worth shit). Luckily one of my people was already on the team so I decided to join (small enough school where there weren't tryouts). Surprisingly I actually showed up to practice and gave my hardest, but I sucked so much that it probably looked like I half assed everything. Played about 4 minutes of game time that season… on JV… whatever it was something to do. During summer off season my junior year one of the senior stars told my friend that he looked like one of the Columbine shooters… Being those kids we thought it was funny shit. So we let the rumor/joke continue. 


We never thought it would stick around because new rumors were started about us every day. But this rumor was very different. It stuck around… and grew… by the end of the season the rumor had grown extremely complex and overly detailed… but so far it had stayed in the locker room. (I didn't care). 


I came to school the Monday before Thanksgiving break to find that my friend was not there… interesting… it was rare that we could get away with skipping school. Oh well. By the second period I had an uneasy feeling. About halfway through 2nd the dean of discipline (also head football coach) called me out of class and started walking with me to his office, he didn't say a word. Odd but ok. 


He took me past his office and into the principle's office (even though I was a little shit I had never been here). In here both of my parents (who should have been at work) were sitting with extremely worried expressions. The dean left and so it was just me in the room with my parents. As soon as the door shut my mom asked me what the hell was going on. I ran through my mind all the possible things that I could have been busted for that both of my parents were summoned. I said I didn't know but kept thinking about what it could be... (pot? That kid that tried to stab me the week before?) 


After about 5 minutes of awkward and terrifying silence two detectives entered the room and asked if they could record the interview. My mind was racing and I started getting really scared. They said that one of my classmates was arrested that morning because of a school shooting tip off… (oh shit… this is not good) they told me that the informant said I was going to supply him with the guns to do it. I denied and told the officers that my family didn't have guns and that I was only 17 so I couldn't have bought any… My parents backed me up. The detectives asked the same question over and over again… and apparently one time I worded my answer in a way they took as me admitting guilt. 


The school expelled me and my parents contacted a lawyer and were advised to take me out of state in case a warrant was placed for my arrest. (lawyer would be alerted first and we could discuss possibilities before cops came and arrested me). We took our thanksgiving break early and visited family. 


At the end of everything my friend was 16 so they did not need a warrant to arrest him. He spent two weeks in juvenile detention center and another 6 months under house arrest before the case was wiped off his record. He had to redo his junior year and is still pretty shaken up by it. I was 17 so they needed a warrant for my arrest but they didn't have enough evidence to get a judge to sign one. I got expelled from school and had to transfer to the public school. My parents were not mad at me at all but furious with the school. Both my friend and I are still close friends and we were both drastically changed for the better.


TL;DR. Rumor about my friend shooting up our high school and me supplying him with weapons. Cops got involved, and he was arrested and served 6 months house arrest.

Is it weird to go to your childhood home and ask for a tour?,"A couple years ago I traveled 600 or so miles back to my hometown to see some friends and family. My friend and I took a tour of the town, the elementary and middle school I went to, restaurants I ate at that were still there and even drove past my house I grew up in from when I was born and until we moved when I was 13. 

We sat outside parked in front of the house debating whether or not to knock on the door and see if I could look at my old room and other little things I remembered about the house.

"Unpopular opinion: An entire generation is reaching adulthood without basic life skills(taxes, making appointment, basic home/auto maintenance, etc) not because of schools taking away shop and home ec, but because parents never bothered to be parents.","Every day I come across another person who lacks basic life knowledge in some capacity.  In April, especially, it's all about taxes.  The internet usually takes the time to bandwagon on the idea that schools are the only way we can learn these skills, completely ignoring that the parents have dropped the ball.  When I was 16 my dad sat me down and filed my 1040ez for my summer job(early 2000's before turbotax) and showed me what I needed to watch out for and the value of accuracy.  I learned laundry when I would come home from sports with grody stuff and my mom showed me how to use the washer/dryer.  

These skills that everyone needs aren't the school's job.  I loved woodshop in school and wish they would reimplement it, but how to use a saw or a screw driver is something learned in the home.  How to boil and egg, following a recipe should be learned in the home.

I get that people have non-traditional families and maybe there is a way for the school to subsidize some of these things, but parents somehow get a pass and it always gets me fired up.

Thanks everyone for some super helpful suggestions for a range of different scenarios. Not so much thanks to the many people who inboxed me asking for photos... 

My boyfriend and I went abroad to a wedding this past weekend, a family friend of his, so with a lot of his family and friends. I was a little worried about it because it seemed like a prime time for people to be commenting on our relationship. Well, I wasn't wrong. Most comments were pretty well intentioned (from his friends and family), but I actually find these almost harder to respond to than the blatantly rude ones because it's hard to strike a balance between polite but still letting them know it's inappropriate. I went with what a lot of people suggested and just turned it back around (when someone said 'how'd you snag this one?' I jumped in with 'I was just lucky, I guess'). As people were drinking there was one or two slightly more rude comments. One guy said (jokingly, but still) 'damn, what're you doing with this guy!' so I pulled my bf into me and said gave a sly wink and said 'oooo, that's between me and him' which everyone laughed at. 

Anyway, we ended up having a big discussion about it. He said he's getting used to it and trying not to let it really bother him so much, and that I shouldn't be offended or upset on his behalf. Pretty sure this is the man I want to marry so we're just going to have to find a way to get overcome it. Was good to hear in some of your comments that it just becomes a non-issue after a while.

TIFU by not washing anything I own for over a year,"So this was an ongoing fuck up that occurred over the past year and a half.  We ran out of laundry detergent and my wife and I separately stopped at the store (we both didn't know the other was stopping) and bought some. (Edit: we both bought the same thing) 

So that's the laundry detergent I've been using to wash everything for nearly a year and a half. Clothing, towels, sheets etc. all of it. I basically grabbed each bottle of detergent in turn so they both lasted forever 

Finally both bottles hit empty about a week ago and I dragged my ass to the store because I needed clean towel. I head to the detergent section and grab the same bottle I've been using for a year an a half (free and gentle. I don't like scented stuff) 

That's when I freeze. Because the bottle I'm holding, the same type of bottle I've been using for a year and a half... well I didn't grab it from the detergent section and it didn't say detergent on it.   

No that bottle said fabric softener. Not laundry detergent. No soap or cleaning agent that I'm aware of. None.   For a YEAR AND A HALF I've been softening the hell out of my clothing but not actually using detergent. 

I didn't want to believe it.   Ran back to the laundry room at my apartment where the trash hasn't been emptied and check the old bottle.   Fabric softener. 

I'm in shock. My wife has been complaining about the towels smelling for months and I thought it was in her head (I have a terrible sense of smell anyway but I knew I was washing the towels regularly) turns out I haven't washed those towels with detergent since we bought them.    She wondered why her whites always seemed dingy even when freshly washed.   Well now we know.   Because FABRIC SOFTENER... 

So now I've been washing everything I own and holy shit what a difference it makes when you actually use detergent. 



TL:DR I used fabric softener instead of laundry detergent for a year and a half, now I feel dirty and have to wash everything in my closet 


Edit: a proper TL:DR


Edit:   A lot of you are overusing detergent.  Check the cap. The fill line for a load is usually a half inch or less above the bottom of the cap, not the top. (I see the irony of me saying this but read the label. It's pretty clear how little you actually need) 

Edit3: for fucks sake people, stop telling me to not use fabric softener on towels. I DIDNT THINK I WAS!",tifu

TIFU by swiping on my girlfriend's phone NSFW,"So this happened a few days ago and I'm still not sure I'm 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

I've been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She's perfect for me. We're perfect for eachother. We're getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

We went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

She went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I'm talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you're back at the start of the photo album. It's annoying as hell.

But some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn't be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

There she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I've ever seen in my life. I've watched porn - a lot. I've never seen a dick like this. I'm talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

I could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

I closed the pictures and I've acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I've never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I'm significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

We haven't had sex since. I can't concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.

LPT: Bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike,"**TL;DR: Short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. Make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**

Short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.

The recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the Hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.

She survived, but she easily could have died. *On a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*

I myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. The only time I've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. I got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. It really can happen to just about anyone. I got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.

And now, with the popularity of parks exploding, I see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. Thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. If anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

So: never go unprepared. Get a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). Just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.

The things I have in mine include:

\- Survival heating blanket

\- Plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- Whistle

\- Flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- Lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- Critical meds and bandages

\- Zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- Flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- Compass (if you're able to use it)

\- Paracord

\- Knife

\- Duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- Hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (I always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing I can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - I've experienced this first-hand).

\- Iodine tabs for water

\- Beef jerky

\- Energy gel

**Edit:** Because it may be of interest: I just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that I don't mention in the list. For reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.

**Edit 2:** I wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. The kit I describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. 

The kit I mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.

For people wanting to see the kit I made, or skeptical it can be done - just google Nalgene survival kit. Lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than I have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. 

Definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.

Finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *This kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*",LifeProTips

TIFU by looking up my school bully,"So a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when I was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. I struggled like hell because I didn't speak a single word of English. The school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while I was there). Anyway, I tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. One guy just completely hated my guts from day one. No idea why or what I did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. So that's he kind of person I'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my English in class, in front of the teachers and all. There was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while I was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. I naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. When to leave school and which exist to use. Where to sit in class etc. Once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. Literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. I just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  The only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. I would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. Karma has to work right? The world can't be that unfair. 

Fast forward 15 years. I haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. I didn't make any friends and I didn't develop Stockholm's. I looked him up on Facebook. 

He owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. He lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. He is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. This has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and I just can't get over the bullshit I was fed, karma will get him for you. I think karma missed.

TIFU by immaculate ejaculation,"So this happened a month ago and it's one of the most embarrassing dating stories I have and it still haunts me and may haunt me forever.

&#x200B;

Alright so first date with a girl off a dating app we're vibing pretty hard and there's some sexual flirtation and environmental foreshadowing (2 slugs at the table we were drinking at were humping) so I try to figure out delicately with words if we gonna bonk and she blushes and says 'next time' then gives me an irresistible look that confirms she isn't kidding about next time. Butttt I'm in her town and the last train home for me is about 11pm. I suggest I leave to walk back to the train stations around 10:30, she convinces me to stay a bit longer and that she'll call me one of the local taxis to get me back to the station. Alright every single taxi company she calls has no free cars and I realise I'm stuck 30 miles from home at midnight with a girl I just met who is profusely apologising and blaming herself. My horny immoral mind realises I can salvage something. I say I'll just get a hotel but on the way there she keeps apologising and ends up inviting me back to her place to make up for it.

I'm very aware she probably didn't want to have sex considering she said ""next time."" As we're standing in her room awkwardly avoiding the fact it was time to get into bed I'm forced to ask the awkward question - ""so do you sleep with all your clothes on or? i normally sleep in my underwear."" She told me to go ahead so I undressed and got into her bed before she got in - fully clothed. We cuddle for a bit then share a glance and my temptations begin to kick in. I thanked her for letting me stay even though it wasn't her original plan, but told her that I really wanted to kiss her. The kiss became making out, and she was VERY intense and touchy and I honestly couldn't tell what she wanted. It was driving me crazy so I thought I might as well try my chances, moved my hand slowly down her waist and of course she stopped me. ""Not tonight."" She was an amazing kisser and I couldn't stop thinking about it all night.

So I lay there pressed up against her cuddling for 7 hours, unable to sleep the whole time, boner poking out of my underwear trying my hardest to make sure she doesn't notice. I am 100% sure I have never been hornier in my life. I was erect for at least 80% of the 7 hours and my balls started to viscously ache by hour 3. I feel like it's immoral to even say this but every time she readjusted her sleeping position and slightly brushed my crotch it was the sweetest torture. We were only spooning but her fully clothed body felt so good, every time I started falling asleep I realised my hands were wondering places they shouldn't, so I stopped trying to fall asleep altogether.

Around 7am I can tell she's starting to wake up because she's moving her hands around my back etc. She opens her eyes and looks at me with a seductive smile that once again made me wonder what the fuck is going through her head. The body touching slowly gets more intense and I realised I had a genuine problem - it feels like I'm actually getting sexual pleasure from simple caressing. I've never had a problem with premature ejaculation but spending hours upon hours sharing a bed with a girl I just met, hornier than I'd ever been had made me hypersensitive. The problem is confirmed when her hand explores new territory and brushes the skin just below my belly button and I literally have to recoil backwards. ""What's wrong?"" she asks me. I decide to just come out and nervously say ""I've been laying here awake horny as fuck for 7 hours. And NOW you're all handsy."" She said she was horny too and wanted it but has a first date rule. I was about to say that's classy and respectable or something when she leans in and starts making out with me and grinding. The way she kissed I started to lose it and I realised there was no way I could have sex with her because I wouldn't last very long.

That was an understatement. She started to lift up my underwear strap with her fingers, about to delve deeper when it happened. Nothing was currently touching my penis at the time. I ejaculated from being touched a few inches below my belly button. Like really hard too. I couldn't hide it as I twitched about everywhere. She was obviously pretty surprised.

She seemed understanding and seemed heartfelt when she said she had a good time and wanted to see me again - but well she stopped replying and I guess I know why.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Lay in bed with girl on first date horny as fuck and unable to sleep for 7 hours then when she changed her mind in the morning and got touchy I nut with no direct stimulation. This is one of the most embarrassing stories in my life and the fact it ruined what was a really nice date with a nice girl still fucks me up.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Alright I don't know whether I like the fact that this post blew up but I kind of half knew as I shamefully walked out of her house that this would make a strong TIFU post and I guess I was right. I messaged her today asking her to be honest if she stopped responding because of the morning thing. She said it was because I didn't message her for a week then asked her if she wanted to come over. I messaged her the same day a few hours after I left thanking her for a nice time and that I was hoping to see her again. I figured if she wanted to talk she would start a convo and my approach to dating is don't be the person who always starts convos - and the fact she didn't start one gave me the idea that she wasn't much of a texter which is cool. Apparently I was supposed to text her throughout the week. No way I could have known that and I don't see why it's on me to do that. She said the fact I asked her to come over offended her and that I thought she was easy. So yeah not my kinda girl anyway if she has those kinds of insecurities about sex and presumes that I know she wants to be texted a lot.",tifu

AITA for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?,"So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn't lift a finger to go visit her. 

I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he'd have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. 

He said no, he didn't want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

Last week, he told us she's dumped him. I went on her fb page as we're all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she's upset it didn't work out but these things happen, so we're on good terms) and looks like she's with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

Wife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible.

The husband leans over and asks his wife," 

""Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you.""

Yes, she says, ""I remember it well.""

OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggles to their feet and put their clothes back on.

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

I [32F] just dropped out of my sisters[30F] wedding as her MOH after a blowout fight because her fiancé[40M] called me cheap,"Long story short they got engaged in March. He comes from a large traditional European household where money is a big thing for their wedding events. Throughout all of there wedding things I've been there for my sister every step of the way, helping in any way I can. I've spent well over a grand just being present in her wedding party trying to keep up. Both of them have good paying jobs and his family comes from a very well off household. I have one part time job and my parents aren't exactly considered ""well off.""

Obviously my contributions are no where near what his family is used to but I thought giving what I could and putting in extra leg work would be enough maybe? 

Anyways, for her shower I spent around 200$ and made her a 7ft x 6ft backdrop as a gift because it's something that she really wanted. It took over three months to make it by hand. The other girls in her wedding party are all from his side of the family and are what I could only describe as prissy rich girls. Every time I try and make a suggestion that's cheaper for an event or something contributing to their wedding I get snubbed or ignored. No other bridesmaids have even lifted a finger to help my sister other than make bougie ass opinions on what she should do or be(which is not her). I've felt pretty left out in this whole process but didn't want to say anything because although I don't agree with how things are going, I want them to be happy because I love them. 

So today I went to my sister and her fiancés house for coffee. And her fiancé made a snarky comment about how I didn't give them an envelope of money at her shower. I said my gift was their backdrop and I thought that was okay. I reminded him that I'm only working about 20 hours a week right now and I can barely afford to pay my bills(I got laid off in January from my second job I had). He then preceded to say that his dad keeps a chart of how much everyone contributes to them and they had to lie otherwise he would of gotten pissed. I thought this was absolutely atrocious. I told him that weddings aren't about money. They are about love and family. And I've even known people that have gotten married and accepted zero gifts and just wanted to be surrounded by the people they cared about to celebrate their love. 

We went back and fourth for a few until I felt so overwhelmed I left and said I don't want to be a part of this anymore. I electronically transferred my sister money from my credit card and now I can't pay my gas bill and told her I don't want to talk anymore. Maybe I overreacted but I was really upset. She's texted me a few times and says she doesn't want my money but I can't even right now. She said that their traditions aren't like ours and I said I'm not the one getting married so sorry for offending anyone's traditions so take what I gave you and count me out of anything else. 

I feel terrible. His family has completely taken over their entire wedding and has completely omitted our traditions as it is and now I'm expected to pay hundreds of dollars more than a thousand I've already spent for something I don't even want to be a part of anymore. I love my sister but she hasn't once stood up for me or our family(and our traditions) and I'm seeing her change right in front of me and it makes me so upset. 

I don't know what to do now or where to go from here. She's my only sister and I'm sure this will be her only wedding and I feel like I've just ruined everything. 

TL;DR I'm going broke being apart of my sisters wedding. Her fiancé called me cheap, we all got into it and I stormed out crying because I don't feel good enough. Having regrets now. Help.

***************************************

**EDIT:** For all that were asking, his family is Serbian. And traditionally in his family they go to a lot of weddings and other events in their lifetime(seems like they have something going on almost every weekend for someone or something). His dad keeps a chart to keep track of how much money is given out so he can balance what they get in return. And **NO**, I do not agree with this. 

**EDIT 2:** My sister showed up at my house last night and apologized. She returned the money I transferred her and spoke with her fiancé. She said she wouldn't tolerate anything like this between our families. She let me know after speaking with her future husband that it's okay and will be okay if I can only give so much for the remaining duration of the wedding as she knows it's been a rough go for me this past year financially. She said he felt bad as we've all known each other for over 8 years and he wants to talk as he just reacted under the stress of his parents. I told her I needed some time away but I will still be her MOH. She said she understood why I was so upset and she will do her best to stand up for our family in the future. She admitted to getting lost in everything going on and was only trying to keep everyone happy.

TIFU by cleaning my ass with a comb.,"This happened all of 45 minutes ago, and yes, it still hurts a bit.

To start, some context. I always take incredibly long showers due to me getting sidetracked by random things, such as spinning in circles in order to get an even distribution of hot water, trying to scratch that damn itch, and the fascination that is my penis.

Another thing to note is that I always take a comb with me to the shower as I find it helps ""rub in"" the shampoo, except this time, there was a new [comb](https://i.imgur.com/MdY4S21.jpg) that I hadn't seen before. 

Now that that is out of the way, let's get into the Fuck-Up. My shower started off as usual, rubbing a bar of soap absolutely everywhere while trying to use my fingernails to carve designs into the bar. After about five or so minutes of soaping, I moved to the hair process, which also went as planned. This is where I dun goofed. Upon seeing this new comb, I decided to use it, as it had finer teeth. After using said comb, I realised that it also had a ^^much sharper/thinner handle. 

>The following actions have been made by a fucking idiot, and is NSFW. Proceed with caution.

When I saw the handle, for some unknown reason, I built the thought process of ""This handle is so thin, I bed I'd be able to stick it up my ass and not feel it."" Was it sensible? No. Was there reasoning behind it? Nada. Was it a good idea? Absolutely not.

That thought was immediately followed up with ""Why the hell not,"" which was then followed by a comb, of which I had never seen before, going into my ass. Now obviously, with nothing ever being in my ass before, there was a small brown patch on the end of the handle upon removal, and for some reason, I got the god awful idea that I should clean the inside of my ass. How, you ask? Stab the handle into a bar of fucking soap, of course. 

With the handle now soapy, I returned to my ass and was immediatly greeted with a slight stinging feeling. ""Whatever, thats probably the soap cleaning away and is bound to only be temporary,"" I thought. I. Was. Wrong. The stinging only got worse once I pulled the comb out. I then spent the rest of my shower rubbing my ass in hopes to get rid of the feeling.

Fast forward to nearly an hour later and I am still feeling the consequenses of putting a hair product in my arse.

Over all, 1/10, would not penetrate again.

>TLDR: I stuck a soapy comb handle up my ass in hopes to clean it. Not a good idea.

>Edit: Too many people are reading about me using a comb to sodomize myself, go away!!

>Edit #2: My ass feels fine now. I've eaten a massive cheeseburger, however, so the visit to the bathroom later should be interesting.

>Edit #3: A lot of you seem to be concerned as to where the comb came from/whos it is, which is so be expected since I forgot to specify that I had bought it a few months ago and only today found it again. No, thankfully, it was no one else's hair product that became my booty stabber. 

>Edit #4: #Alright, who did it? Who guilded the booty stabber?

>Edit #5: It was the soap causing the pain (the pain lasted less than 90 minutes), not the comb. The *buttfuck retarded comb abuser lives to shit another day!

>**Also, the comb was mine, don't worry. I had bought it a few months ago because of the finer teeth and had forgotten about it until now.

>Edit #6: Yes, I have ADHD, and yes, it is treated. I am a happy, yet easily distracted curious Charlie!",tifu

I went to her told her she looks beautiful and that I like her small boobs. I then told her about the medical side effects, and told her I did not want her to do it. But then told her I would support her decision and would love her even if she had them, and would stand by her. We did some research. She then came back to me an hour later and told me she did not want to get them. She then hugged me and started crying. She told me her friend kept making fun of her for it. She said that she had been bullied about it since she was 16. She then told me she though I was lying about me saying I thought her smaller boobs were hot. She kinda just stood and cried for like 10 minutes. So I guess that ended okay with her letting it out...

[WI] My employer wants me to wear a wig,"Can my employer require me to wear a wig?

I'm a woman with thinning hair. HR says my hair is ""unprofessional"", and wearing a hat or head cover was also rejected (""It's not normal to wear headwear indoors""). I work a desk job in an office environment and direct customer interaction is very rare. I have a number of bald/thinning male co-workers.

Is this gender discrimination? It seems that gender-based hair requirements are legal, so maybe not.

My thinning hair started during pregnancy, but I'm not currently pregnant. I don't have any other medical issues.

Wigs are expensive and uncomfortable, and my employer is not willing to reimburse me for the cost of a wig. They are expecting me to purchase a wig that is comparable in appearance to natural hair ($$$).

Why did my mom start laughing hysterically before she died?,"My mom just recently died of lung cancer. A couple hours after the ambulance brought her home for hospice, she was sleeping, when she tried to hop out of bed and sit in a chair. Then she tried to take all her clothes off. Which, I've read is all normal for end stages of life.

But what really got me was that when we got her back into bed, she just started laughing hysterically for like 5 minutes straight and then basically became unresponsive after that.

It was pretty disturbing. Probably more disturbing than when she evacuated her bowels, even, because at least I was told that would happen. I just can't get that broken laugh out of my head. I was wondering if that might be a symptom of hypoxia or something or if that's also a normal thing to happen at the end of one's life. I couldn't really find anything about it on the internet. And if I'm going to have flashbacks about it, I just kind of want an explanation or to know if anyone has experienced the same.

Edit: Thank you, everyone, for your explanations and your kindness. Fortunately, my original doctor and therapist from when I was in high school (when my mom first got sick) are in my insurance network again. They got me in right away, even though mental assessment appointments are usually a month out. And, they're friends, so they talk to each other often about my treatment plan. I've basically got the mental healthcare provider dream team. I've also started a meditation practice and walk more often.

I have been neglecting my OCD, depression, and anxiety for years, but no more. I have a life to live. I feel like it would be spitting on my mom's existence (and her nine year battle) to let my mental illness continue keeping me from being joyful and reaching goals. I have to be strong enough to carry this torch.",NoStupidQuestions

TIFU when I saw my friends sister,"This literally just happened. I was walking to the spot I normally stand at on the train platform but I didn't have my contacts in so my vision/depth perception wasn't very good. I hear someone say hi so I turn to look as I'm walking and I see my friends sister with her arms outstretched. In my head I'm like oh alright she wants a hug, so I go in and give her a hug. I thought it felt kind of strange, like she wasn't really hugging back so I end the hug and back up to look at her. At this point I realize a) that it wasn't my friends sister but a random woman waiting for the train and b) she was extending her arms to someone who was behind me, who I noticed after the hug. They both looked pretty horrified so I didn't even really try to explain myself, I kind of just walked away without saying anything. 

TL;DR: went in for a hug, ruined someone's morning",tifu

TIFU by showing my mom her dad's death certificate from +30 years ago.,"So I know that sounds kinda bad, but let me explain.

So yesterday my mom took my grandma to go get a bank account and a debit card. My family and I came from Chile and my grandma is 71 so it was kind of a big deal to her. So big in fact that she decided to put some of the bank documents in her ""important papers box."" When she saw me, she was so excited she just had to show me. At first I was like ""Oh Lala (what we call her) that's pretty cool!"" and then I noticed this old-looking paper book looking thing. I asked her what it was. She grabbed it out of the book and told me it was the equivalent of a marriage certificate in Chile that had her and my grandpa's marriage certified and any children born in that marriage as well. As she was flipping through it showing me the contents, there was a little yellow folded up sheet that kinda looked like my birth certificate, but it was yellow instead of aqua. So I asked her what it was and she unfolded it and told me it was my grandpa's death certificate. It had his date of death and location. 

You see, I was born in 1994 and he died in 1985 and there aren't that many photos of him so I barely know the man. He's always just been a dead relative to me. I asked my grandma if she could leave that for me [when she passes in the future] and she told me that she would rather give it to me now so I can keep it. I was really happy because I like having that kind of stuff. When my family and I moved from Chile when I was 6, we practically left our whole history behind us and aside from what little information my dad has about his side, I barely know anything about my maternal grandpa. The only things that I know about him are that he used to be the equivalent of a governor in Chile, at some point probably murdered some guy, and that he left my grandma a drunk and died on the streets at some point. I don't really want to pry into the sensitive topics of my family history so that's all I picked up on over the years.

Anyway, I take the book and certificate and put them in my safe along with my own legal documents. Eventually my mom comes home and she comes to my room, where my wife and I are just relaxing, to talk about something or another. After she's done talking, I tell her ""Look what Lala gave me to keep"" because I was honestly excited. She looks at it and says ""What is it?"" And I open it up to show her her parent's marriage certificate, and then her and her sisters registered as their children. It didn't hit me there and then that this was the first time my mom had ever seen this, and as she's flipping through it she sees her dad's information and says ""So he was born on March 15th…""

At that point I realized that my mom might've not know her dad as much as I thought. She'd tell me stories from before he left how he'd take her to all these government buildings and get her nice dresses and stuff so I made assumptions like anyone else would. She seemed kinda mesmerized by it and then I told her ""Here, take a look at this."" and handed her the death certificate. She looked at it and just kinda stared at it. Then she started crying, not sobbing, but just tearing up and crying looking at the piece of paper in her hands.

Then I put two and two together and came to the realization that she never knew exactly when her dad died. Just that one day he left, and then one day she was told that he was found dead on the side of a street after another night of drinking in a completely different city. But this certificate…it was real. It was accurate down from a year but to a day of a month to the hour and the minute when he was declared dead.

I felt horrible and immediately went and hugged my mom and tried to console her. He died over 30 years ago but I felt like I had been the person that told her that her dad was dead. 

Some say that ignorance is bliss or that closure brings peace to people, but all I know was that in that moment I was the one making my mom cry.

Eventually my mom left the room and silently went to bed. My wife, who had watched the whole encounter in silence, didn't say anything but I felt terrible nonetheless.

Edit for new: Tl;dr: Showed my my her dad's death certificate that she had never seen before that also had his date of death that she also didn't know.",tifu
AITA for getting a single mother fired even though she was nice to me?,"For context, I am really into body building and have been going to the gym 3-4 times a week since I was 13 (now 29).

There is a personal trainer, Ashley, at my current gym thats also a single mother of two. I mention this as it's the reason I think I'm probably an asshole since she clearly needs the job to support her kids.

Anyway, I'm not really friends with her, but she's always really nice to me and has flirted with me a lot previously. We talk occasionally. Yesterday she asked if I wanted to add her on social media and I figured why not, so I said yes.

Later in my workout I started looking through her posts out of boredom when I saw a picture of a morbidly obese person along with a caption making fun of them trying to run. The picture was clearly taken at the gym.

This really angered me because they're trying to improve their health, and the last thing they need is some attractive young girl talking shit about them, even if it's not to their face. I scrolled through a few more posts and sure enough this is a regular thing. She discreetly takes pictures of fat people to make fun of when they're working out.

Really really pissed me off to see these people being made fun of for trying to fix their life. Without thinking I just went straight to the owners office (we know each other well) to show him. Ashley was fried immediately.

When I told my GF she said I'd let my anger get the best of me because now her kids will suffer if she can't find another good job. So now I feel kinda shit about doing that, AITA?",AmItheAsshole
Husband [24M] threw away my [22F] new anti-depressants.,"I have been married to my husband for 1 year. We have a 2 month old daughter.

I feel like I've always been somewhat ""depressed""(/low energy) since adolescence. Ive never been the type of person to be overly excited or motivated by life. I suffered from anorexia when I was in university, and although that's recovered, the feelings of low self worth are still there.

My husband is a stoic, ""no-nonsense"" kind of person. He is not very emotional, but loving in his own way. He is a trustworthy, hardworking, and responsible man.

After I gave birth to my daughter, I had mild postpartum depression.I went to see a therapist but did not take antidepressants since I was breastfeeding. Now, I've decided to formula feed my daughter. I have just been prescribed an antidepressant to take daily. It is supposed to have little/mild side effects.

I took only one dose until my husband saw the drugs and asked me what they were. I told him they were my antidepressants. He said, ""You dont need them. You're fine."" Then said that they have a lot of bad side effects and I'll end up hating my life if I took them. I told him I just wanted to give them a try.

The thing is, I felt very clearheaded after taking just one dose. Maybe it was a placebo effect but I did feel different.

When I came home from work, my pill case was empty. My husband said he had thrown everything away, including my sleep meds, because he said it was better for my health. He also said that he doesn't want his wife to be ""high"" all the time. Which is hypocritical because he smokes weed a lot. 

I was so angry. I can't afford to just get another prescription. How will I tell my therapist? My husband told me to calm down and said it was all for my benefit.
I told him hes not my doctor. He said he knew me better than the doctor did, and he knows Im fine and I dont need any drugs.

What can I do at this point?

TL;DR: Husband threw away my meds because he doesn't think I need them.",relationship_advice

Little Bobby was running through the woods,"Little Bobby was running through the woods behind his house when the urge to go #2 struck. Bobby did his business behind a tree and carried on his way. The next day, Bobby was out behind his house again when he saw a swarm of flies circling yesterday's droppings. Intrigued, Bobby dropped his pants and did his business in the exact same spot in hopes of seeing how many flies he could gather. 

After a couple weeks of doing this, Bobby had created a rather tall pile of dung. So tall, in fact, that he now needed to use a step ladder to make sure he had a stable poo-pole developing. A curious neighbor caught sight of Bobby doing this, and after confronting Bobby, the neighbor punched Bobby in the face and told him to grow the hell up. 

Over the next few days, word of Bobby's droppings had spread around town. It started with just a few people a day coming up to Bobby, punching him in the face, and telling him the errs of his way. It wasn't long until there was a line of over 50 people waiting to see Bobby's poo-pole and to subsequently punch him in the face. The line moved pretty slowly, however, and someone towards the back of the line had to take care of some business of his own. Not wanting to leave his spot, he dropped his pants answered nature's call right then and there. 

The stench of his droppings spread quickly throughout the line. One gentleman towards the front of the line caught its stench when he saw Bobby's creation, admiration spreading across his face. The man at the front of the line turned around and said ""that was a good shit post, but this punchline stinks.""",Jokes

"If your girlfriend is bi, being intimate with other girls should be considered cheating","Saw a thread where the OP was getting territorial over his bi girlfriend cuddling and sleeping over with other girls. All the comments basically said ""get over it""

I said ""It should be considered equivalent to her cuddling and sleeping over with a guy, because she's attracted to both genders. talk with her and if she continues break things off""

BLASTED with downvotes, called a bigot and biphobic. 

I mentioned a situation where I was in a relationship with a bi girl and she made out with other girls when we were together. When I had a problem with it, she replaced me with another guy who'd be okay with watching her playing tonsil hockey with other girls. 

Replies just said things like ""good, I hope you go through situatuons like that for the rest of your life""

So... cheating is only okay if it's girl-on-girl? What kind of logic is this? If Im straight, date someone that's bi, I'm supposed to let her make out with other girls? If I'm bi, does that mean I get a free pass to make out with other dudes, and if my gf gets mad she gets called a bigot?

EDIT: Some comments have me confused. Being bi is perfectly fine. Having a relationship being bi is fine. I know a lot of bi people who don't cheat, and are happy. As long as you set your own boundaries that both of you consent to, even if you two agree you can make out with others.

All this post is about is the morons on reddit who think girl-on-girl or boy-on-boy actions are exclusively not cheating. Its not a dig at any bi relationships, its a dig at the ""if shes/hes doing it with a girl/boy its not cheating"" mindset. Again, if you guys agreed that's acceptable behavior thats okay.

"AITA for letting a girl believe regular brownies were ""weed brownies"" and letting her make a fool of herself all night in front of our friends?","So there's this girl in my friend group. She has a tendency to be kind of over the top and stretches the truth a lot. We all were hanging out over the weekend to celebrate another friend's birthday. Apparently a few people had the idea to give her ""pot brownies"" and see how she'd react. The catch is that they had nothing in them at all. But they were banking on her acting high anyway to fit in with everyone else. 

I didn't find out about this whole plan until I got there. Everyone else pretended to be high and so did the girl, predictably. I didn't participate in that part but I also didn't tell her it was all a huge joke at her expense. 

At the end of the night someone told her and called her out on always being fake. She got really upset and ended up leaving the party early by herself. I do feel bad for her but I also feel like she kind of brings this on herself sometimes because she's always trying too hard. 

Again though, this wasn't my prank and I probably wouldn't have planned something like this myself. But it is what it is now.

TIFU by ignoring the no fraternizing at work rule and had a SWAT team called on me.,"This is a long story with a lot of details. So strap in, there's a nice payoff at the end. 

Like most TIFU, I was younger at the time, about 19 years old and was working at an Italian restaurant in the town that I live in. I live in a decently sized beach town that has no little to no crime and feels very much like a small town. 

The bosses at the restaurant I worked at were only a few years older than me and had hired me basically because I made them laugh during the interview. I realized this was important on my first day, because basically every other employee at the restaurant were girls. Hot ones. Like it's hard to concentrate on what you were doing hot. Of course my bosses did this so that they could hook up with them after work. And it worked. I regularly witnessed this process. So it was never surprising when one wouldn't show up and they'd hire another hot one sometime thereafter. I actually became numb to it. Instead of trying to act cool when a hot girl showed up for her first day, I was actually just cool about it. Because I was never the one getting laid. The bosses monopolized every chance that walked in through the front door. 

So when one day, a mid 30's supermodel faced Russian girl walked in the front door dressed like me, I didn't even flinch. She was without a doubt, the new hottest girl at the restaurant. But I was polite and said hi a couple times to her, but ultimately ignored her the first few weeks she worked with me. Mind you, the restaurant was always super busy and I knew that all these girls ended up hooking up with my wealthy, good looking bosses. I knew my chances were slim to none. Why bother even trying? 

After a few weeks of basically ignoring this girl, I realize that every day we work together, she basically starts to follow me around. If I'm at the bar, she's at the bar. If I'm at a break out back, she's on her break too. We start talking, and she's funny and I like listening to her. So eventually I start giving her rides home from work and picking her up when she needs it. And thus begins the framework for the most insane hookup night of my life. 

See, this girl didn't own her own car, but lived in a nice house with a roommate in a nice neighborhood. The same neighborhood as my wealthy bosses. My bosses actually had to pass her house on their way home from work. The neighborhood was within walking distance of work, which is why she started working there. So we start getting closer, but like the idiot that I am, I never even begin to think there is potential that I could hook up with her. I'm sure I am completely in the friend zone. And I didn't care. She's pretty and she's hanging around with me and I'm 19. She's 30 something. I feel special enough. 

I also don't think much of it either when I show up to work and start getting ribbed by one of my bosses about hanging out with her. He teased me in a fun way and I deny there being anything between us because there wasn't. But after a few days of this, I noticed the boss who primarily hooks up with the girls watching me a lot and not being so nice to me anymore. I'm young, but I immediately understand the problem I'm creating. He hires hot girls and then fucks them. That's the routine. I'm fucking up his routine. Hottest girl in the restaurant is hanging around me and not him. Being that I like my job, and make way more money than a 19 year old should, I really start pushing away from hot Russian girl. To the point of ignoring her. This was when I learned an early lesson about really hot girls. One you've probably heard before. Their entire adult life is riddled with guys who chase them, constantly pester them and never leave them alone. For a guy, any guy, to completely ignore them, is foreign to them. Paying them no attention will a lot of time actually make them go after you harder. Which is exactly what happened. 

So now it's becoming noticeable to me and everyone else we work with that this girl won't leave me alone. She begins to hang on me and tease me and do anything that will have me paying attention to her. On one side of the coin, it was awesome. On the other side, I could see my one bosses boiling rage that the younger funny guy he hired was beating him in the hot Russian girl game. And I wasn't just beating him, I was sweeping the series. Without so much as trying. 

So one weekend night I show up for work and as soon as I get inside, the boss who has begun to hate me calls me into the office. By the way, let's call hot, supermodel Russian girl ""Anna"". 

Boss: ""What's going on with Anna?""
Me: ""I don't know, did she not show up?""
Boss: ""No, I mean with you and her. You guys fucking?""

So I'm young and smart, and know when I shouldn't let people walk over me or intimidate me. I want to keep my job, but I won't be a bitch about things either. So smiling I say, ""I'm not sure if that's any of your business.""

Big mistake. The mistake that starts it all. Because he slams the paper's he working on down hard on the table. He turns around in his chair and says, ""Do you like your job? Do you want to keep it?"" He knows the answer, so I just stare at him. ""Well then stop seeing Anna. Stop picking her up, stop hanging with her every second that you are here. Stop allowing her to hang on you. Or I'll fire you."" Immediately I understand the depth of how much he is into this girl and he's willing to fire me over it to get his way. And so I agree. I make the decision right then and there, that I'll keep away from her. Like I said, I have little to no chance anyway, and I'm making great money. Whatever. 

The night begins to wind down and I decide to go take a break out back. I've been ignoring Anna all night and my boss is now thoroughly pleased with me. His master scheme has worked and he can get back to trying to fuck the hottest waitress in the restaurant. So I'm sitting out back, not even thinking about the situation when Anna busts out the back door and slams it shut behind her. She's evidently pissed. She walks right up to me and doesn't fuck around with what's on her mind. 

Anna: ""Are you mad at me?""

Me: ""No, look Anna, I like you. You're great. But us being friends is making shit uncomfortable with the bosses and I. They're getting pissed at me.""

Anna: ""Because (shitty boss) wants to fuck me?""

Me: Yes, because (shitty boss) wants to fuck you.""

Anna: ""Do you want to fuck me?""

This is the part in the movie where the record would scratch, and then the main character laughs uncomfortably, completely at a loss for words. 

Me: ""Um, uh... look, you're beautiful. No guy who sees you isn't attracted to you.""

Anna: ""I asked if you wanted to fuck me?""

Me: ""Yeah. I would fuck you."" 

Anna: ""Good, then when we got off work tonight, take me back to my place and fuck me."" 

And with that she walks off and back into the restaurant. I sit there stunned, in a haze. I'm pretty sure she's serious. I'm terrified. My life up until this point has been awful drunken hookups with high school girls at parties. I literally can't think. But I'm in. I'm solidly fucking in. Fuck my boss. This is worth losing my job over. 

So we wrap up work and she jumps in my car and we speed off. It's only when I pull up to her house, do I remember, shit... my boss lives in this neighborhood. I'm pretty sure he has to pass right down this road when he goes home. This must be how he has figured out she and I had been hanging out so much. I can't leave my car in the driveway. He'll see it. So she comes up with an idea I can't disagree with. There's a doctors office in a business complex right across the street. I can park there and just run back over. It's perfect. 

So I get back to her house, and walk in her front door and walk to her room, and she's standing in her underwear. It goes without saying that it's a memory burned into my mind. She takes my hand, sits me down on her bed and what follows is exactly what a 19 year old kid dreams of. So it's about 30 minutes later and the room is darkly lit and I'm praying to every major deity and thanking them that I haven't finished too quickly, because I want this moment to last forever. She's on top of me, and time is in slow motion. It's the greatest moment of my life at that point. Which is why it took me a few seconds to realize I'm seeing flashlights on her ceiling. I'm also seeing flashlights underneath her door to her room. She notices them first. Then I'm snapped back to reality. She starts to freak out. It's obviously flashlights. Pouring into her house. 

Being that I was the guy, and the guy is always supposed to protect the girl, I run naked to one of the windows. I look outside to see (and I'm not exaggerating here) 10 to 12 police cars with their lights on. In my peripheral I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. Slowly approaching is 5 officers dressed completely in SWAT gear. My only rational thought is that I'm watching all this and I'm naked. I no longer have an erection. I grab my boxers, throw them on and go to run back to the window. They're at this house, but this can't be for us. I'm confused. 

From outside, a man yells, ""(Town I live in) Police! Open the front door immediately! The house is surrounded! We have a K-9 Unit! We will send him in if you don't comply!"" I don't even think. I'm not a guy who gets in trouble a lot and have police officers in my family. The police tells you to do something, you do it. End of discussion. So I run to the front door, I swing it open and am staring at about 20 officers. SWAT included. Now my erection is inside me. I put my hands up, and go to speak when a hand comes out of nowhere and whips me to the ground. In my underwear. And it's raining. I land in a puddle. Hard. I hear hot Russian girl scream. The police rush past and enter the house. What the fuck is happening? I now have a vagina. 

I'm cuffed, there's dog's barking. A knee crushes into my neck and I'm throw into the back of a car while I'm asking what is happening. A few minutes pass and I turn to see hot Russian girl's roommate and hot Russian girl in my t-shirt and a towel talking to police. They're both cuffed. I'm sitting the back of the squad car for about a minute when I glance across the street and see 3 more police cars parked next to my Jeep. Where I had parked in the business complex. That perfect parking spot to hide from my boss. Then it dawns on me. It wasn't a perfect spot. Because it was well passed midnight. We work at a restaurant that doesn't get out till late. So I parked my car in an empty business parking lot, late at night, got out and ran around the side of the building. Mind you, I'm dressed in black from my job. Late at night, dressed in black, running around the side of a closed building. That probably looked pretty suspicious to the elderly security guard who patrolled the complex at night. 

So he made a call to the sheriff. So I know you're thinking at this point, well there's no way this many officers, let alone SWAT would show up for this. But they did. And here's why. The security guard went to the building to play police officer while waiting for the cops to arrive. He got out his flashlight and went searching apparently from building to building looking into windows. He at one point climbed up on a bench and looked inside a window and slipped and his flashlight crashed into and through a window. So now the alarms have gone off. When the police finally show up, he completely neglects to mention, he's the one who set off the alarm. Being that he's old, I've kind of forgiven him since then. So when the cops go searching the buildings they not only find a broken window, but know someone has attempted to get inside. Obviously. But they can't find me. Because I'm across the street having the greatest night of my life. So they call the K-9 Unit for a search. Which just so happens to be doing a late night training operation with the local SWAT team. What better way to train, then to do a real world exercise with someone breaking and entering. 

But it gets better. Her roommate drove a really nice car. An older Mercedes. A Mercedes that had just recently been in a minor car accident the week before. Damage right to the driver side of her car. Not major, but a nice little dent. So when the K-9 sniffs and tracks me passed the building, right up to the house I'm in, (yeah the dogs noses are that good) they now see a car that looks like it has been kicked in and house with basically no lights on in it. They treat the situation as if I could be running and trying to get away from them. Which gets us back to where I'm at. Soaked, in my underwear, in the back of a squad car. 

Now I know this has been a long story, and if you've stuck with it, the payoff is coming right now. And it's an amazing payoff. 

When I'm pulled out of the car, I explain the same story to them that hot Russian girl has told them: my boss told me to stay away and so I parked my car across the street to get laid. Basically word for word. The look they all give each other was priceless. I'll cherish that look forever. But, they now realize they have fucked up majorly but don't want to admit it just yet. There's about 10 cops standing around me outside of the car. 

SWAT guy: ""How'd the window get broken?""

Me: ""I don't know, I didn't touch anything. I just ran around the side to her house.""

Officer: ""The security guard just told us he accidentally broke it, he didn't tell us that earlier.""

SWAT guy: ""So you're over here, kinda hooking up?""

Me: ""Yes sir. We work together. We just got off work. That's why I just parked there.""

SWAT guy #2: ""She's like in her 30's. You look about 16.""

Me: ""I'm 19. But yeah, she's older than me.""

SWAT guy: ""Wow."" 

A couple chuckles. Then silence. 

SWAT guy: ""Seriously... good for you man. I'm amazed. You're on another level then I was at your age."" 

They then begin to apologize and begin to say things like ""You understand we were just doing our jobs, we didn't know what was actually happening. You could have been dangerous"" etc. etc. 

So I tell them not to worry and that I have police family members and completely understand. I won't be suing them or filing reports or anything. I just want the cuffs off. So they continue to be extra nice as they turn me around to take my cuffs off. So the payoff I've been talking about... the amazing kicker to the whole story. When they turn me around, I'm now facing back out across the street, in my underwear with the cuffs still on, and I see both my bosses pulled over on the side of the road, sitting on the side of their car, watching the whole thing. How long they have been there, I don't know. There were so many cop cars in the street they had to stop and wait. 

I was fired coincidentally within a few weeks. ",tifu

[PA] Landlord from 6 years ago is telling me he forgot to cash my rental checks. Am I obligated to send him new ones?,"My landlord of six years ago sent me a letter with photocopies of old checks I had sent him. According to him, he forgot to cash said checks and is requesting new ones. There are several checks and the total amount is not insignificant.

I'm in a fairly tight spot myself at the moment handling a mortgage, house repairs, etc. I don't see how I could pay back the requested amount without causing undue stress on myself.

Can my former landlord pursue legal action against me? Is there some sort of statute of limitations on this?

Debt Collectors chasing me for friends debts,"My old best friend had a breakdown,  got together with a toxic partner and ended up addicted to drugs and accruing alot of debt 4 years ago. 

She has listed my address,  mobile number and home phone number as either her contact details or as me as a reference to her debt.  The calls started in 2015 and continued for around 6 months. She didn't have a mobile at that stage so I notified her via messenger and requested she resolve the issues.  This didn't work so I notified her parents and asked that they deal with it.  They gave me permission to pass their numbers onto the Collectors.  

Last month,  new collectors have started again I'm assuming with new debt.  I inform them the details she's supplied is incorrect,  I no longer have contact with her and to stop contacting me.  They've refused to remove my details from their files and continue to contact me - at this stage there is 4 different agencies chasing me for her.  

I'm concerned the implications this may have on my credit file in the future - moving isn't an option nor is changing my information.  

Is there any thing I can do legally to stop her doing this?

UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"Orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**TL;DR:** Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.

Update **TL;DR** at bottom

First I just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  I can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

I took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  I had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  It wasn't until I got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that I was able to try and move on.  My wife and I actually met in a soccer league we were in together. We've had so much trust for so long that I thought those fears had gone away.  It wasn't until now that I really started to feel shaken like that again.

But I didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  A few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

It's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. I didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  I got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. I couldn't wait any longer.  I made our favorite omelets, and told her I needed to talk about something.

""You know I'm not Ashley, right?""

She knows me well.  Ashley's my ex who cheated.

So first I apologized.  I apologized because I let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  What should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

We talked for a while.  I told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. I told her how much I loved the relationship that we've built together, and I felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  She had never given me a reason not to trust her and that I still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  She thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  She volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

But something still felt off.  I honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  Normally she would have been upset that I didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling I couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

It seemed like she was saying all the right things, but I couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid.  Maybe there's a gut feeling that I need to listen to.  But I ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if I still needed the surgery.

Turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  I've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. So I brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. The urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that I wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. He mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

Being there didn't really help.  I feel like I just got more uncertainty.  

She had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  We talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. She seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. She promised to do it in the morning.  I asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

There's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  I really couldn't put my finger on it.  We were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and I couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had Sunday.

I've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but I haven't been able to focus.  We have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  This morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. We don't do that, she's never needed to before.  And I checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time Thursday that I mentioned I was busy working on-site. We were supposed to go together.

I'm starting to go crazy. How do I bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  I'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  But I need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if I'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**TL;DR Had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  Urologist said I had obstructive azoospermia, implied I should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think I could be fertile.  Wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when I can't go.  Getting a second Urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

UPDATE:  I've been trying to center myself.  We talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  She claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  I didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  I'm just trying to not overreact right now. I don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and Im a Father! Or...not.  Thankfully she's not working late today.  

Thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

UPDATE:  I went for a long run to clear my mind.  Gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  I'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why I've still been struggling personally with some of them.  Regardless of what happens I'm done with any confusion left between us.

  Thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

AITA for losing it at my granddad's funeral?,"My grandfather passed a month ago, shortly after my (21F) 21st birthday. My dad left when I was 7, and my mum passed away when I was 11, shortly after my grandma. My granddad took me in straight away despite his age, even though he was still mourning both his wife and daughter.

Though still deadly sharp, his physical condition wasn't great in his last few years. I'd express my worry for him sometimes, but he'd always tell me to get lost and assure me he'd ""see me through 'til 21."" He was the light of my life.

When he died, I didn't shed a tear. It's hard for me to explain why, but he was still giving sass on his deathbed, and pinched my arm and told me to not cry because he wasn't crying.

After I left, I received a text from my aunt later that evening that she was disappointed at me for not being visibly mournful and apparently him telling me not to was a very poor response. I ignore this, since we were all grieving.

I didn't return to the house for three days to avoid being alone again. When I did return, I found the shelves empty, bits of furniture missing, and photos taken from the walls. I confronted my aunt immediately, who after some arguing returned most of what was taken.

Maybe she didn't think I'd notice, but not only had she taken both my granddad's and his dad's service medals, she had sold them as well.

Luckily, I found the selling post on Facebook quickly enough and the man who bought them was happy to return them to me. I refunded man, and don't plan on asking my aunt for repayment since I'm just so glad to have them back in the first place. I did not confront my aunt about this.

The funeral arrives, and I'm straight away hounded for going through with a cremation. I keep telling her that it was my granddad's decision, not mine, but apparently this contradicted his Catholic values (???)

I'm an extremely mellow person, but this continued into the gathering afterwards. She told others how selfish I was for not letting her take any of his belongings, and how she thought I pushed him into signing his house over to me.

I was soon invited to sit among a table of some of his old friends, at which my aunt was sat too. I tried to not pay her any mind, but the conversation soon devolved and she slipped up and told the table that I hadn't even let her take a single medal.

I lost myself at this, and erupted into a slurry of profanities. My aunt immediately starts crying, and I seize moment to call her out on her selling the medals in the first place. 

I'm not sorry for the things I said to my aunt, but I'm deeply ashamed of my behaviour given the setting. Some people have approached me offering support, to which I have not replied, but I have this immense feeling of guilt in my stomach that I can't shake.

I know for sure that I overreacted, but AITA? Should I apologise to each attendee individually? I'm in a terrible way at the moment and my mind is all over the place. I feel like I need someone from the outside to tell me what to do.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for making Gargoyle noises while my overtly loud roommates have sex late into the night after repeatedly asking them to quiet down?,"So, I've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. But basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.

I've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.

Well, it didn't stop. 

Anyway, since I'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, I've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until I kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.

The noises are kind of, like, SKREEEEEEEOOOOOOOASH! SKREEEEASCCHHHHH! followed by snorts and the like.

So far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what I'm doing downstairs. I brush it off like it's no big deal and I really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. His audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor Gargoyle rears its ugly head.

AITA for making gargoyle noises to ruin my roommate's mood with his gf because he won't respect my wishes to not have audibly loud sex in the middle of the night on weekdays?

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/af5h58/tifu_by_finding_out_ive_been_accidentally_dating/

Same updated [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/am8cr1/23andme_has_just_shown_that_ive_been_accidentally/) on r/23andme.

First things first, just wow. I can't thank you all enough for the support through the kind comments and messages. I wish I could reply to all of them, but there are just too many. 

I'll answer some common questions I received towards the end of the post, but I'll first start with where we left off. 

After a long dreadful night full of surprises, I woke up the next morning questioning everything. I called bullshit on the test and immediately called Sarah. She picks up telling me she's already booked an appointment with a Genetic counselor. Good, we're both on the same page.  

The next day, we meet with the genetic counselor specifying in patients who take tests with commercial companies. TLDR of what she said was, while the Ancestry reports can be interpreted with a degree of skepticism, DNA matches are determined directly through the raw DNA data, meaning the connection is either there or it isn't. We asked if there was a possibility that we contaminated each other's samples. She said that our samples would have been flagged by the system (apparently that's easy to spot). Even if our 'contaminated' samples magically made it through the system, we would have been shown to be sharing completely identical segments, while 23andme showed we only share half identical segments. 

It was basically confirmed by a specialist at this point and the same feeling of dread I had the other night began to set in again. My friend called an hour later, telling Sarah and I to upload our raw data to a 3rd party dna site online, as extra confirmation. We did just that, and surprise surprise, we're shown as being half-siblings.

Sarah and I spent the rest of the day calling both of our parents and explaining everything. We all came to the conclusion of Sarah and I taking a weekend trip back home, to see how this all started. This idea came to me the same night when the whole ordeal began. 

Ever since that night, Sarah and I, understandably, haven't been the same. I've been trying to mentally cope with my emotions. The logic part of me is telling me ""Incest bad, not right, break up"" while emotionally, I still love Sarah. I'm having this constant battle in my head, and I'm sure Sarah is too. All of this was especially apparent when Friday rolled around. We both packed our bags and hopped into my car. During our ENTIRE drive up North towards home, not a single fucking word from the both of us. 5 hours later, we finally made it to Sarah's house (the agreed meeting destination). Right before we exit the car, my brain decides to short-circuit. I grab Sarah's hand and lean into kiss her. She stops me, looks me in the eyes, and after brief pause while teary-eyed says ""No matter what the outcome of all this will be, I'll be leaving having gained a brother."" That shit hit me HARD. We both hug each other and start crying. For the first time in nearly a week, I felt some kind of relief while simultaneously thinking ""WTF is going on"". Sarah and I both being the emotional meat bags we are, stop hugging and head inside before one of us mentally breaks down (again). 

2 hours later my parents arrive, and we all sit down and formally meet for the first time. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention how this is the first time both my parents and I are meeting Sarah's family? Imagine how fucking awkward that shit is. I'll spare you all the cringeful details of all of us trying to make the whole situation a 'normal conversation'. 

Both of our mother's brought the sperm donor IDs. For those of you who don't know what that is, when a woman has received a sperm donor sample from a cryo-bank, it comes with a ID that is unique to that specific donor. Our mother's compare the IDs and... they're a match. Sarah and I were conceived from the same donor (which we had already guessed to be the case).

The rest of the night was spent discussing what to do going on. As much as I still had feelings for her, Sarah and I came to the conclusion of breaking up. We decided to go to a bi-weekly counseling therapist, to help us get past all this crap and transition into a sibling relationship. 

We spent the rest of our weekend catching up with our families and headed back to uni on Monday. 

As of now, 12 days later, Sarah and I are going to therapy together and we've maintained a friendly relationship, still keeping in touch throughout the week. Mentally, we're both much better but still have a long way to go. It's to early to tell, but I have hope for the future.

Q&A:

Q: When were you both conceived?

A: We were both conceived a month apart, and born 5 weeks apart.


Q: Do you guys look alike?

A: No, not really. The only thing we 'have in common' are our somewhat similar noses. 


Q: What were your ancestry results?

A: Idk why this was a really common question I got through pm, but [here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/am85w9/my_results/)


Q: What town are you both from?

A: No


Q: Why do you both care? You should stay together.

A: There's no way that's happening in this society, nor do I want it to happen. We'd have to deal with social and even legal problems (depending on the state). Also, we'd run the risk of conceiving a genetically unhealthy child if we chose to have kids. 


Q: Were you two able to find your biological father?

A: Sarah and I didn't match closely (in terms of 1st cousins and up) with anyone else on 23andme, and as of now, we no longer have a desire to find our bio-father. The genetic counselor mentioned we should keep an eye out for any future half-siblings taking the test.

TLDR: Confirmed incest with specialist, went back home with ex-gf/half-sister, moms confirmed the same sperm sample. Sarah and I have maintained a 'sibling-like' relationship and are currently in therapy.

AITA for (accidentally) hatching my roommates egg?,"Using a throwaway even though my roommate will immediately recognize this if she sees it.

Me roommate (22 F) and I (24 F) have been living together for six months and so far everything has been gravy. We're friends from college, live our own lives, and both do our share of the chores around the apartment.

A few days ago my roommate, we'll call her Claire, brought home an Emu egg. We live in rural Australia, so seeing an emu egg is not that big a deal, but then she told me she found it on a ""mound"" in the bush and I'm like holy shit is this an actual live emu in here? She just shrugged. I said it was fucked up to just take an egg that had a chick in it. She told me she thought it was ""abandoned"" and she was gonna try to get it to hatch.

Now at this point I pretty much washed my hands of the situation. I didn't like having this egg around but I wasn't gonna sabotage my living situation over it. She would keep it in her room under a heat lamp (she has a pet lizard that needs one), so I'd hardly see it.

Now, one day I come home from work and I'm completely wrecked cause I work on my feet all day. I walk over to the couch and sit down on this U-shaped cushion (kinda like [this one](https://secure.img1-fg.wfcdn.com/im/59675625/resize-h600-w600%5Ecompr-r85/4146/41464506/U+Shaped+Body+Pillow+Protector.jpg)) we've had forever and put some trash TV on. Of course I end up falling asleep lying on the couch.

Flash forward to a couple hours later and I wake up to Claire prodding me in the shoulder. I open my eyes and she is glaring straight at me, holding the egg right in my face. There is a tiny chink poked out of it ad the baby emu's beak is legit coming through. I scream and ask her why the fuck she is holding a hatching ANIMAL in my face. She tells me that she left the egg in the U-shaped cushion to ""incubate"" and that by sleeping on it for ages I had ""hatched"" it.

She said it was the egg's ""cooling period"" and by sitting on it I caused it to hatch premature. I told her she she should ""cool HER period"" and that she didn't know what she was talking about. I think she was just mad that I hatched the egg and not her.

Now she is talking about me LEAVING THE APARTMENT (the lease is in her name) over this.

I feel like it was an honest mistake and she shouldn't have stolen the egg and LEFT IT ON THE COUCH in the first place. So please, tell me, AITA here?!??",AmItheAsshole

I (25/m) just found out my pregnant GF (22/f) cheated on me. The guy got into a serious car accident.,"I am in shock right now. My relationship started to become strained after the birth of our first child. I found out during dinner with her fucking parents. Her phone started going off like crazy. It was from her friends and they fucking knew. She left her phone at the table to grab her coat after all the fucking waterworks. The bitch was fucking some dude called Andrew and it started recently. Recent enough for me to doubt that the child she carries is even mine. I broke her phone when she tried to grab it from me. Her parents threatened to call the police on me. I left with my son. I don't want her in my life. I don't want her to be involved with my child(ren????) life. I am so fucking angry right now. 

Edit: I want a relationship with my children and not her. I can't be a father long distance. Her boyfriend is brain dead. Her mother told me to ""HAVE SOME SYMPATHY"". FUCK THAT. My life is ruined.

Edit 2: Most users are assuming I am a US citizen. I am not. Once my contract is up, I will have to leave the united states. How an earth can I be a father if I can't even be with my children.

Edit 3: I picked up the damn phone out of curiosity. Holy shit. I was assaulted when tried to take it from me.  

Edit 4: Phone is still with me. I;m taking screenshots. I paid for it by credit card. My name on the contract.

Edit 5: Ok I'll get some therapy. Anger management or domestic violence? Same thing I guess.

Edit 6: Waiting for her to return before I do anything. Need to video myself leaving my apartment untouched and in peace for my own safety.  ",relationship_advice

Update!!! -My landlord called the cops on me for trying to pay my rent- cop made her let me pay- now I'm being evicted for non payment-Texas,"Thank you all so much for all the wonderful advice!!! I definitely feel more educated and informed about my rights now. 

I'm no longer being evicted and I got all of my late fees back as an account credit, except for $5, but at this point I don't even care to ask why.

 I used the property records to hunt down their main office in Houston(I live in Dallas) and forwarded them the same email outlining all the ways they had violated my lease that I had sent to the TAA, the City, as well as the apparently pointless (thanks, guys) BBB.

The guy there got me set up with the online payment system that they actually DO have, contrary to what the office manager here told me. Next month I can just pay online!

He went through my account, got it paid, and refunded me $125 in late fees as a credit. I actually overpaid $5, still, but it's mostly a win without having to go to court. 

I also now have the contact information for a pro bono place that specializes in housing, just in case I ever need it.

Husband finally admits to sleeping with someone else after months of denying it,"So, I have posted here a few times before about me finding messages that my husband had sent a few other women here and there from the start of our relationship into us getting married. When I found the messages I begged for counseling, answers etc. and he didn't want to do any of it. I also had suspicions about him sleeping around because I got an STD. He blamed me and thought I gave it to him.

A few weeks ago, 4/5 months after telling him I knew about the messages, he finally admitted to sleeping with someone else, and now he's doing everything he can to make us better and to have a 'healthy' relationship. Everyone at work knows about the cheating, everyone on both sides of our families know.

And here I am not wanting to make this work, not wanting him at all. I'm actually repulsed by his touch. His side of the support system thinks I'm being unreasonable for filing for divorce, not wanting to make this work, or try to get back to how we used to be. But after me begging and bawling in front of him asking for answers he still didn't give it to me. Only when his counselor was at our house, he told me. In front of him and his wife.

Anyone have insight to this situation? Am I being an asshole? I feel it's justified, and I'm not happy with him. I wasn't happy with him before all this started either. Was I going to leave him? No. But this is a deal breaker for me and he knew from the beginning of us talking what my stance on cheating is.",relationship_advice

(Final update) My (21F) boyfriend (22M) tried to gaslight me into getting plastic surgery.,"This is going to be the last post I make about this situation. I want to put the whole thing behind me and focus on moving forward now, but my last post got a lot of responses so I felt as though I needed to say at least something on the matter. 

A lot of you have been greatly helpful to me in this time and I appreciate that more than I can say. To those of you calling me an idiot or saying I was making excuses for him - I wasn't. Evidently I knew his actions were wrong, otherwise I wouldn't have made the post to begin with. I clarified that he was usually very nice to me because he was. He's helped me through panic attacks, paid for a lot of my food when I've had no money, defended me against a previous abuser, and always been very attentive prior to recent incidents. Of course I knew that his actions in my post were wrong, I was trying to stress that he is not normally like this & that he was not aggressive with me. This is a man that I felt safe with because he had given me all the reason in the world to feel safe with him. He protected me from a lot, and literally came to my aid at 3am once when I was alone and distraught on some random beach! Of course he had my complete trust.

Anyway.

Following my last post, I basically avoided him and confided in some of my rl friends about it. In doing so, one of them (lets call her Daisy) brought me to the realisation that I was never THAT insecure about my body, and that my boyfriend had simply been making me feel that way. It sort of feels like a weight has been lifted in that regard but the realisation made me so so so angry. I rarely get angry but talking to everyone and reading everything and learning more about gaslighting made me SO pissed. Then there was the icing on the cake - TWO of my friends confirmed that he did indeed go to Lucy's party (no shit) but Lucy hadn't actually wanted him there?? She's apparently very aware of his obsession with her and isn't entirely comfortable with it. Great! I guess I'm fucking blind.

That really was the final straw for me. So last night when I saw him, I asked him about the party again and whether he went to mine or Lucy's. Again, he said mine. I told him that I'm not an idiot and that our friends could all confirm his whereabouts. He seemed bothered that I had been talking to people about the situation and he started with the whole ""your jealousy is really getting bad"" shit and at that point I lost my temper. I told him that I wasn't jealous, I was just trying to understand why he was lying to me about something so dumb. It wasn't even a good lie. 

We had a pretty rough argument and I brought up his constant comments about surgery and as we argued, little things started dawning on me about other stuff he had previously done. I cried a lot. He kept trying to be calm but it didnt always work.

But yeah. I'll spare the gory details. I did try to break up with him but I don't think it sunk in. As far as I'm concerned we're over, but he doesn't seem to really get it yet. I'm sure he will soon. I've blocked him on everything and I'm going to keep my distance, but we have a lot of the same friends so fully cutting him out isn't going to be as easy as I would like. I'm done with this though. He dominated so much of my life and I'm still doubting myself so much about everything but i have a lot of good friends helping me. Apparently he was weird about Lucy even when he was with his ex, so I think I might talk to her about the situation. 

I wanna keep moving forward. I need to get past this fucking fog in my brain that he put there. When we met he told me he'd lost a sibling in a car crash, yet no one ever spoke about it and I thought that was strange. At the time I thought it was due to grief but now i think no one spoke about it because it didn't fucking happen. I had so much faith in this man and for a long long time he really was my best friend. I already miss him and it fucking sucks but frankly I've overcome worse.

I'll be fine.

Thank you for your support. All the messages were very overwhelming but I read every single one of them and they did help. I hope you're all having a wonderful day.",relationship_advice

I think villains should win far more often,"It's not very exciting watching a movie and always know that the heroes will win. Take infinity war for instance, the amount of hype it got was so worth it, since he actually managed to snap his fingers.

Or every superhero movie/game ever. You always win, and there is always the villain who lose.

Star wars, World of Warcraft's lich king, every movie (except from 300 as far as I recall) the heroes win. I don't like it.

Edit: a lot of you keep saying that if the main hero everyone likes suddenly dies, they would feel unsatisfied. All those hours spent on that hero, for him only to die is bad.

Reply: the hero doesn't have to die to lose. They don't have to live. My example for great movies where the good guys lost is 300 and infinity war. I don't want to analyse how it made them good atm

TIFU By Accepting a Proposition for a Threesome,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, it happened last summer. Newly obligatory this will not end in incest. I didn't accidentally eat out my cousin or half-sister or whatever dumbass erotica you're all posting lately. Obligatory TL;DR at bottom.

&#x200B;

It's a perfect summer night in 2018. I'm leaving a job that I hate with my life, freshly broken up with, ready to throw on my leather and fuck anyone in arm's reach. I turn up to my local watering hole right before 1 AM,  toss back a couple beers and post up, alone, on the outskirts of the main bar.

&#x200B;

Last call rings out, the bar is mobbed. I lock eyes with a moderately attractive girl (MAG) who approaches me shortly after. She's equal parts drunk/horny, and does not hesitate to let me know. She's celebrating a friend's birthday with a squad of girls, one of whom sidles up to us and starts hitting on me hard.

&#x200B;

MAG is totally fine with this, and the friend would land on the higher end of the BMI chart, leading me to believe I'm being hit with a bait and switch. They SWIFTLY disprove that theory by literally asking if I ""want both"" of them. Worth noting that this is the only time I've been anywhere near a threesome, before or since, so I jumped at the chance.

&#x200B;

Next thing I know, we're in a cab on the way back to whoever's house the birthday pregame was. There is alcohol EVERYWHERE. They're feeding me shots/cold buffalo chicken dip like it's my last day on earth. Some girl is crying on the couch.

&#x200B;

My drunk ass picks up the signal that an ex-boyfriend is the cause of this girl's sorrow. Having been recently broken up with, I know exactly where her head is at. Having done far too many shots, I am not scared to console this crying stranger. Soon I will be the Advice Champion, and fuck every girl in the house.

&#x200B;

I launch into my speech, hitting every point she so desperately needs to hear:

* You're so much better than him.
* He *OBVIOUSLY* doesn't deserve you.
* You'll look back and laugh at this in a month.

&#x200B;

I'm now starting to notice that the cheers and applause I was waiting for are actually all death stares, even a few dropped jaws. As it turns out, this girl's boyfriend didn't break up with her. 

&#x200B;

No, he fucking ***DIED.***

&#x200B;

The guy died in a car accident and I'm telling her she'll be laughing about it in a month. Nobody fucked anybody that night.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I was invited back to a girl's house for a threesome, got very drunk and tried to console a girl crying over her ex-boyfriend that she's better than him, etc. He didn't break up with her, he fucking died.",tifu

TIFU by playing a Jackbox game with my girlfriend's family,"A little background: my girlfriend's family is extremely conservative. Like goes-to-church-twice-every-Sunday-and-never-swears conservative. While they are really nice people, it's a challenge for my heathen self to successfully endure a whole weekend with them without saying something that brings shame to my name. Onward...

So earlier tonight, my girlfriend's family decided to play some games together. We settled on Drawful (a game that allows you to draw things from your phone). This is where things go south... 

After choosing our character names, you have to draw your character. Seems cool, right? However, this is my first time playing and everyone failed to mention that once you start drawing, YOU CAN'T ERASE. So being the funny guy I am, I draw this huge, veiny dick and secretly show it to my girlfriend in front of me. We have a good laugh because we both knew damn well that her family would be mortified if it showed up on the screen. As a joke, my girlfriend pretends to hit ""submit,"" on my phone. In reality, she REALLY DID HIT SUBMIT. Next thing I know, my character name pops up on the tv with a huge, contoured schlong. There was no mistaking this beauty, either. I feel my heart skip a beat. I looked around and accidentally make eye contact with her 12-year-old sister, who looks at me with a disappointment unmatched by anything I've experience before.

I panic. I try to exit out of the game, but my Dick-asso masterpiece remains in the center of the screen. I stare at my phone to avoid the look from her parents. I try to pretend that I have no idea what happened. 

The game starts and every round, without fail, my pork sword drawing makes it way around the screen. I don't say a single word. The room is uncomfortably silent. I hear the occasional giggle from my girlfriend, and I'm doing my best not to explode inside.

The game FINALLY ends after what feels like a year. I select the new character screen and her dad says, ""What? You don't want to keep your big penis on there? Jesus would be so proud on this Easter weekend.""

Safe to say my girlfriend (more her family) isn't the one for me. 

TL;DR: I played Jackbox's Drawful with my girlfriend's family. I joking drew a huge dick as my character and my girlfriend accidentally submitted it. So there I was on the tv, identifiable as a veiny dick in front my girlfriend's sheltered, conservative family...


EDIT: the comment about her not being the one for me was sarcastic. We've been together for almost two years. I'm just mortified to show my face to her dad for a while",tifu

I get the girl I'm with to call an ambulance. We go to hospital together.

Doctor says he has to squeeze my dick to stop the swelling in my mushroom tip. I freak out like fuck. He says he may need to circumcise me... i freak out beyond belief. 

The girl is with me comforting me the whole time.

I experience next level pain as the doc squeezes my dick. First time no luck, 2nd time no luck... I'm in agony and the painkillers aren't doing shit.

3rd time he goes and voilá, back to normal. 

I thank the doctor and apologise for screaming, he says its ok.

Leave the hospital, thank god that I still have my most precious possession and go home.

The girl still wants to see me... despite her seeing me at my worst, she still likes me... i think i love her

Tl:dr - foreskin doesn't go back up after sex... go to emergency room where doc squeezes my dick... my girl is next to me watching the whole thing but still wants to see me again.

EDIT: A lot of people criticizing me for calling the ambulance and wasting their time. Listen, I was scared and afraid that something severe would happen to my dick. If I didn't treat it things could have turned out very badly. I spent roughly 146USD on this and I don't regret it at all. It's easy to judge me when you're not the one in my shoes but the worst was going through my mind.

I still need some advice and insight. 

I read every response and read all the DMs I was sent, but I wasn't able to respond to everyone. I got some great advice from that thread, and I followed through with some of it. I have a couple of updates I wanted to share. 

Original Post here: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/al10mq/my_36f_boyfriend_41m_of_45_years_ran_into_his/


It seemed like there was a mixed response on whether or not I should try to message her or not. I thought I try to get in touch with her anyway, thinking she'd either ignore it, block me or respond. She and I talked for several hours on facebook, and gave me the rundown of the worst years of their relationship. (I was at my mom's house when this happened). I asked her about their relationship, if it was really as bad as she made it seem, how did it end and a few other questions. She told me that their relationship was great the first 3 or so years they were together, that he was the best boyfriend she had ever had at that point. He was used overly flattering ways to compliment her, showered her with gifts, brought her to nice restaurants, drove her around wherever she wanted b/c she didn't have a car at the time. But, once they moved in together things started to go downhill. She was living in an apartment by herself for awhile, and he asked to move in because he was being evicted from his apartment. She agreed at the time. He tried to explain that he had paid his landlord in cash, but the landlord denied ever getting money from him. She gave him the benefit of the doubt with that excuse, but remembered it being a big red flag she ignored. 


As time went by for the last 2 years they were together, things got progressively worse. He began drinking more, he denied using drugs but she was confident he was doing cocaine as he displayed almost all the signs of a coke user. (Staying out all night with his friends, not coming home until 7-8am in the morning, seemed erratic and would talk really quickly and what he said didn't make any sense). The more he drank and used drugs the more aggressive he became. At first he would pick arguments with her, he'd get angry, maybe even call her some hurtful names or say mean things about her. He would sober up and do everything he could to apologize and seek forgiveness. He started to use his alcoholism as a crutch and would use the excuse ""it doesn't count when I'm drunk"" with her. She said she was young and stupid enough to believe that excuse, and stayed with him and wanted to help him sober up. He even agreed that he had a problem and would let her help him. But, he would keep getting drunk every night and would make her feel ugly, stupid, worthless whenever he drank too much.  


She said she remember feeling like the life was draining out of her as she tried to help him. She knew she was in a bad place and didn't have it in her to ask for help, stand up to him or leave. She was ashamed of the situation she got herself in to and just stayed. 


Kate said it got to the point where he would get absolutely wasted every single day. He would start drinking in the morning and continued through the night. She said she remembered finding a cache of empty bottles behind a free standing cabinet in her apartment. She said that finding that stash was bizarre, she didn't understand why he didn't just throw them away. But was also surprised that the way this piece of furniture was placed that you couldn't easily see the bottles, and the shape of the furniture created a space to perfectly hide those bottles. She didn't touch it once she found it, but monitored it and saw that it grew in height quickly. And the quality of the alcohol went down, like the bottom of the stash had top shelf liquor, and the upper bottles became shit like everclear. She never saw him buy these bottles or have them out in the open. He would lie about being drunk even though he was clearly out of it. She remember she kept a few airplane bottles of liquors for herself to make a cocktail, but a lot of them were things that needed mixers- like kahlua, godiva chocolate, baileys other milky-chocolatey drinks or fruity alcohol no one would choose to just drink by itself. But, she remember opening up her little stash of those tiny bottles and every single one was empty.  


Their fights progressed when he was getting even more wasted. He would become extremely violent. She said he would take any nearby object - plate, cup, beer bottle, wine bottle, one of her things, etc and just slam it as hard as he could against the floor, wall or brick fireplace. Sometimes he would throw these objects at her and she would have to find something to shield herself with. She remembers shielding from shards of glass flying at her a lot. These outbursts were extremely frequent, she said she tried to clean up the glass on the carpet with her vacuum but it never seemed like enough. So she started to always wear shoes in the apartment after stepping on a shard of a glass a few times. In addition to throwing things, he punched a hole in one of the kitchen cabinets, almost ripped a door off of one of its hinges and purposefully broke things that were part of the apartment. He would also back her up against a wall or a corner punching himself in the face or chest while screaming at her. She doesn't remember what he was saying she just remembers crying and telling him to stop whenever this happened. 


She said she remembered getting to a point towards the end of their relationship where she didn't want to have sex with him anymore. She said she was successful most of the time when trying to refuse him. But, sometimes if she refused he would get angry and either scream or throw something. She'd have sex with him after that because she didn't want the violence to escalate. She also said she tried to pretend she was asleep, pretend that she was sick, pretend she had to get up early and other excuses - and he would just go for it anyway. She said that she tried simply saying ""no"" and he ignored her on multiple occasions or would get angry until she gave in. She remembered being too scared to say to no to him and just lied there with her eye closed and he got angry because she wasn't in to it. She also said she doesn't have a number of how many times that happened, but it happened a lot. 


She also told me about the night she realized he was likely kind of crazy in a very bad. That she was scared of him, but didn't think he was crazy but just a violent asshole, but the following event made her feel like she was in a different kind of danger.  At one point she got brave enough to tell him that she didn't love him anymore, that she wanted him out of her apartment asap and that she never wanted to see him again. He got angry and was screaming that if that is what she wants then she'll never have to see him again. He slept on the couch that night and told her while she was at work he would pack up his things and be gone from her life. When she came home from work that night, she walked into him playing a video game with a mutual friend. He had cleaned the apartment, bought her favorite beer and was acting super cheery like nothing had ever happened. After the mutual friend left she asked him what was going on they had the fight and he was suppose to leave, and he said something along the lines of ""what? that never happened.""


He would frequently make her feel crazy and question her reality. He would lie to her constantly and always about things she couldn't prove were true or not. That he often lied about how he needed to spend money on his car, or he needed to buy new clothes for his job, or that he owed someone money for something. He would make her think that she was always the one in the wrong whenever they argued. She said he always found a way to turn the argument around on her. He would do things like always leave the apartment unlocked and tell her she was the one who forgot to lock the doors. He would also hide things from her and claim he never moved them. 


She was only able to escape that situation by lying about the day that the lease ended. She had told him that the lease was ending in month, when in reality it was a couple of months. She told him she was moving out to a different city to go back to school and he needed to make arrangements. Since he never paid any money for anything, he had no idea that was a lie. Once he left she stopped answering any phone calls or emails from him. She was concerned that he ended up moving to the same city she moved to. They met in her college town, she moved back to her hometown. He also moved to her hometown (where we live now, but it's a much bigger city than the college town FWIW). 


I asked her about stalking concerns, and she said that the first year they were apart he would try to call her from different phone numbers for awhile. She's still afraid of answering the phone from numbers she doesn't recognize. She also said she's confident that he would drive down the same street her parents lived on (where she was living for awhile after she left him). She said she doesn't think he has tried to find her in recent years, but it remains a fear of hers. She said said that this was the first time he approached her, but she remembers she saw him at the mall once and ran away immediately and went home. She also saw his mom once in public, but left before his mom saw her. 


She said the things that she had told me up to this point in the convo were things that happened frequently, they weren't one-off events, they were things that happened several times a week. By the end of their relationship she was extremely depressed, she had suicidal thoughts, she thought she was worthless, she had to get therapy for depression, PTSD and anxiety. She told me that even though it's been 10 years she will still have a nightmare about him. She even told me that she remembered waking up to her own screams a few times after their relationship ended. 

She continued to tell me there were a handle of violent or crazy one-off events that stick out in her mind - 

* He once got so angry and violent, he pushed her down on the bed.

* He once pushed her so she fell backwards onto a couch. 

* He once put his hand around her throat and closed in just tight enough to scare but to not make any marks or cut off her breathing. 


* There were two times where she needed help paying the bills, she usually didn't ask him because he would complain about her only being concerned with money. But both of these instances were the same - she asked for money, he took out cash from his wallet and threw it in her face, and told her he was going to buy her something nice but isn't going to anymore. 


* When they were visiting two of her friends (who she knew didn't like him), he made it a point to deeply embarrass her - told her friends that she had slept all day, was lazy and he's okay with it and is okay taking care of her and cleaning up after her mess. 


* He visited her at work and asked for $10 cash. She told him that she needed that money to buy lunch, he said he would bring her lunch, he took the money and never came back. 


* He almost got her fired from her job - she had a job where they got products early and had a specific release date. Their manager would allow them to take home the product to learn about, but only if they prepaid for it. This was against store policy, but everyone kept their mouth shut. He went to a different location and blabbed to the employees there about what they did at her store, one of those employees happened to be a district manager visiting that store. She didn't get fired, but he ruined a fun perk for everyone. 


* When he would go through phases of unemployment she would try to get him to do some basic chores while she was gone. Things like load/unload dishwasher or take out the trash. She remembered that she asked him to take out the garbage, which he agreed to do. She put the garbage by the front door, it sat that for awhile. It sat there long enough to where a few more garbages bags piled up. He kept saying he would take out the garbage. She remember getting annoyed because it started to smell really bad and the bags were leaking. So she gathered them up and threw them away herself. When she got back inside he was angry and told her he was about to take out the garbage that minute. 


* She asked him to clean the kitchen once, when she got home from work he was in the kitchen cleaning but very sarcastically and in a mean tone said ""are you happy now?"" 


She also told me that after she went through therapy she realized that he very likely had NPD or at the very least a lot of narcassist tendencies. She remembered the following characteristics he displayed frequently: He thought very highly of himself, he thought that he was more intelligent, more attractive and simply ""better"" than others. He felt like he didn't need to have a real job ever, that he would just get the things he wanted one way or another. He ended up with free rent, free food, never having to cook or clean while he was with her. She said he trouble keeping jobs because he would always go in late, and even got caught stealing from one place. He would frequently talk about how people in his life were lesser than him, and how he was using and manipulating the people he worked for. He would also get angry if he was every in a position where he had to clean up after himself or perform a chore at home. He spoke and dressed in a manner that gave him the illusion that he was superior. He made it a point to speak by using ""big words"" instead of speaking plainly. He always wore higher end clothes - button up shirts, nice slacks, nice shoes, even though he didn't have the kind of job to support those buying habits.


After we spoke, I started to connect the dots of other things he does. And things he has done in the past that I never thought too much about. A lot of her comparisons of NPD was eerie, as he still displays a lot of those traits but not to the extreme as she described.  


She also told me to get a background check on him, she said the last she knew he was found guilty of the following: assault on a female, 2 DUIs, hit and run property damages, several drug (pot related) charges, and a theft charge. I never thought to ever do a background check on anyone I know, I guess I'm stupid to just trust people. But, I confirmed everything she has said, but it looks like he's been clean for the past 6 years.. whatever that means. Everything I found I was able to google his name + arrest records. The last thing he was arrested for was Fall of 2012, of what I could actually find online alone. 


I kept trying to get him to talk about what happened last weekend, but he kept refusing to talk about it. He eventually got really angry with me, more angry than I've ever seen him be before. His face got really red and it almost looked like was trying to hold himself back from reacting. I was honestly a little scared. I haven't told him I talked to her. She also informed me that she would be blocking me after our conversation ended because she didn't want any ties directly relating to him. 


I told my mom my boyfriend and I were having troubles and asked to stay with her for awhile. She said I'm welcome, as well as my son, to stay for as long as I want. 


So, I've packed a bunch of stuff for me and my son while he was at work and told him that we were going to stay at my mom's for a bit until he either wanted to talk or go see a therapist. However, I'm not sure I even want to continue the relationship anymore. I'm seeing him in a different light now and I don't like what I see. I guess it's time to find a lawyer and tell them about my situation. 


tl;dr: Reached out to Kate, his ex, on social media we talked for hours online while she described everything about their relationship which was horrifying. She told me to look into getting a background check for him - he has assault charges, DUIs, drug and other charges I could find. He got extremely angry and a little scary the last time I tried to get him to talk. My son and I are now at my mom's. Now I need to think about next steps.

AITA for walking out of Thanksgiving dinner after my family went out of the way for me. It was a DISASTER.,"There are a lot of moving parts to this story, but here's a brief backstory. 

Every year since I was a child thanksgiving has been held at grandmas. In 2012 my step uncle took advantage of me being blacked out drunk, came into the room I was passed out in, and molested me. Took years to get over it. My whole family still talks to him. As if it never happened. Pretty sure no one believes me. This man lives in another state. 

So fast forward to this year and a week before thanksgiving grandma calls to give me a heads up that this man will be in town this year. So obviously, myself and my husband and two kids won't be going. I am the one who has to rearrange my plans, my family has to miss out. Not him. Which I think is just mind blowing... but moving forward. 

My mom is torn. She feels bad for grandma but also wants to see me and her grandkids. So she decided to hold thanksgiving at her boyfriends house for her immediate family. She tells me to be there at 5, but that I can come over whenever. I'm tasked with desserts so I spend my day baking pies and wrangling my twins to get everyone ready. 

We arrive at 5:30ish. Late as usual. It's a kid thing. Things are going great. Food is delicious. We decided to play cards against humanity and I leave to run home and grab it really quick. While I'm gone husband calls to say my mom, sister, brother, and the boyfriend and left to grandmas but will be back soon. TWO god damn hours pass and they still aren't back. They've been gone longer then they were there meanwhile we are in this house with two other people we don't really know. The roommate of the boyfriend and another girl. I'm furious. 

So I decided we are leaving. I pack everyone up and text my mom as we get in the car and she says they are almost there. She also sends another text that was a little garbeled but said that I'm not leaving because we are going to get.. and I quote, ""tore up from the floor up."" Let that sink in for a minuet. My MOM, who has never said that in her life, is speaking to me like a 17 year old thot. What in the actual fuck? So they show up and she is wasted. We are all outside and I say three times we are leaving just because I want to go. She pushes for an answer and I blow up. I tell her it's complete bullshit she left in the middle of OUR thanksgiving to go to grandmas. Like why didn't she go earlier in the day?? It's bullshit that she assumes I'd want to get drunk on this day. I don't drink on thanksgiving. I haven't since 2012 because I CANT. I'm always the DD and I prefer it that way. Too much anxiety. 

My bitch ass sister decided to pipe up and says ""but we moved thanksgiving for you!"" And that's where shit hit the fan. I didn't ASK for that. I asked to see them in a different day. They didn't move thanksgiving FOR me, they moved it BECAUSE of me. Because it's awkward for everyone apparently. I hear my sister loudly apologize to her boyfriend for having to witness such a monstrosity as her black sheep sister, and I get in the car. We drive away and I haven't heard from my family since. I ruined everyone's thanksgiving. I feel extremely angry at my family, but I also feel guilt. I have no idea why. AITA? 

Edit 1: spelling. Sorry, on mobile and type all angry and fast to get it out. 

Edit 2: Holy Support! First off, to all of those who suspect karma farming, I promise you that is not the case. I don't have much karma. This is my very first post that has done this, and I didn't intend for it to. Secondly, trauma guilt is a thing. I wish I would have posted the issue with my uncle and family years ago. It would have saved me a lot of questioning my own sanity. I feel validated, yes! But I came here to check my self to make sure I wasn't actually the asshole. Because it wasn't clear until now that I truly Am NTA! Thank you to everyone for the love and supporting comments! I needed to hear this so badly! 

Edit 3: Answer to the ""how did you know if you were blacked out."" I posted this is in the comments but I guess after awhile people don't read all the way down. 

Quite the personal story,  but I'm in a place I can talk about it so okay.

The next morning I had frames of memory that I original felt like were a dream. The whole thing is foggy. He approached me the next morning and asked me if I remembered. I said something like ""uh no"" and he told me that I had sucked his dick. I told him there was no way. Literally used the line ""even if you were Channing Tatum"" there was no way. I remember that clear as day. That afternoon he left and sent me a text telling me that I better not tell anyone. That if I did we would both loose or marriages. I spent a good 4 months pretty fucked up. Going over those frames of memory, trying to make sense of it. I felt dirty. I felt like maybe I had been wrong. Maybe I didn't remember right.

Through counseling those frames became a little bit clearer. I was walked through accepting what happened that night, being reminded of key details that proved to my brain that I was not at fault. Details like my husband walked me into the bedroom to put me to bed because I was drunk. He took of my shoes, tucked me in, and closed the door. I remember that. At some point this uncle open the door. Came in, uninvited. THAT is the key I hold to reminding myself I am not at fault and I should not feel dirty or guilty. Lots of therapy.

(FL) Help! My girlfriend is threatening to tell the police I abuse her if I leave her and I am terrified for my future.,"Posting this here after originally posting on r/relationshipadvice.

My girlfriend is threatening to call the cops on me if I leave her and has told me in a very serious conversation that she will tell them I beat her and will take me to court and have me arrested. She has told me on the day that I leave her she will come to my house and wait outside, call the cops and tell them I just kicked her out after hitting her. I just started a new job and I have no criminal record and am absolutely terrified this girl will ruin my life. Should I get a restraining order before any of this could happen? Please please help me I am in serious fear for my future, career and life.

A few changes that happened last night from my original posting of this: almost every comment recommended I get a recording, so once she calmed down a bit I did tell her she needed to tell me on recording that I have never hit her and she did, only it was a close up to her face and not her entire body and she was laughing a bit thinking it was a joke just so I'd calm down. Even though she admitted to the fact that I don't hit her, could a good lawyer argue that I forced her into this admittance since our environment can not be seen?",legaladvice
AITA for excluding my blind friend from my wedding?,"I have a friend, Bobby (not his real name), who struggles with his eyesight. He's quite quiet and solemn most of the time, but he's a solid guy and he's good to spend time with. We met at college a couple of years ago and have taken tons of classes together. First year we lived together, and have stayed friends since I moved out. After the first couple of weeks of knowing him, it emerged that he was registered blind. He's not completely without his sight so it's not like we didn't notice this guy with a cane and a dog, it's just that he needs mega sized text to read, and he's not allowed to drive or get his license. He's completely independent though, and has a free public transport card to get the bus and train since he can't drive. He's always been a bit of a home bird as well, so every weekend he'd travel  about 2 hours back up home, and 2 hours back, so that he could visit his mum and dad.


Now my fiancé and I have been dating for over 4 years and have been engaged for 18 months. As is the way with weddings, we sent out save the dates and invites along the way, and Bobby received both. Because I'm not a very organised human, the wedding invites went out a little later than they traditionally might, but since everyone who was coming knew about the wedding in advance, and received a save the date, it was fine. We had a few people who missed the RSVP date by a couple of days but no harm no foul in my eyes. The RSVP date was set for exactly one month before the wedding. 


Background backgrounded. Now for the potential assholery.


Bobby also missed the RSVP date. He wasn't the only one I had to chase up a week later, but he was the only one who read the message and then took two further days to reply with a yes. Today, less than two weeks before the wedding, he's messaged saying he can only come to the wedding if he can have a plus one. The reason for his plus one is his eyesight. Because he doesn't drive and he's not local he needs someone, his mum, to be present to drive him there and back. I flat out told him no, he's not inviting his mum as a plus one because we've already told the hotel the number for the meal, but she's welcome at the rest of the day. 
The hotel in reality doesn't need the numbers up till 48 hours before, but the table plans are set, there's no easy space to slot her in, and I don't want a friends mum that nobody knows enjoying the wedding meal and speeches, and us paying for the privilege. I now doubt whether he'll come, because I don't know if she's happy coming all the way, to not even be fed.


Am I the asshole?




*Edit:* A few things to update here. I've been chatting to the friend more. Despite what you all think, I do actually care and the nuances of how much a person can see can't be put across in a AITA post. The mother is welcome at the full day, except the meal. And by the tone of Bobbys message, it wasn't Bobby asking for his mum to be there, but Bobbys overprotective mum asking that she attend. Ceremony and evening do is fine, and I told Bobby as much when he first messaged yesterday. I've since reached out and offered to pay for the mum at the second restaurant that's on site.

Additionally, something of note is that my family are all not local. It's either a flight or a ferry for them to get to the wedding, and to cater for both my family and other guests who can't/won't drive, we hired a bus for a city centre pick-up. The bus takes people down to the church, then back to the reception venue. It's only getting home again that people need to manage themselves, but various people are staying in the same hotel that the reception is at. Travel arrangements have been a big part of the wedding, and Bobby has been invited to use them from the start.

To those saying he needs eyes for the evening. I'm not disagreeing with you to be flippant of his needs, or to be callous, even if I am still an asshole. I'm saying having known him for 2 years, he doesn't need his mother there. There are plenty of college friends there, who he's seated with, who can help him find his seat or point out the loos. It's a group of friends and we've all been there to support him when necessary (which is genuinely rare, because as I said, he is *fully* independent, even in new environments).

I (27M) am leaving my gf (25F) because she's been trying to have an affair,"This is hard. We've been together for nearly 8 years. We built a life together. 

So, there's so much to this but basically I did that thing that everyone in a relationship should be wary of. I looked through her phone. And I found messages upon messages from a mutual friend who lives out of state now that were concerning. Initially I was gonna leave right then and there but I wanted to try to talk to her. So I gave her almost 3 chances to own up to it. The first time I was really vague and just asked if there was someone else. She flat out denied. I thought I was prepared for her to deny but turns out I wasn't. Then the other times I got more and more pointed. Finally she admitted that the guy had messaged her and flirted with her but we knew he was that way and while she didn't tell him to ""fuck off"" she wasn't into it. 

Now I didn't see any messages from her at the beginning that showed she was exactly complicit in it. So while I didn't believe her I tried to give her a chance. I know it's stupid but we've been together for so long and we built a life together.

But then I dug again. And there it was. All of it. And worst she took the time to insult me to him. That hurts. So fucking much that hurts. I know my faults and I know what I could've worked on in this relationship but I really tried. Everyday I tried. But for her to tell someone else things about me like that, I can't help but feel broken. 

So, right now I'm waiting for her to wake up and leave for work. Then I'm packing what I can and heading to a friends place and....I don't know. I spent 8 years on this relationship and I'm gonna walk away from it. 

I wrote a note out on my phone that I'm gonna write up for her after she leaves. It says everything I can think to say. I mulled over what to say nonstop. Somewhat satisfyingly I'm gonna tell her how she did this. To know that and remember that. And that if at any point she thinks we can ok that she fucked this and hurt me so much. 

I'm scared I'm lost and so much so I don't want to have to do this. 

But I have to and I know ultimately it's going to get better. But also fuck all of this. 

Edit 1: she's up now and getting ready for work. She tried to kiss me and apologized about tossing and turning all night and she knew it kept me up. 

I seem to be getting a lot of push back on the letter. When she leaves I'm gonna pack and I'll mull it over again. But I'll say this, if I decide to write and it ends up being a mistake then so be it. It felt nice to at least draft it out on my phone. Made things more real so I can convince myself more that I have to leave. 

Edit 2 (8:30 AM) she just left for work. I'm going to shower and truthfully let out a nice cry. Then pack my stuff. Lots of people are saying to straight ghost her and lots are saying a short and to the point note instead of letter. I'm gonna contemplate that in the shower. 

She kept saying ""I love you"" and I was reluctant to say it back. She said it 3 times and I kind of grumbled it out once. I'm certain once she reaches work she'll text me about that. 

I'm not going to respond to her while she's at work. She won't be home till probably 8 tonight. 

I just realized I should time stamp the edits maybe(?) I don't know 

Edit 3 (8:54) I'm packing up now. Cats seem to know something is up because they won't leave me alone. Honestly breaks my heart. 

I've been mulling the letter over. I reread it a few times. And I've decided on a short note just laying out that I know and I'm leaving. Essentially something like: 

""I left. I know about you and him [insert what I read and saw]. I'm so utterly disappointed in you. I won't be answering my phone and I wish for you not to contact me. At some point we'll get together to discuss logistics.""

Also, I am reading everyone's comments. If I didn't reply I'm sorry. To the people that have commented about going through something similar, i am so so sorry you're going through this as well. I don't know what you'll be able to gleam from my situation but I hope something here in all of this helps y'all as well. 

Edit 4 (9:25 am) I'm pretty much packed with what I can get out right now. Obviously there's a lot more. I'm writing the note and then leaving. I'll need to find food after I drop off what I have. This may be the last update since she won't be off till later tonight. But I'll respond to y'all when I can. Gives me something to do. 

Edit 5 (10:42 AM) I'm at my friends place. She's giving me the lay of the land. People have been talking about taking the cat. Currently that's not an option. Friend has 3 and a dog. My cats are spoiled and hate anyone that isn't her and I. I'm not worried she'd do anything to them. If anything she's gonna want them around if she does get upset. Not that she deserves that but it is what it is 

Thank you everyone for the kind words and the advice. I'll respond to some of you again here soon. 

Someone asked me about my work. I work in equine care. It's actually really cool, I LOVE my job and I love being there. So once I start going back in a few days it'll be a really good distraction. 

In a bit I'm going to get food and maybe walk around downtown and goof off. 

Also, my friend reminded me she's going out of town next week for a week. So I'll have the place to myself. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing. But hey she'll have someone to watch her animals while she's gone so there's that. 

I know I have a lot of figuring out to do. But I literally just left. 

Oh, and someone else mentioned they hope I find things to do to make myself happy. I had plans before all of this to go to ""the usual"" brewery with some friends tomorrow. Initially I was gonna call some of them and tell what's going on and I need space but thinking about it more it actually sounds like the perfect distraction.  

Edit 6 (1:45) Got food (banh mi and a mai tai if anyone was curious) and talked to a couple of friends. So I'm sorry I haven't been replying. It's gonna take a while to go through all the messages and comments but what I've seen so far I want to say for the umpteenth time thank you y'all. 

Edit 7 2:15 - Okay, this is my last update. Apparently I used a word that altright folks like to use but it was used to describe me so whatever. 

I'm still trying to go through all the comments but I saw some people had questions I'll do my best to address. 

The friend is...well a friend. I don't know what else to say on that. There's nothing there. A guy and a girl can be friends and that's it. If this is weird for you guys then I'm sorry? I mean I don't know if this is gonna be a straight move in. I'm still figuring things out. 

Some people have said I'm no better than her and 8 years and not being married was already a bad sign and etc. Well, I guess so? Like clearly this relationship isn't working out. Look what it lead to. If that's my fault or her fault or or fault or whatever it is the situation I'm in. 

And on the note of what it lead to, a lot of people asked me what exactly was said or done. I realize I kept it vague and I supposed it was cause I felt weird typing it out. But I don't mind telling you guys what I can. 

As far as I know she hasn't actually ""cheated"" ie fucked him. They messaged flirtatious things (calling eachother hot sexy etc) and their some pictures but no nudes. But the recent thing I found (and I'll touch on the going through the phone thing next) it was messages about wanting to fuck eachother. Straight up. That they missed a chance because of me. But, and this for me is the kicker, he apparently wants to make a [this is where that word was used] of me. And she seemed into it. They wanted to have sex and have me know they did. Which is why I don't think they have yet. 

On the going through the phone thing, I know it was dumb. I know what I did. I don't advocate. But it is how I found about all of this. I just had suspicions that something was going on with someone. So it did that for me. Would I tell the next person to go through their partners phone? I don't know. Probably not. I'd tell them if they find something it'll hurt cause this fucking hurts. And if they don't then they breached the trust and privacy of their SO for nothing and that in it of itself is a weird situation. 

I don't know folks. Does that help anyone? Should I elaborate more? ",relationship_advice

AITA for suggesting that the reason my female friends dislike my housemate is because he's not sexually interested in them?,"I (23M) live in a house share with 6 others. 2 other guys and 3 girls, we're all the same age.

Now the three girls I live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls in the club and got with them instead.  Since that day, these 3 girls have made catty remarks about him.

When we're in the kitchen (when Cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude Cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. They were doing it yesterday so I just chimed in and said ""Are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...I saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

AITA for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?,"So I'm 17 and I used to be morbidly obese. I was actually morbidly obese until last year when I decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. I'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and I feel really great. I went from 130kg to 70kg and I'm 5ft 9

Anyways my sister eats horribly. She is morbidly obese. My parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge Doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

Anyways I saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. The sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. My mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. It's absolutely insane I think And there was nice coke can to go with it. I told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. I offered her a Piece of tofu in which I was having for lunch. Tofu is actually delicious. More people should try it.

 She told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that I'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when I was a child(I wish someone did). Apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. My mother said I wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

"Witnessed car crash one month ago during honeymoon in FL, stayed around to give report to responding officer. Live in MA and just received subpoena to appear in court in August.","It was the first day of our honeymoon in Florida when we witnessed a car crash. My first instinct was to check the traffic lights at the moment of the crash so I could clearly tell who was at fault. My wife and I hung around the scene of the accident (no serious injuries thankfully) and gave our report to the traffic officer who responded. We felt good about ourselves for sticking around and doing our civic duty and figured that was that. 

Today, over a month later, we both received subpoenas in the mail to appear in court in mid August. The court is located in Florida but we live in Massachusetts. We are also both starting new jobs in the first week of August. 

I would REALLY not like to have to fly down to Florida on my own dime to testify, do I have any other options? Are any of the parties involved compelled to reimburse me for my travel expenses? Or am I SOL and should I just look for the cheapest flight down there ASAP? I'm feeling like that whole ""no good deed goes unpunished"" saying has never been truer.

AITA for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?,"When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.

Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and I said ""Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

Tifu by not understanding that 3.5 grams can be a fuckload,"This actually did happen within the last 24 hours, I'm still lying in bed trying to recover. 

So, weed has been legalized, yay Canada! Obviously, the first weekend after legalization, getting fucked up is in order. My girlfriend and I had a free weekend (kids weren't here), and that won't happen again for a while, which adds further justification. But we live in an apartment building, we don't want to stink everything up, so we decided to do edibles.

I figured, hey, let's keep it conservative, never done this before, don't want to put too much in there, right? I mean, not that weed can ever be that bad, haha, it's just marijuana. Fucking harmless. So I spend the morning and afternoon decarbing 3.5 grams of MK ULTRA and infusing it into half a cup of butter, which was then used to make brownies. Which were quite good.

We cut this shit into about 15 equal pieces. Now, I am still at this moment struggling with the math, which is pathetic given that we spent two hours trying to figure it out last night. But, I'm pretty sure that works out to 232 mg per brownie. *APPARENTLY* you should start with 10 mg. See how that goes. But on Friday night, we vaped through about 2 full grams and I didn't feel a damn thing.

We started with two brownies each. Two hours later, my girlfriend was fucked up. I was fine. So I had another one. An hour later, she could barely walk. I didn't feel it as bad as her. So, I had one more. That's 6/15, not even half the batch between us.

Turns out MJ is a helluva drug. Jesus Mother-fucking Christ. We spent about 6 hours completely fucked up. Oh my lawd, I had no fucking clue that that level of impairment was possible from weed. My mind is blown. I could not talk properly; sipping from a cup was this ""big deal"" where my girlfriend and I had to talk me through and encourage me; rolling over was this totally confusing repeated realization that there's a *whole other half of this room to look at*, wow!

We were wrecked. About halfway through, it went from being a laughfest to being a grim holding on. We just held hands and encouraged each other not to panic. My girlfriend thought she was dying, she was reciting her last will and testament to herself. She wanted to call an ambulance. None of this is hyperbole. We're both exhausted and sore from the twitching. The dry mouth might've been the worst part. It was incredibly intense, we had trouble talking because our mouths were so dry. 

We threw the rest of the brownies out. The smell of weed is going to make me nauseous for weeks probably.

TLDR: 125lb woman ingests half a gram of weed in brownies, 205lb man ingests almost a full gram. Both are amazed to discover that weed can in fact profoundly fuck them up. It waaaaaay too much.

Edit: thanks for the gold! And silver! And platinum! Kinda worth it...?

Edit 2: yes, it is a tragedy about throwing the brownies out. I honestly, sincerely hate the waste. But we couldn't even look at them this morning without our stomachs flip-flopping, and we absolutely could not risk the kids getting them. That would be unforgivably irresponsible. 

Edit 3: I *DID* do research, I just didn't do enough. We have now learned correct math from the comments. You're **supposed** to dose edibles using the THC percentage. This stuff has been tested at 18%. So, using that estimate, with 233 mg of weed per brownie, she had 84 mg and I had 168... Holy fuck.

Edit 4: I used the double boil mason jar method for about 60 min to decarb, then dropped a 1/2 cup of butter into the jar and let it boil for another 80 minutes. Every 10 minutes I topped up the water and shook the mixture around in the jar. There wasn't much smell at all. I can confidently state that this method works well enough to get a person high.

**Final edit**: Some important safety tips from someone who read the safety tips and didn't get it, and is now learning from hundreds of comments. For those making **positive** contributions, thank you! We're enjoying them! 
1. They say wait at least 2 hours before having another. *Wait longer*! Like, a day. It is not worth the risk of having too much.
2. There's a general agreement that edibles are much stronger, and that even someone with a respectable tolerance for smoking might get annihilated.
3. There's a lot of stories here where the impairment lasted days. I fucked up even bigger by not fully considering that. So keep that in mind. ",tifu
AITA for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.,"I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. 

I never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said ""Einstein"" once and John interrupted him to say, ""I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?"". I once put up a snapchat story saying, ""I love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""It's called gridiron you moron"".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

On one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went ""I'm a Biomed Engineer"". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

Every time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing"". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

Over the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, ""damn M0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like ""His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


At this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

Last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo"". To which he got angry again and said, ""I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you"". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

That's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, ""Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*"" 

His dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? ",AmItheAsshole

"I got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. After 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. I need help on how to handle this.","
I am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

At 16 I slep with my good friend Jared . The condom broke and my daughter was created. My parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. I couldn't bring it over myself to. I wanted to keep the baby. Ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. So I did. I went to my friends house and his parents took me in. They weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

In that time my friend and I started to develop feelings for each other.

I had my daughter and about 2 moths later Jared's  brother  came back into their life's. He was a recovering Heroin addict. As we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
Eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. My parents got wind of that. They dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my MIL also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

So they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. It was a dark time I thought they were going to take my baby. In the end they didn't find anything substantial.

But them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. As it was a small town every mistake I made got back to my parents.

I was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? Cps charges because neglect.
I was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . Cps.

Christmas loads of people stayed at Jared's house because it was a big family. Cps because many strange men were there.

They eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. If they had done it more I think it could have been an offence.

The last call was 5 years ago.

Eventually Jared and I married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. We worked retail jobs and studied. It took us longer than average to graduate but we did. With a lot of help of his parents. Jared is now an engineer and I work as a graphic designer.

We were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. Our life's look normal now.

Anyway a week ago I get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

I don't really know what to do. Because while they didn't have to take care of my while I was pregnant I wished they had at least supported me. And while I get that they were panicking because they thought I was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years.",relationship_advice

AITA for telling my girlfriend that her six y/o stinks and needs to be taught proper hygiene?,"First time poster here and I'm on mobile so I hope this goes well. Anyways, let's jump right in to the stank!

Me (24M) and my girlfriend (24F) had a baby boy one month ago today, and things have been pretty awesome. We've really come together as a couple and our communication has been healthier than ever; even our levels of trust and little displays of affection are through the roof. All in all, a potentially stressful and chaotic situation worked out pretty well! 

My SO has a six year old boy from a high school fling. The father moved several states away when he found out about the kid, and has only been around two or three times, for no more than an hour each time. Her son knows I am not his father but for the last three years I have tried to reinforce the fact that I am his friend and he can always talk to me. We play basketball together and we go bowling every weekend, as long as he behaves in school that week, so I would think to think that we are pretty close. 

So two days ago (Friday) after work, the three of us went bowling while my mother watched our newborn. As we're changing shoes, I notice a really gnarly odor akin to sour milk and garlic. I searched for the offensive smell and I realized it was my Gf's son's feet. When I leaned down to put all of our shoes underneath the table, I was about a foot away from him and couldn't help but notice he absolutely REEKED. I was a little boy once, so I shrugged it off and made a mental note to tell his mom later. 

As luck would have it, she brought up to me a few minutes later how he got made fun of at school that day for smelling bad and how it hurt his feelings. Me being the idiot that I am immediately responded with, ""SO, it smells like he hasn't wiped his ass properly in days. Does he use soap in the shower? Did you ever show him how?"" To which she blushed and vehemently responded that it was not appropriate for her to bathe with her own son. 

Now that he's six, I kind of agree, but I wasn't born knowing how to properly clean my body, I had to be taught. I told her that I felt as if it was her job as the sole parent to teach her son hygiene, otherwise this problem will never go away. I also stated that with our son, the newborn, I would 100% be taking responsibility for his hygiene so that I knew it would get done. She started to tear up and got really angry with me, so we finished our first game of bowling and left. She's been pissed at me all weekend. AITA here? Should I have handled that better?

TIFU by telling my son's new doctor we are Anti-Vaxx,"Obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

My son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. We decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. I brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

Toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""Well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which I reply, ""Oh, no he can't have that, I don't want him to get autism.""

I should maybe note here that I am an aspie too, and while I think my sarcasm is on point, I must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. The silence lasted an eternity while I imagine she was deciding how to proceed. Eventually I laughed and tried to assure her I was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

As my son and I were discussing whether I was offensive (he thought I was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines.

I think my husband might have caused our neighbor to commit suicide,"My husband and I live in a neighborhood where the houses in the street behind us have their garages facing ours. We share a connecting back alleyway. One morning, our neighbor's daughter was pulling out from her driveway when the back of her car hit our fence. It shook the fence but besides a smear of paint from her car and a decent sized crack in one board, there was absolutely no damage. We were both in the backyard when it happened so we knew what she had done. 

My husband went out to confront her. She started screaming and sobbing uncontrollably, begging him not to tell her father and repeatedly saying that he would ""kill her"" if she found out. She offered us money from her own savings to fix the fence. My husband accepted the money, which she brought us immediately. She kept asking if he would tell her father and he assured her that he wouldn't. After paying us, she left for the day. It was about 100 dollars in cash, although we had the boards and tools to fix the fence without any cost to ourselves. I wasn't happy but he insisted that it was good for her to learn a lesson in responsibility and safe driving. 

Later that week, we learned from our next door neighbor that the daughter had committed suicide. I believe that's what happened because another neighbor next door to the daughter's house confirmed hearing shouting and seeing an ambulance outside the house while my husband and I were at work. My husband was pale and shaken for a day or two after. When I finally asked him why he was taking it so badly, he told me that after the daughter left and I'd gone inside, he waited until the father came home from work and told him that his daughter had not only hit his fence but paid for us to keep it a secret. He said the father seemed angry and slammed the door but didn't say anything else.

I doubt the father murdered her; i have the mother on facebook and she is posting openly about her daughter's suicide which I don't think she could do if there was a murder investigation. I do think my husband took advantage of a frightened girl and reported her to an abusive father. He wants my support and to attend trauma counseling but every time I look at him, I'm just disgusted. I think about how he took her money and lied to her face. I don't want to throw away a decade worth of marriage but when he asks me to tell him it isn't his fault, I just stay quiet. We have no children together but he's the only family I have. I need advice, I don't know what to do. ",relationship_advice

Frequently, they will either offer a discount or a free replacement.","EDIT: People keep asking for examples, here are a few that come to mind, but there are many, many more. I may add more as I think of them. Here are a few companies that have taken care of me outside of warranty for items over $100, and only one I asked for it for free (Chevy out-of-warranty repair). 

* Nordstrom: jeans that split in the seams after about a year they replaced no questions asked.

* Apple: replaced two iPhones over the course of 3-4 years outside of Apple Care that were malfunctioning after I broke the screen. Never asked for free phone. Went in for screen fix, they just replaced entire phone free.

* Apple: 2015 MacBook Pro having random issues. They thought it was the battery / fan assembly and charged me $220 to replace, but said it could be the logic board. If Logic Board, I would pay the difference ($550 minus $220). They even gave me a written quote. Found out after another month it was the Logic Board, but when I brought back in, they offered to replace the Logic board free for the inconvenience of bringing in a second time, and I never even suggested getting a discount on it or acted inconvenienced. Just being friendly with the staff.

* Kühl clothing: had a $250 puffy winter jacket, picked up a hot soup pan and melted it clean through. Composed a very funny email and picture documenting and sent to them and asked if I could pay to have it repaired since I'm such a klutz and melted it. Instead, they immediately sent me a brand new jacket. I didn't even pay for shipping.

* Chevy: new-ish car at 40k miles or so. Needed expensive out-of-warranty repair after my car had already spent 3 weeks in the shop a few months earlier. I did ask for this one, because it was so close to the warranty period still and I wasn't terribly happy with the reliability record of the car. They obliged.

* Rode microphones: Shockmount for a professional microphone broke. I called customer service to order a new one (3-4 year old product), and saw they were $50 on the website. Just told him it broke and I wanted to order a replacement part, instead they just offered to send a replacement free of charge. Didn't even pay shipping.

* Verizon Wireless: broke screen on iPhone X, called customer service to see if I had the device protection (thought I did). Didn't ask for anything free, just asked her if there were any options available, the rep said she'd gladly split the cost of the repair with me and promptly credited my account for $137.50 right on the same phone call.

* Blinds company (?): found receipt, limited warranty, I admitted having to pull them down hard to get them to close, possibly being responsible for the damage. I paid shipping to send them in, they repaired for free.",LifeProTips

1. Insist on a paternity test. This isn't to disparage you, the mother or your choices, but it's a smart thing to do.

2. Get ready to be a good dad. Whatever your relationship is with the mother, dedicate your life to being a positive role model to the innocent baby you've involved with your choices.

3. Get your medical insurance straightened out now. During my OB rotations at UMC I saw more stress and heartbreak than I thought was possible simply because couples didn't know what was and wasn't covered.

4. Start saving now for day care, school, college, etc... Your dad can recommend someone.

5. Don't contact me again. This was a pretty classless request but since you know I love babies and kids I couldn't help myself because I truly hope you understand how serious this is and you grow and rise to your choices. Kacie **

AITA for expecting my daughter to help her brother?,"Me (50sM)

My daughter (32/f)

My son (27/m)

I love my kids equally.  

My daughter lives at home rent free, which has allowed her to pursue her passion.  We don't charge her rent and so she's built up a good deal of savings (~50k).  

My son is a bit more aimless.  He has a college degree, but he and his girlfriend have chosen to pursue a more nomadic lifestyle.  He supports them (gf doesn't work) and does odd jobs/gigs.  They have lived in Airbnbs for two years, until about a month ago.

Last week, my son came to me to speak in private.  Apparently, they have been living off of credit cards and now my son owes ~30k.  There's no way he'll be able to pay that off on his current job.  He has moved back in and is looking for more steady work, but it's going slowly as he has little career history to speak of.  Meanwhile, the creditors are calling constantly.  The debt will inevitably grow with interest.  My wife is pushing hard for son to file for bankruptcy to manage this. 

I don't want my son to file for bankruptcy.  It would be a huge stain on his credit and make some jobs impossible to get.  I believe my daughter should loan him the money out of her savings.  When I pass all my children will have is each other.  They should learn how to rely on each other more.  

I told my daughter I think she should loan son the money.  She got extremely angry and left to live with her mom.  Her mom, my wife, and my daughter are all angry at me now.

AITA for cutting my 15 year old son off?,"My son and I were very close. My ex and I divorced when he was 7. I was very much involved with him like coaching his sport teams.

Two years ago, I was hit by a drunk driver and ended up paralyzed from the waist down. Life as I knew it was over. I got through it because of that boy. I started going to his sport gamed and he asked me not to.

Why?

Because I am paralyzed, I have no bowl or bladder control. I don't even know if I have to go. Since I am hooked up to a catheter and wear diapers. I have a urine and colonstomy bag on the side of my chair. If I try hiding it, but sometimes it leaks. Plus, if not attached correctly then I can get an infection.

My son is embarrassed about this when I show up at his games not only in a chair but with bags. Last week, my bag was leaking and I didn't know until some told me. My son asked me to come to his games anymore because of it all. 

It hurt me so much that I cut him off. Like I'm an asshole for being paralyzed. I lost my job and live off social security. Still, I pay for all his sports. I go without eating some days. Since he doesn't want me at the games then I'm not paying for it.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into?,"Title says it all. My friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn't realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn't even have Candy Crush on her phone.

So I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn't do it).

After dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn't have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

As per usual this didn't happen today but this past Saturday. I (26f) was spending the day hanging out with friends by the pool, casually drinking and playing games. One of my friends decides to challenge me to a race to the other side of the pool. So we hop out and me, being the genius that I am, and very confident after being a competitive diver and swimmer for more than 10 years, decide to dive in from the shallow end. I go to take a running leap in and as I'm pushing off the deck, I feel my foot slip. I end up diving straight down, feel my neck crunch, and then blackout. I come to as I'm floating to the surface, back up, and tell my legs to just stand up cause I need to breath, but they don't respond. Most of my friends see me and think I'm joking, but very luckily my nurse and med school friend see blood and rocket into action. They stabilize my neck and flip me over in the water to breath and then get me up on the pool deck. In another incredible bout of luck, once I'm stabilized on the deck I can move my legs again. Friends call an ambulance (to which I am groggily and vehemently opposed to, thanks US healthcare prices) and once I get to the hospital I'm placed in the trauma ICU and CT scanned. I then find out I've pulverized my c2 and broken c1 and c3. And now I get bed rest and at least 3 months in a C collar. So yeah, don't dive in the shallow end folks! 

Tldr: dove in the shallow end, wrecked my neck like a hydraulic press

Today, I get to work and my supervisor congratulates me on being pregnant, and tells me they'll be speaking to me about the position later. Bewildered, I asked what she meant.

TIFU by going jogging - I'm bloody and afraid to go this route again.,"Unlike most TIFU posts, this happened just half an hour ago. 

I'm a 21 year-old male. I was out running my 2 miles. Headphones in, music playing, minding my own business. I round the corner at about the halfway point of the run and I see this big black duck looking at me. As I get closer, I think to myself, ""Man, that's a brave duck, why isn't he running away?"" I keep running and realize the duck not only isn't afraid of me or running away, he's running right at me. So I stop and squat down, thinking maybe he was hurt and needed help or something. This bitch ass giant fucking black duck takes a huge bite out of my leg. Like, not playing, drew blood kinda bite.

I'm thinking to myself, ""What the fuck?"" So I'm like, maybe he's just an asshole and I keep running think he will leave me alone. I start running again and the faster I run, the faster he chases me. I start sprinting and he is literally flying behind me attacking me. I'm thinking, ""I've got enough fucking problems in my life as it is man, I don't need this shit"" so I stop running again kinda like in disbelief trying to figure out what to do. In all my years of being a person, I've never trained for this.

This little punk ass duck is chomping on my ankles and it's actually really hurting. He starts grabbing my shoelaces and untying them as I'm trying to run backwards away from him. We've covered a quarter mile at this point. I try picking him up and throwing him back away from me every time he lunges for blood. I'm thinking, ""How the fuck am I gonna explain this if I have to go to the doctor for a duck attack? I'm a grown ass man. This is bullshit.""

I try running again and he keeps flying after me. I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm manage to get my phone and start texting my girlfriend, asking her what to do. Am I really gonna have to kill this duck to get away? Like, I don't want to, but I might have to actually fucking kick this duck or grab it by the neck? Seriously?"" We have covered 3/4 of a mile at this point. He bites me again and I drop my phone. I pick it up quickly. Who do I call? I've got fucking scars and cuts all over me. While I'm debating whether stand-your-ground laws apply to ducks, I hear a noise; Someone else was outside walking on an adjacent street and came to see what all of the commotion was.

This was a big mistake. The duck smelled blood, and gave up attacking me to chase after my savior. I saw my window and booked it home running the last half mile in 2:50 flat. I feel kinda bad, that duck has probably killed that dude by now. The last I saw of him was the look I took over my shoulder running away as he made the same mistake I did, looking down to see if the duck was hurt.

I cannot make this shit up. I would have recorded it, and I tried, but it's really hard to concentrate on unlocking my phone and trying to record video while you're being eaten by a fucking duck.

This is bullshit. I'm covered in cuts and bites. Most joggers are afraid of getting attacked by dogs, but this is something I was not ready for.

TL;DR I'm a grown ass man and got attacked by a giant duck and chased for over half a mile. I'm covered in blood.

TIFU by going down a Reddit rabbit hole.,"This didn't happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and I bought a new car. I was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. Don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.

I came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse Reddit while I'm taking care of my business. Most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. I can't remember what sub I was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. Before I knew it I was reading about ""The Donkey Show."" Yes that one. Some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. I wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so I just kept reading.

Someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how The Donkey Show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. Midget porn. I thought, ""What the hell, I've never seen this sort of thing before."" So I clicked.

As weird as it sounds, I clicked out of curiosity......I swear. What I saw was exactly what I expected to see. This specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. After a minute or so, I had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub I was in.

I finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. I get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

She was taking a while, so I grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. My wife comes out and gets in the car. Immediately she says, ""What the hell is this?"" I put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. On the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com"". I had never had a car with this feature before, so I was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. I knew I was screwed. It felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so I could change what was displayed on the screen.

After about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks I have a thing for little people. Before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. All I could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. Before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. I'm pretty sure I'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. Yay me...

She said to me one day, ""I know you won't leave me for another woman, but I'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

TIFU by blowing a burp in my dogs face.,"This Happened a few days ago. My dog, pouncer, is a half shih tzu, half poodle. Both breeds aren't that bright, old pouncer was left with a double dose of the stupid. I love him nonetheless, he's all i have. Every day i come home from work he's elated to see me. He's always been nervous and has some attachment issues.

After eating dinner i wind down on the couch, iron chef is on. Not the good one, the american one. It'll do. I lie down, pouncer lies on my chest, head near mine, all is good.

With out notice, the ghosts of my dinner come up to haunt me. Really it's my own fault, i shouldn't have thought nandos was an adequate meal substitution. No one should have to think that. I exorcise the faux-Portuguese demons from my mouth directly into poor pouncers face. I swear i didn't mean to. Pouncer perks, looking puzzled. He snouts out air a few times then freezes. Now he's looking at me and i'm looking at him.

I don't think i need to explain what happened... But i'll do it anyway. He threw up into my face. Not on, not around, into. The vomit traveled up my nose so far, i swear i could taste it. Within milliseconds i start to throw up. Whilst gasping for air, spicy nandos vomit is traveling back down into my lungs, scarring my insides. I run to the bathroom, strip down and have the most uncomfortable shower of my life.

As i leave the bathroom to go clean the ungodly mess left in my house, i find pouncer is happily cleaning it up for me.

He's all i fucking have.

**TD;LR:** blew burp in dogs face, dog threw up in mine, i threw up in his but he was ok with that.

EDIT: ok ok poodles are a smart breed. Obviously pouncer didn't inherit any smarts from that side.

**EDIT:** front page. This isn't my finest moment, but i guess it'll do. I'd like to thank all those who made this possible. Nandos, pouncer, especially pouncer but mostly nandos. Thanks.

EDIT: for the love of god i know poodles are a smart breed now. Mines just got a real bad case of the dumb-shits. I guess he inherited it from his own

EDIT: thank you for the gold! If i had only known cross-species, two-way vomiting was the secret to gilding, i would have tried it sooner.",tifu
Update. My parents joined a new age cult and tried to drag me to a compound against my will.,"Since [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ccd4vh/fl_my_parents_have_joined_some_new_age_religion/) got popular and people still seem interested in my situation I thought I would give you guys a update on everything. It's been over a month and i'm sorry i kept you guys waiting. things were pretty crazy and my therapist said it probably wasn't the best idea to rant about it online till I felt ready. Well, now that i'm settled down a bit I feel like it might be good to get this off my chest anyway. Sorry if this disappoints you guys though as my dad says I should not include any personal details for fear of leaking my identity (so even though I know the group now I won't be naming them for fear of it getting back to me).

&#x200B;

So after I stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. My dad said not to go so I somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and I would come home that night. This plan didn't work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn't contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. It didn't take long before my mom caught on that I was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  My mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because I had been ""corrupted"" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound. My friends parents called the police and I called my dad and he got to talk to my mom. I'll leave it short and say this was a nightmare situation that almost ended with my mom being charged with  trespassing.

&#x200B;

My mom and dad argued on the phone for over 3 hours outside of my friends house. In the end my dad made it so I would not have to go with them but the only ""safe"" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. I stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. My mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and ""save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: My step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month I was coming no matter what. 

&#x200B;

After a week of this, everything changed. My mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. Me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. My sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. During this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  After this my mom called me one last time.

&#x200B;

She proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". All to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand I was being used by evil.""During these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn I was."" According to her I am a ""evil seed"" and that I not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". I also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. She told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. She ended by telling me that I was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". The last contact I know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

&#x200B;

At the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. I moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. Things are still pretty raw right now and I really don't feel like getting into the emotions I feel towards this. But I feel like at least updating this may be a start. Thank you everyone who gave advice and sent me kind messages on here offering help. I really do appreciate it :)",legaladvice
AITA for spiking my leftovers with Ghost Pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson,"So my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. 

Since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

I'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices. We actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. After he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and I get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. I hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by going to bed drunk.,"So last night I went out as I do every Saturday.
When I got there I met up with my friends and started the night with a couple of beers, but ended the night with a bit more than I could handle. After that I went straight home and instantly fell asleep on the couch as I was trying to lay down on it ""just to rest for a moment"".

I woke up around 5 today and my right arm felt a bit weird. It was cold and I couldn't move it at all.
At first I didn't panic at all because this has happened to me before because I sometimes sleep with my arm under my head. However today I slept with my arm under the side of my body ( I got a little over 100kg/220 lbs) with my back against the back-rest of the couch. After about 20 minutes of relaxing and massaging the arm with little to no signs of improvement I woke up my parents and after I explained my situation, my mom (who is a doctor) suggested we go to the hospital immediately.

During my 2 hour stay at the hospital the arm became significantly better as the time went on.
However my fingers and my wrist (not nearly as much as fingers but it still felt a bit off) movement were problematic. After getting some tests done on the arm nerves (which I hope I never do again) I waited for the results. A little over an hour passes and the doctor came back with the results. 

It appears that I have done damage to a nerve with my hip while I was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (I'm right handed) fingers . At first the doctor didn't know how I managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after I told him what I have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn't end up this badly.

Now I'm sitting at home writing this one-handed on my phone contemplating life just because of two beers too much.

TL;DR: Drunkenly fell asleep in a bad position and permanently damaged my arm nerves.",tifu

WIBTA if I ended my friendship with my best friend who is gay?,"Alright, hear me out, because I know how this sounds. I (22M) have been best friends with ""John"" (22M) for about 6 years. We always had a fairly affectionate relationship, but I never really thought much of it. About 5 months ago, John came out to me and I was completely supportive, but to be honest I started to consider some of his actions in a new light. 

For example, he tries to cuddle with me, hug me from behind, etc. I am completely supportive of him being gay, but some of these actions are making me uncomfortable. Also, he is pretty possessive and gets very upset if I ever spend time with a girl over him. He always says things like ""you don't care about me anymore!"", seemingly just to get me to say that I do. It's getting pretty exhausting, and frankly I am starting to wonder whether he has a crush on me based on his behaviour.

I told him about a month ago that I would appreciate if he reduced some of these behaviours, and he did not take it well. He was upset, and again it was about how I am trying to push him away. We haven't hung out quite as much since, but when we do there is just as much physical contact as before, even though that is one of the issues that I addressed.

I feel like I can't put up with this anymore. I want it to be clear that I have **no issue** with him being gay, but I would just prefer if these actions were not directed towards me.

My youngest brother and his girlfriend left their daughter with me a month ago and haven't been in contact since,"To make a long story short my youngest brother and his girlfriend are completely unfit to be parents, they can't even take care of themselves. Drug use combined with alcohol abuse and just their ages 19 and 20.

My parents had him later on in life, I'm 33 and my middle brother is 28 and he's 19. He pretty much has never cared about anyone except himself. Then he met his current girlfriend and managed to knock her up between being passed out from alcohol or various drugs. We were all worried about him and the kid so we got together as a family and got him an apartment, a car etc.

Well apparantly giving him all this newly discovered freedom of his first apartment and car made him do the opposite, he didn't grow up and apparently doesn't want to take care of his own daughter. A month ago he dropped her off while he was drunk, I hit him for driving drunk with my niece and told him if he ever does it again I won't stop. 

Well now it's a month later and he hasn't come back, hasn't called, hasn't done anything. I'm not complaining about having to watch my niece, I love her. I don't want her to go back to my brother, he's not in a place to take care of her or even himself.

How can I begin to move towards becoming her guardian without a whole lot of money and is there anyway to do it somewhat quietly? The family would flip out, everyone looks at him as a baby still but he's not. He's 19 and being stupid. I don't have a lot of spare money and having to buy all the stuff related to her has been and is expensive.

TIFU by stabbing my boyfriend with an EpiPen,"Okay, so obligatory 'this wasn't actually today' disclaimer, but this did happen on Saturday. However, because my boyfriend actively uses reddit and will most likely see this, I figured I'd do the respectful thing and wait two days before I posted this super flattering story.


Some important details to keep in mind:

1. my boyfriend is deathly allergic to peanuts and has been since he was just a wee child.

2. I'm a dumbass.



So, this past weekend marked our one-year anniversary, which is a huge feat in and of itself given detail #2 spelled out above. To celebrate, we decided to go out for a super fancy dinner -- the ol' OG Olive Garden.


Being a fourth-year student at university, I've gotten very used to not wearing makeup, but I decided to go all out for our anniversary dinner. I even went out and bought a lip-plumping gloss so my bf could pretend he was dating a Kardashian for the day instead of plain old u/kate-plus-self-hate. Supposedly, the gloss works by searing your lips until they are huge, red, numb, and possibly burned to the first degree -- needless to say, it was unpleasant to use but I still thought it was worth it.


Fast forward to my boyfriend picking me up and us detouring to an empty parking lot for a quick-ish makeout sesh. An hour later, we arrived at Olive Garden and started in on the unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks. We're maybe 15 minutes into dinner, and my bf starts complaining that his lips are tingling and that he feels kind of funny. I think nothing of it at first, but as we keep eating, he says the feeling was getting more intense and was spreading to his neck, abdomen, and *nervous glance* his nether regions.


My first thought was that he was hamming things up, but after a few minutes I could tell he wasn't faking anything. My next logical thought was that our food had come in contact with peanuts and that he was starting to have an allergic reaction. He agreed because he couldn't think of any other reason he would be experiencing the symptoms that he was.


At this point, I'm starting to freak out -- I don't want to be responsible for killing the only human who voluntarily spends time with me -- so I take my bf's keys and race out to his car. I knew he kept an emergency EpiPen in his glove box, so I fished that out, ran back into the restaurant, and jammed that fucker into his thigh.


Fast forwarding one more time, I flagged down our waiter to pay for our check, rushed my bf back out to his car, and drove like a maniac to the closest open urgent care facility. The practitioner there ran tests for his white blood cell counts and all of that fun shit, after which she told him that he's just fine and that none of their tests came back that he was having an allergic reaction. She asked him if he had come into contact with anything that might have been irritating his skin...


...and that's when my last two functioning brain cells decided to start working. The whole thing was my fault. The only possible explanation for the whole ordeal was that I got my probably-FDA-rejected lip plumping gloss all over my boyfriend's body.


My bf was less than enthused when we got home and I told him what I thought had happened. In fact, he made me throw the gloss out immediately. A few hours later, he (and my own lips) went back to normal, but at least this makes for an anniversary we won't forget...


TL;DR: I mistook my getting lip plumping gloss all over my boyfriend for him dying from a peanut allergy.",tifu
I called the police. Might have overreacted...,"So I'm heading from a small community to a larger town that's roughly 20 miles away. I set my cruise at 65 mph (approx 100 kmph) and just hang in my lane. I drive a large truck so I am not hotroding around... anyway... I large pickup passes me as if I'm sitting still. I notice it is a woman and she seemed agitated at something (me?). She slows down to the point that I have to get in the other lane (4 lane highway so effectively 2 lanes going my direction). As I approach her I notice she is jamming out, texting, and has what appears to be a 5-8 month old child...in the front seat. She then notices me and speeds up so that I don't pass her. I'm like ""cool. Ok, be crazy. I don't care."" So the remainder of the trip I'm following her. She continues to speed up/slow down and randomly change lanes and other wise drive erratically. So for the safety of myself, other drivers and most importantly that poor infant I called the police. I gave the friendly dispatcher the make, model, color and license plate info of the truck and she said they would send a unit out to investigate. Do you think I over reacted? My community is plagued by drugs and the erratic behavior screamed drugs or alcohol. I call the police for legitimate stuff but I couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong. 

Edit: Thank you for all who commented. I feel I didn't overreact within the context given. Some have mentioned that I didn't consider the consequences but that is why I even submitted this question to begin with. Its impossible to foresee all variables. Again thank you!

After retaining both lawyers we got in front of a judge, and we won! We now have full custody of all the children, he can only file any further actions by coming to Alberta to do so and we have full control of access to the children whom he can't remove from the province, if he wants to see them he has to come here.

Hi all. First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.

The night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""Dear \[Wife's name\],

I love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I'm doing my best to help you but the fact that you won't help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don't make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I'm ready to talk whenever you are.

With all my love,

\[My name\]""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her ""I love you so, so, much"", and started crying too. I honestly don't know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could've been 10 minutes, it could've been an hour, I didn't care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don't know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words ""I really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.""

I was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She's always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

We're not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

TIFU by accidentally ripping my butthole after lion king,"TIFU when

Ok so I got back from the movies seeing lion king and I needed to shower but I'm also in a funk so I wanted to smoke and drink coffee so I thought let's do a bath. 

Then I remembered I move out this week and I have like loads of excess bath products that it doesn't make sense for me to move so I should just dump them all in the tub to generate some fantastical bubble wonderland. 


Wrong, 3 half conditionors, a bottle of Irish spring and like a bunch of shampoo do not make a bubble bath but it's fine because it smells nice and I like the bubbles that are there. 


However, 


I went to get out and I stepped on the mat to drip for a second but I really wanted my coffee which was on the counter (dumb fuck me for not putting it closer to the tub) 

so anyway I take a small step on the shitty college apartment tile and fucking boom my well lubed body slid so hard and I did a split and slammed my foot into the door which would have really hurt if my fat ass didn't transform into a fucking bouncy ball launching me back up only to slide slideways this time knocking my cooter on the floor corner of the sink counter. 

At first I couldn't tell if I was bleeding but looks like it's just a poo stain and severe bruising from the sole fact my ass just bent in ways Gumby couldn't even do stamping a skid mark on the tile. 


Fuck me for trying to have a relaxing day 

TLDR I ripped my butthole and pooed on the floor after being depressed about the new lion king by slipping on the floor after a soppy bath

UPDATE

EDIT 1: I am a female.... logistics: I did a split with one leg in the front, other in the back (that's what did the ripping/bruising). Then I slid cooter first into the corner of the cabinet of my small bathroom, that's how this all happened.

My wife is done with sex and Im not ready to be celibate for the rest of my life... are we done?,"Since finishing having kids a few years ago, my (now 39yo) wife has not been interested in sex - for a long time she would go though the motions for my sake but grew to resent the ""chore"" more and more to the point where she would avoid me like the plague and we were fighting about it all the time. She swears its not me and that its not due to bad performance etc... she just doesnt want to.

We have done some reading and been to a councillor but it always ends up along the ""learning to be nicer to her so she'll get in the mood"" lines which is rubbish for our situation. No matter how happy, relaxed, rested, etc she is, the idea of sex is an instant agitation to her and she gets mad.

Essentially...
- if I try to get her in the mood, she gets pissed.
- if I am super nice and thoughtful etc, she is happy but nothing happens.
- if i do nothing, nothing happens.

Recently Ive stopped asking... and the fighting has stopped and she's happy... but Im dying inside.

Is our relationship over and we just need to cut the cord? Or is it normal and do i need to just come to terms with my sex life being over? I dont want an affair etc, I want my wife to want a physical relationship with me... is that too much to ask?

"UPDATE: My neighbors caused themselves to be landlocked, I posted here, it's resolved now","I posted here for advice a while back and received some excellent, some funny and some conflicting advice from all of you.  The overwhelming advice was to get a lawyer, which I did. I explained the situation and that I had posted here, as well as the many topics you all prompted me to read up on (which was very helpful).  While my lawyer seemed pleased with your advice to me, he also urged me to immediately stop publicly posting about the situation, which I did (and which I see from my many messages has disappointed all of you!)

First thing's first: everything worked out in my favor.

My wife was upset by the entire situation and especially concerned with our children, and she got involved as well.  She spoke with some friends who were able to get her in touch with the local city council. They could not explicitly do anything direct to help us but did get us in touch with some of the right people to discuss our situation.

One of the most important results from those connections was learning that the ""sheriff"" who we spoke to was actually a deputy who was acting on the sheriff's behalf. We were able to meet with the actual sheriff.  He did agree that we should be more open to compromise but was much more willing to admit that we had no immediate legal reason to do so, and no interest in forcing us to.

My lawyer made a key point of the fact (I use the term loosely) that if the neighbors require an easement to access their land, they should so so with the land they sold, and not with unrelated land. After a lot of back and forth (but no court proceedings, luckily) with the other party, their attention was refocused on the buyer of their land. Funny enough, it's a small world and I ended up meeting the buyer who was in my lawyer's office for a consultation with one of his partner's. He ended up needing to get a different lawyer (since I already had a lawyer from the firm, as I understand it) but we did keep in contact to some extent.

Now, some speculation: we believe that the reason the neighbors didn't bother us for a while was their finances; their lawyer was happy to keep pushing as long as he was getting paid, but when money ran dry he lost interest. 

Due (we believe) to those financial problems as well as their inability to find a quick solution, the neighbors ultimately moved into town and lived with family there for several months. The neighbor on the other side gave them one-time access with a moving truck. Their lawyer had been showing up with them but was gone at that time, which is another reason I suspect major money issues.

In the fall the situation picked up again, with contact from a new lawyer this time. This new lawyer requested a meeting with us (and our lawyer, of course). He requested that we consider buying their property to resolve the issue. We initially said no, they offered it to the owner on the other side, they said no, they sweetened the pot. Eventually the price was right and my wife and I had developed an interest in more land. We discussed terms, then decided against it, they went a little cheaper again, we purchased their land.

I nearly posted an update once the purchase was complete but there was an additional interesting detail that came out of the woodwork, and brought new legal questions. The neighbors had used their land and home as collateral for an informal loan and the person who lent to them wanted the property when they failed to repay him. He came after us.  The outcome of this was that they are the ones who failed their end of the contract, so his problem was with the neighbors, NOT with us.  This is definitely a sideline from the original situation but caused a delay in my ability to update.

As of today, my wife and I are out a substantial amount of money due to legal fees, which it turned out was not worth going after from the neighbors. There is also bad news in that the home on that property was essentially worth even less than we thought, and there were major issues beyond the land itself (septic tank failure, leaking oil tank).  Those expenses were slightly mitigated by insurance but we are out a good some.

We also had a hard time combining the plots, which was legally desirable to build anything that straddled the two property lines. However the plots are now combined into one large plot.

The good is that the neighbors are no longer an issue for us, and by this summer their property should be in good shape to use for a new project of our own. On one hand, I will say this: the little chunk of land was definitely not worth the time and stress involved in this process, nor the money. However, the outcome was positive for our family (for which there is no dollar value) and it's all over with now.

My sincere thanks to everyone who offered advice.  There are far too many of you to thank individually, but please know that I appreciated everyone's contributions and I hope you're all still around to read my much delayed resolution.",legaladvice
"Just like ""Don't shop, adopt!"" Movement for animals, there should be a huge movement of ""Don't reproduce, adopt"".","I feel we already have enough population. And it's not doing any good! Like lets be practical here. More than 70% of the world is struggling to meet their basic needs. 

I'm sure Our DNA is not that amazing that we need to preserve and pass on from generation to generation. It's not like if you don't pass on your genetics, world will loose something valuable. (grammar)

Not reproducing but adopting can bring a huge change in this world! 

Edit1: well this went out of proportion. Rip my inbox. 

Some clarification about my opinion. No I am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

Geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. And now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. So stop saying, hey I'm from Norway and I don't want to adopt an African child. Your country have zero orphanage?
It's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from African countries.

No I'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
I'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
But if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

And someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
Your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. This cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man! 

Edit 2: Getting a tons messages from the  people who were adopted. 
You guys are amazing, yes some of the replies on this post are harsh. But a lot of them are positive as well. We can always look on the brighter side. Love and respect to your parents who loved you and raised you like their own.

"UPDATE, AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister?","I'm back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

Well, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

I started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

Suffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

Well, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying ""You were put here to be her caretaker"". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

Today will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.

I won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.

So, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.

Late edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all.

We just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.

AITA for guessing a coworker's age correctly?,"Before I describe what happened, it is probably relevant to mention that, though not officially diagnosed, I exhibit some characteristics which might place me on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. (I grew up in a country where there is a paucity of understanding, even among medical professionals, about the disorder, so I never got diagnosed. I now live in the USA.)

This happened a few weeks ago, at the start of this month. My manager Anne was showing the new hire Jane around the office, and introducing her to everyone. Anne had ordered some cakes and drinks to celebrate Jane's hiring, and we all gathered around the dining table to break the ice with Jane.

I don't remember how we ever got to the topic, but at some point during the conversation, Anne excitedly asked, ""How old do y'all think Jane is? You'd NEVER guess her age!"" Initially, Jane objected to having her age become the subject of speculation, but eventually relented in good spirits. (She was laughing in what seemed to me like a good-natured manner while giving her consent.) My colleagues started taking turns to throw out numbers in the 21-25 range, which invited more giggles from Jane.

When it was my turn, I said, ""Mmm... You're probably around 35 years old, I guess?"" Immediately the joyous atmosphere dampened a little (even I could tell), but Jane quickly smiled and told me that I'd guessed correctly. I could infer that I'd made a faux pas, but fortunately everyone managed to move on quickly to other topics, and soon the conversation was flowing again.

At the end of the work day, Anne pulled me inside her office and told me (very gently and kindly) that I should have lied and told Jane that she looked younger than her actual age, because it would have made Jane feel more welcome in our company. Jane herself has not brought up the episode to me.

I don't like hurting people's feelings, but at the same time, I also don't like lying, unless it is absolutely necessary. In this case, I don't think it is a grave insult to be told that one looks 35 when one is in fact 35. AITA for not lying? Should I lie in similar situations in the future?

**EDIT:** Thank you, everyone, for your feedback. I have received lots of really great advice. Someone pointed out that I should have been able to infer that my coworkers were deliberately underestimating Jane's age and follow suit, but at that time I genuinely didn't think of that possibility. :-( I also genuinely didn't mean to use autism as an excuse, and I am sorry that it came across that way. I was trying to highlight that I have this particular shortcoming, so that people can give me suggestions on how to mitigate it. So, apologies again if it seemed like I was making excuses for myself. I moved to the USA early this year, and I am still trying to settle in. I have already made plans to get an official diagnosis later this year.

In the future, I will 1) decline to join in the game, or 2) borrow u/Sheephuddle's line ""I suspect you're too young to be worried about your age"", or 3) make light of the situation by making a patently absurd guess. That way I wouldn't have to lie, and I also wouldn't risk hurting anyone's feelings.",AmItheAsshole

"LPT: When at the beach, always beware the area where the waves don't crash. It often signals a rip current.","> Edit : Since this is getting some visibility, I want everyone to know that this post doesn't explain all the dangers of rip currents, nor does it depict how they exactly appear all the time. i just wanted to share a side of the danger that may be interesting to be careful about. The most important thing to keep in mind is to **not try to fight back against the current**, **swim sidewides to break out of it**. Rip currents are not always like the areas mentionned in the title. Also, I'm not the most knowledgeable on the subject, please read about it on specialised websites.

People often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. However the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.

It is way easier to see with [an image](http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). If you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.

AITA for sleeping over at my gfs 4 nights a week making her roommate uncomfortable and causing her to flip out?,"Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

Now, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

Liv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

Here's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

Their relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible. 

On an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

My mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together, that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. So AITA?",AmItheAsshole

UPDATE: My [34M] wife [28F] wants to name our baby after her dead ex-boyfriend,"[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bev4g9/my_34m_wife_28f_wants_to_name_our_baby_after_her/)

Hi all!

Wow - so, this post got a lot more traction than I expected. First of all, I want to thank all of you for your advices and showing your concerns not just for myself, but, for my wife. It means a lot.

Now, onto the update.

For Easter, we already had plans with her family to go to church and then have a BBQ at her sister's. Not wanting her family to see any tension, I saw this as a chance for her to HAVE to speak to me. As we're getting ready for church, I tell her that we need to talk about everything now. She agreed and sat down with me.

I did tell her that there is absolutely no way we're naming our baby after her ex (or, any of our kids, if we have even more). She agreed and apologized for acting irrational.

Also, I know a lot of you suggested that I get a paternity test. I know that I'm 100% the father. I didn't want anyone to get my anxiety up since, while it may seem rational, jumping into an extreme conclusion and making things worse. I thought it out, but, I still did ask if she was still in love with her ex and is she did cheat. She adamantly said no. She had already stopped loving him, even before they broke up. She tried to make the relationship work, but, she just wasn't in love with him anymore. She described him as not being a good person at all.

She apologized for making me feel that way.

I told her that I understand she's going through a lot of emotions right now and being pregnant doesn't help at all. But, I had to ask on why she would want to name our baby after him, even after all she has told me. 

She started to get choked up and was shaking. I told her that she could tell me. 

She confessed that when her and her ex broke up, the last thing she told him was that she wished he would fall off his bike and die. Also, the bike that he died riding on was a bike that she strongly suggested that he buy, even though it wasn't his first choice.

She also talked about how accidentally getting pregnant and her ex suddenly dying is a lot for her to handle. She wasn't expecting to be a mom so soon and her life is about to change when she really didn't want it too. She talked about how she thought we'd travel and that she'd continue racing her motorcycle. Now, she's not even sure if she'd be able to ride again. She actually thought she might be able to ride again once she had the baby, but, her ex's death reminded her how much of a risk it is. She doesn't want to risk her life when she has a family. She feels gutted. 

Regardless, she kept stressing out to me on how she wouldn't change a thing about her life now and that she's happy to be married to me and is going to be a mom. We're the best things that has ever happened to her.

Anxiety also runs in my wife's family. My wife gets intrusive thoughts about how her ex died too. It's so bad that she has a hard time sleeping sometimes. 

After discussing things, she decided that she'll be going into therapy.  She has her first appointment this week.

TLDR: Wife feels guilty about ex's death after persuading him to buy the motorcycle that he died on and telling him she wished that he'd fall off his bike and die. She keeps thinking about how he died. Wife also said that she's happy to be married and is going to be a mom, but, there's a lot going on and it's a lot. She's sad that she probably can't ride motorcycles anymore. Wife will go into therapy this week.",relationship_advice

AITA for going to my sister's dream school when she just got rejected?,"[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

So, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I'm not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...

My twin sister is the opposite of me. She's a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn't and still don't mind, it's true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn't is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don't know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

Well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn't get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

Well anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn't even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I'm a Cornellian. I got in. I just don't know how but I did. 

I really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she's been crying and solemn and sad. She's been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She's decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn't been herself. I haven't told our parents (I think they assumed I didn't get in because she didn't). 

Am I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it's Cornell. I couldn't in a million years imagine I'd get in. I've been researching obsessively about it and I can't shake the desire that if I don't go, I'll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it's a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. 

Am I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don't have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she's worked compared to me...

TLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn't. She's depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?

UPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. 

Well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn't I tell her earlier and she's so proud of me

But seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

I going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

Update 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn't know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update 

So after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:

> I'm sorry for how I reacted; please don't be mad. I'm so happy for you and your accomplishments. It's just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you're going to be where I wanted to be and I'm just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I'm sorry I'm ranting I just need more time

I'm not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don't. I don't deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I'm really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don't stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we're going to drift apart which would suck because we're best friends and I just don't want to lose my sister :(

Update 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). 

Then they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.

I stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.

I still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.

Update 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)",AmItheAsshole
AITA if I don't go to this job interview my cousin referenced me for,"So like 3 months ago when I was looking for a job my cousin suggested I work at the restaurant she works at. At the time I was like yeah that sounds cool, but had also just started working for doordash just to have income. However I actually enjoy doordash and delivering, plus I like the flexibility. So the place my cousin works at never called or replied to my resumes. 

However I just ran into her yesterday, 3 months later and after talking to her for a few minutes   (we ran into each other when she was walking into work) she said she'd tell them about me again. So she calls me yesterday and said they want me to interview today. I really had put no thought into taking the job or a new one at that cus I'm content with what I'm doing now. However I spontaneously said yes. But now the interview is in an hour and I honestly don't want to go. But my cousin gave me a reference and said she's excited to work with me but I just don't know how to feel or what to do. Truth is I really am not looking for another job and one has just been sprung upon me. I know I accepted the interview but, idk....

Edit: I'm on my way to the interview now. I know for my cousins reputation the least I can do is show up. I'm just going to wing it and give it some more thought so if they call back and offer the job I'll have a more thought out answer

Edit 2: the manager is 20 minutes late to the interview now

Edit 3: actually glad I went because the reason I was hesitant was because i thought they'd be hiring me as a host. However they said they're looking for delivery and were interested in my doordash experience and said they'd cover mileage, include tips, and guarantee pay if there are no deliveries. That's more than I have with doordash so I actually am interested in this position now. They set me up for another interview. Thank you to everyone here who called me an asshole and made me feel bad so I'd get my ass to the interview. Actually worked out in my favor.

last edit: it was definitely an interesting day. Initially when I posted this, within the first 3 minutes about 5 people said I was the asshole. That made me feel pretty bad so I went to go to the interview 10 minutes after posting. Edit 1 occurred 10 minutes after the post, edit 2 about 20-30 minutes after edit1, then edit3 about 45 minutes after. Glad you all enjoyed the read.",AmItheAsshole

WIBTA (45/m)for proving my friendship even if it costs my buddy his marriage?,"Here we go - I have been in a group of friends (husbands, wives, kids) for almost 20 years.  We started out as a neighborhood group and have grown bigger as our friendships have evolved and most of us have moved out of the original subdivision.  We are adults 40-50 years old.  The men play golf most every weekend and one evening during the week.  Holidays and birthdays are big get-togethers with sometimes 50 people. I am currently the only unmarried person in the group (divorced in 2011).  This is the sticky part.

&#x200B;

About 7-8 months ago, one of the women in the group named Cindy, started coming on to me.  While flattered, I would never do anything as I like her husband Mike and have know her kids since they were preschoolers.  It seemed like a little harmless flirting at first, but then it moved into some very direct propositioning.  She had her reasons for wanting to become sexually involved and put a mild bit of pressure on me to begin an affair with her.  One of the ways she pressured me was to text me racy pics and those soon moved to x-rated pics and videos.  It really put me in an awkward spot and I told her that.  My response was that I found her attractive, but she was strictly off limits to me since she was married.  Even if I didn't know her husband - I still would not have done anything.  And I didn't.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I found out that I had missed a few golf days and I just chalked it up to bad timing.  Well....there was a huge 4th get together and I asked around about it and it seemed no one would own up to me not being invited.    Apparently, there have been other events that I didn't know about and I wasn't invited there either. I finally got some answers last night when I ran into a friend and her daughter at the grocery store.  She would barely look at me when I spoke to her and her teenage daughter spilled the beans.  Cindy was caught with the racy pics on her phone and ""confessed"" to Mike that I had put her up to it and was pressuring *her* to have an affair.  Needless to say, I was stunned at this revelation.  I thanked her for her honesty and went home and thought about it for a long time.

&#x200B;

I have saved every single text and pic.  Last night I printed them all out.  If I showed Mike 10% of what she said to me and what she sent to me - he might leave her.  Meanwhile - I am pushed out of my friend group for doing what I thought was right.  I told her at the beginning that this was heading down a road of hurt - but when she got to the painful part, she pushed me under the bus.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UPDATE:  I reached out to Mike and he texted me that he never wants to see or talk to me ever again.  Some of you have suggested that I reach out to a leader in the group and I have done that - I will be meeting with another couple tonight.  She is a gossip, so anything I show her or tell her will be public knowledge two hours after I leave their house.  You get what you get.

&#x200B;

UPDATE #2: It turns out that the whole group knows nothing, just a few.  Mike and Cindy filed for divorce in January due to his infidelities and tried to keep it private.  From my end, everything is good.  It turns out that both or them are assholes.",AmItheAsshole

"My college says if I miss class to testify at my assault trial, they'll drop me from my classes (UPDATE)","OP here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9gdico/my_college_says_if_i_miss_class_to_testify_at_my/?st=JN056NAS&sh=90aa7f5f

Thanks to everyone's terrific advice, I got my university's ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to RAINN) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

Within a day of meeting with the school's general counsel, my attorney and I were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

One of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration's decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching I am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

Between my professors' incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting I was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (I'll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

The ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward. 

Thank you everyone here who took time to give me such helpful advice. I appreciate all of you! ",legaladvice

TIFU by giving an alternative meaning to a (previously) suicidal girl's tattoo.,"Disclaimer: This actually happened several years ago, but I do still feel really bad.

I was out on a date with a girl and things were going well despite me being a nervous wreck. We got to talking and she admitted she had depression and at one point was even suicidal, but was proud of herself for getting past that chapter of her life. She then shows me her semi-colon tattoo on her wrist and explains the significance - that it means the sentence could have ended there, but the author decided to add more. It's all very sweet and heartfelt. Now, I in no way have any issues with mental illness and still feel super guilty about this to this day, but me with a perpetual foot-in-the-mouth syndrome say ""You know in programming it means end"".

She doesn't say anything.

I don't say anything.

Good Morning, guys. This is an uplifting update. 
 
First of all, I'd like to thank all of you guys for such an overwhelming response.I'm glad that there are people who would spend time from their busy life to help a random stranger on Internet. :) 
 
So, After reading all of advises here and carefully discussing this matter with my cousin, we made a nasty plan. Yesterday night that squatter girl went outside to grab some dinner with her bf. Me and my cousin carefully packed all of her stuffs in her three bag left in in our front porch and locked ourselves in house. We also looked over her stuffs from window to make sure no one steals it. 
 
Our wait was over after 2 hours when girl returned. She figured it out and started pounding at our door, yelling loudly to open door, you know typical squatter drama. We told her to go fuck off and we won't open the door. So, finally after 30 minutes of constant drama, she dared to call cops. I was nervous how it would turn out. 
 
Cops arrived. Fortunately these were different ones than previous night. First they listened to her side. Then they came to me. I explicitly told them that I was sole owner of house and never allowed girl to stay more than 1 night. She was not only trespassing but also living in my house illegally without my permission. Bitch kept saying I had given permission to stay there indefinitely and now kicking her out. Officer said she has any proof of that? She claimed she had some message which accidentally got deleted. 
  
Now the best part, Officer then asked her for an ID. She gave ID. Officer verified it over Radio. Suddenly, they told him this bitch had a failure to appear warrant for months old shoplifting case. Stupid lady was arrested immediately. His stuffs were send to friend's house. Officer said that I don't need to worry and they'll take care of her. I do not require any further action. 
  
So, Finally I'm relived from that squatter and bitch is behind bars. What a justice boner! 
 
All's well that ends well. :)

Let me preface this by saying it has been a long day and my brain is malfunctioning a bit.

Anyway, I was walking down the street on my lunch break when I saw a woman wearing really cool shoes. After months of boots, it's nice to see some cool sandals, amirite?  I also noticed, by looking at her ankles, that she had really nice milky white skin. I'm trying a new thing where I attempt to compliment one person every day (because I'm an introvert with mental health issues, and the internet says this will help). So, I decided this was my moment.

They started screaming, crying, and breaking things. They were talking about how they wish they never got married. I'm used to this, but I'd finally had enough.

I went downstairs and said something along the lines of ""shut up! I'm trying to sleep! I don't care if you get a divorce! It's better than having to listen to you guys scream and cry like children every single day! So yeah, go ahead and get a divorce.

My roommate went behind my back and got an ESA. My insurance has gone up drastically. What can I legally do to get her and/or this dog out of my house.,"For a bit of background; I live in the USA. Connecticut specifically. (Not sure if itll make a difference) boyfriend and I own our home. We rented out a room to a female friend. Our lease came with the stipulation of absolutely no dogs allowed, but other pets are welcome. 

The exact wording of the clause is ""Absolutely no dogs other than [REDACTED my name]' allowed in the home. Other animals including but not limited to cats, birds, and reptiles are welcome with proof of current vaccines if applicable""

 Its a 6 month lease. This is the only property we own. 

She went and got papers from her doctor for an ESA and adopted a pitbull. This is going to cause my homeowners insurance to SKYROCKET due to the breed. This dog has already shown aggression towards my husky, including biting her. The lawyer I spoke to told me there was nothing I could do about it, so I came here to ask. What can I do about this? We cant afford for our homeowners insurance to raise drastically, nor do I want my dog, or the pitbull, hurt. 

I would have worked with her if she had discussed it with me, and modified the lease to allow a small dog, or any breed that wouldnt cause my insurance to rise drastically.

TIFU because of my boyfriend's butt. NSFW,"So if you can't tell from my username, I am a huge fan of the booty. Specifically, I am a fan of the male buttocks. Always have been. Always will be. And it just so happens my bf has a rocking badonkadonk.

Any we're cuddling on Saturday morning like couples do, and I get around to groping his butt. Poking, squeezing, light slapping, you get the picture. Anyway eventually I get the bright idea to faceplant into his left butt cheek.

Unfortunately in my ass molestation induced horniness, I miscalculated his cushion for the pushin relative to my velocity.

I smacked nose first into his butt so hard I went straight through to his hip bone. Cue me running to the bathroom with an epic ass induced nosebleed. My boyfriend at this point, sighing at my perpetual clumsiness, decided to call it a morning to get tea. Thus ended our cuddle session for the day.

Edit: Buttocks not buttOX. There is not a draft animal living in his pants.

I [29M] found my girlfriend [32F] has a soft strap-on dildo that she's been hiding from me. I think she knows I found it. What do I do?,"Update: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cugm1i/update_i_29m_found_my_girlfriend_32f_has_a_soft/?

TL;DR: Looked in her clothes drawer. Expected to find a uniform shirt. Found a floppy dong.

We've been dating for four years, moved in together a few months ago.

We each keep our clothes in our own separate chests of drawers, which helps us to avoid mix-ups on clothing. We can usually almost fit each other's sizes, though her stuff tends to be tight on me and my stuff tends to be tentlike on her. We work the same job, on occasionally differing shifts, and while I've always realised her shirt is too tight to be the right one before accidentally wearing it into work, she has occasionally worn my tents on shift  without realising.

Anyway, this happened yesterday. I had to leave for work in a few minutes (she'd already been on shift for a few hours), and there was no sign of any of my uniform shirts. She hadn't been wearing it when I left, so I figured it might have been put away with her things.

I was going through the drawer she keeps her shirts in... and then suddenly I felt something weirdly squishy. I didn't even think, I just pulled it out. And there it was, wrapped up in a little crop top: The Dong. Three inches at most, Caucasian-coloured, and floppier than a disk.

I kinda stared for a bit. It was in a harness, so my first thought was to expect a talk about enhancing our love life with the joys of pegging. (Which would surprise me from her? She's barely a sexual person at all. But I'd consider it!) But this thing was _soft_. Fully flaccid. No way you'd be able to get that into my puckered behind, not without a LOT of uncomfortable shoving.

So I couldn't help wondering, what was this thing for? I think she'd have the same issues fitting it into herself, and the harness made me think she'd be wearing it. Does she just stroll around wearing it, acting cocky? Is she experiencing the joys of helicoptering? Honestly, I'd probably get a cock to helicopter with if I were a girl, so I _completely_ understand.

Eventually I stopped staring in wonderment and put the floppy thing away so I could find a damn shirt. Eventually had to take a dive into the dirty washing basket, which I'm not proud of. We overlapped by about an hour at work, but we work in different sections, so had no time for much more than ""hi""/""bye"" as we passed each other. Certainly no mention of floppydong.

Like a flaccid phallus to the face, a realisation hit me a couple of hours in. In my hurry, I hadn't wrapped the dick up in the crop top again. Nor had I buried it back under the mountains of clothes concealing it. It had simply lain bare on the surface, making it clear to every Dick, Tom and Harry that someone had made the dickscovery.

I felt like I'd committed a cardinal sin doing this. We never established that each other's drawers were off-limits, but ""de facto"" they were, and now I'd crossed a line by uncovering something she'd been keeping a secret.

It gets worse: every day when she gets home from work and I'm not around, she messages me about how her day was. Funny things, shitty customers, how hard or stressful the workload was today. Just anything. She's 100% consistent about it, and I always look forward to receiving it...

... but today, she sent just one message.

""got home""

That's all, folks.

She'd been really happy when I saw her on my way in and her way out. Something must have happened. Either her commute home really sucked, or she knows I've found her secret.

She was asleep when I got back (I was on the overnight shift). I'm here sorta panicking and writing this all out and making dick jokes.

I really never thought I'd be using this forum, but I need help here. I want her to know that this is okay, whether it's a sex toy or a helicoptering toy or whatever. I respect her privacy, and her use of this, and I want her to know that she doesn't have to hide things like this. But as I said, she's really not much of a sexual person. At least, she's rarely very sexual with me, and doesn't seem to enjoy sex too much. Which is fine! But if she owns something like this, maybe she's just deeply ashamed, and that'd be a lot to work through.

Part of me wants to pretend this never happened, pretend it just stayed hidden. Hell, maybe she actually doesn't know I found it, and that message was just some unrelated bad mood. But I don't think I can really just ignore the consequences now. Gotta face them.

TIFU While talking dirty to my gf,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So a little background: My current gf and I have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. Before her I was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. Obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and I'm learning everything for the first time. Long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. I said I was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside I knew that I had no idea what I would be doing and would kind of be winging it. Last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. So we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. She's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.
She kind of rambled for a bit, and I was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. The rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than I normally do. This is all new territory for me, but I'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like Christopher Columbus, and she's what I think is India. So I decide to talk dirty. Her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, I figure this is the perfect time to strike. And that's when I cleverly decided to ask if I make her ""moister than an oyster"". 

Her face fell. It's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. I went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. I've been wondering how I could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. We approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. I don't think I'll be redeeming myself anytime soon. 

TLDR: I decided to be sexy and asked my gf if I made her moister than an oyster. She doesn't think oysters are sexy.",tifu

In our home state (Texas) after talking to an abortion clinic it seems like they require one parent to be notified and consented. Our parents do not know about the pregnancy and will not consent, not in a million years.

So I guess the question is how much of a legal trouble would we be in if I took her to an abortion clinic in New Mexico? Which doesn't seem to require parental consent or notification. There is one less than two hours away, I can take her and being her back the same day, tell our parents that we were hanging at my place or went to a zoo or something.

TIFU by accidentally complimenting a patients penis,"This happened yesterday and Im still horrified and laughing about it. Im an ultrasound tech. I had a patient come in for an ultrasound because he has some swelling in one of his testicles. The normal procedure is I leave the room, he takes off his pants and underwear and lays on the exam table and covers up with a sheet. I come back in the room and place a towel over his groin while pulling down the sheet. He remains covered. I place another towel over his legs below the testicles. This keeps only the testicles exposed during the procedure. 


Everything good so far. The scan involves checking each testicle as well as the surrounding area. For the most part this is just place and, get image, repeat. As Im working, I can see he is slightly uncomfortable and keeps moving. It's not uncommon for men to get an erection. Typically I ignore it but this guy is shifting enough that Im not able to get images. I say ""Don't worry about it. It's normal but I need you to hold still.""


He settles down and I continue. The towel is bulging enough that I can tell he still has the erection. I need images of the urethra so I am checking his shaft also. Yep still hard. OK so this guy is hot! I have an attractive man laying on the table with no pants and an erection covered by nothing more than a bulging towel while my hand is rubbing a wand along the length of his erection. No big deal Im a professional. I finish and start to put the machine away but between his moving and my nervousness I don't realize that the cord is under the edge of the towel. The towel starts to slide off as I pull so I reach down to stop it. Im reaching between the bed and the ultrasound machine and lose my balance. I have a hold of the towel as I start to fall and rip it off. A blob of what I hope is lube from the ultrasound catapults up and hits me in the face as Im bent over. Not thinking, I use the towel that is already in my hand to wipe myself off. As Im wiping my face on this guy's loin cloth I get a good view of him. After a moment I realize that Im just staring at his extremely large and very erect penis. He is completely exposed but afraid to cover himself because I already got onto him for moving earlier. I start to apologize. I meant to say something along the lines of ""oh my God Im so sorry"". Instead what comes out is ""wow impressive"". I mentioned Im professional right?


I lay the towel back over him, fumble to put the machine away and tell him to get dressed and open the door when he is done. He tries to tell me it's no big deal when he was leaving but I was so embarrassed that I couldn't even make eye contact.


Edit: I'm not sure why this became so popular. There is a lot of mix between 'you made his day' and 'you should be fired'. I admit it was a mistake and I didn't intend to say something. I hope I didn't make him uncomfortable with my comment. I reported it to my supervisor though and was (am) willing to accept the consequences. I admit it was a mistake on my part. Yes I'm female. No I wasn't trying to brag that women get away with abuse. Yes I'm human and make mistakes. Yes I apologized to the man several times for both my comment and for my clumsiness. He wasn't upset when he left the office but if he files a complaint then I will understand and I will live with it. No I did not ask him out. No I will not call him from his file. I have to get ready for work now. I will either reply to more comments or delete this post entirely later. I wasn't trying to create unwanted attention for this man or make light of the situation. I was still horrified by it when I posted so thank you to those that supported me because you helped me relax over the situation but I don't consider that permission to do it again. Thank you strangers for the gold/silver/platinum.


Edit2: Quick update over lunch break because this has taken off so much. I expected 20 people to read it and along. My supervisor pulled me off one of my appointments earlier and called me into his office where other hospital personnel were waiting. I knew what was coming next. After I reported the incident my supervisor filed a report. This kicked off a whole process which included someone reaching out to the patient proactively for damage control. The good news is that the guy isn't upset. He had no clue why they were calling him and they said he started laughing when they explained. He was apparently apologizing to them and thought it was a waste of their time. He said and this is the best part that if he has to come back he hopes I'll be there. :) The bad part is I had to sign some forms for the hospital and was reminded that I need to be more careful. I feel I got lucky because this could have been much worse.

AITA for subjecting my boyfriend to my nakedess?,"I (32F) live with my boyfriend (35M) of 5 years. We live together in an awkwardly shaped apartment with a long, narrow living room and a tiny bedroom. As a result, our dresser is in the living room.

After work, I like to come home, greet my boyfriend who's usually relaxing on the couch, and change into my gym clothes. While I'm changing in the living room, we usually talk about our day. Well today, I started telling him about an annoying co-worker while I was topless. Out of nowhere, he abruptly stops me and curtly says, ""don't talk to me when you're naked"". I was really taken aback by this. Embarrassed, I went into the bedroom to dress in peace.

Angrily, I came out and asked my boyfriend why he suddenly had a problem with me being naked. Before I get into his reasoning, I will admit that I am naked quite a bit. For instance, after I shower I like to do a naked Kermit style dance to dry off in front of him. Anyway, his discomfort is that seeing me naked all the time makes it less special when we have sex. He even mentioned that this issue came up in Seinfeld and that Jerry would side with him. I don't know about this, I feel like I have a right to be naked, but I don't want him to feel uncomfortable either.

Anyway, should I let my fur flag fly or AITA??

UPDATE: Before I dive in, you guys really came through with the solid advice! Thank you! Ok, so after this incident I decided to cool off and go to the gym. When I got home my boyfriend sheepishly greeted me. I coldly said ""hi"" and sat on the couch to play on my phone. While I'm sitting, he walks over to me and without saying a single word, begins to start stripping! He gets butt naked, picks up my free weights and starts doing lunges, squats, bicep curls, you name it! I watched him in silence until we both couldn't take it anymore and started laughing. He then apologized, saying he doesn't have a problem with my nudity, he just doesn't like to have prolonged conversations when I'm naked. I understand where he's coming from, so we agreed that any conversation longer than 5 minutes will require a shirt. Tough, but fair.

Thank you again for your helpful comments! They were really thoughtful and made me think deeper about how I was making him uncomfortable. In terms of saying that me being naked all the time makes sex less special, he said it was a dumb comment that he only said in anger. I accept this.

I'm also a bit obsessed with all the Seinfeld comments. Jerry is absolutely an asshole and using him to argue your point is hilarious. Now Kramer on the other hand...

And thank you to everyone who supports my Kermit dance! I will confidently dance dry after my shower tonight. But for no longer than 5 minutes. I know the rules.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by forgetting to lock the bathroom door.,"Oh boy how I wish this had happened at home. I'm sat on the shitter in one of my university's study spaces too embarrassed to leave. This just happened 5 minutes ago.


So me, being a man of somewhat regular bowel movements, stood up and headed for the toilet about ten minutes ago. Both of the unisex toilets were locked so I found myself a seat for a minute whilst I waited.

Not long after one became available and I headed in, only to find a lot of toilet roll all over the floor and the tap still running. Being the good sort I am, I tutted to myself, bent down and cleared away the paper and turned the tap off.

This is where I fucked up.

I then dropped trou, rotated through 180° and popped a squat. I happily dropped logs for a few minutes, browsing Reddit as I did so (I am a man of culture) and thinking to myself rather proudly that it was definitely one of the smelliest shits I've produced for a while (okay, not that cultured).

Unbeknownst to my forgetful self, I had totally failed to lock the door. Enter poor girl, who sees an unlocked door and heads right for it. The first I know is when the  handle creaks down and the door swings open.

For a good two seconds this girl stares at me and I stare back, neither of us really knowing what to do in such a situation, when the smell obviously hits her and she mumbles a quickfire apology and turns tail for the hills.

AITA for specifically ordering food my wife hates so I don't have to share?,"Yeah so I'm basically Joey from Friends before anyone states the obvious. I really really hate sharing food when I order out at restaurants or takeout. I always order just enough for myself so when someone grazes off my plate it makes me unreasonably upset. 

So my wife is a TERRIBLE food snatcher. She always says she's not that hungry and orders a small side or nothing at all, then slowly devours the food I've ordered. So many times I've ordered steak and fries just to end up competitively eating fries with her as we both race to get the last fry. I ask her to order her own stuff but she'll say she's not that hungry or my food looks better, etc. 

Anyways in the past year I've found a good trick where I simply order dishes with one ingredient she hates (cilantro, anchovies, carrots, or chilies) and she won't touch any of it. Recently some family members discovered I do this and called me a massive asshole. They called me childish for not sharing food with a spouse but honestly I'm just sick of not being able to eat a whole meal. AITA?

**Edit**: To those asking if I've told her to stop, I do, all the time, but it's honestly worse because then she sits there and eyes my food sadly. Or she'll sigh and push her own plate around and ask, sadly ""so how's your food? It looks really good..."" Or she waits until I'm taking a break to ask me multiple times if I've finished and if she could now have a bite, in the saddest voice possible like she's begging for scraps. It just feels super disconcerting when someone is so focused on me eating my meal.

I like just getting something she has no interest in cause then I can eat in peace, and that usually forces her to order something else for herself as well.",AmItheAsshole

"[Update] A bit late, but here's my update","[This was my original inquiry](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4yj8ar/advice_for_presenting_evidence_in_a_minor_traffic/)


My court date was actually last November so I'm quite late on the update, just had it on my check-list until now. 


Basically I went to court and claimed not guilty. They gave me a reduced fine and said it was a one-time offer. I said not guilty. They gave me a follow-up court date, which was the one in November. 


On that day, my ticketing officer did show up. At first, some of the court people were asking me if I was absolutely sure that I wanted to fight the ticket and if I was open to claiming nolo claim with a reduced rate. This was the same reduced fine that they presented me on my first court date, where they said it was a one-time offer. I said no and asked what the possible fines were if I was found guilty. The lady quoted me the maximum, which was like a **lot** of jail time and like $2,000 in fines or something. I still claimed not guilty. In hindsight I feel like she was trying to scare me into going nolo? Not sure. 


The court lawyer lady (not sure what she's called now that it has been so long) asked him questions to help him present his case on my ticket. Very reminiscent of TV court rooms, confirming dates, times, and details. 


When I presented the evidence, I didn't allude to my background or anything, as per suggestion from /r/legaladvice. Basically I just said: 



- The officer providing ground guidance for vehicles was unclear in his instructions

- There were multiple people ticketed for the same turn at the intersection

- The ticketing officer was not present or in the vicinity when the other officer was providing ground guidance



I did not sound very... er.... lawyer-y, but I didn't use slang, curse words, or anything like that. I was basically speaking like I was presenting a PhD thesis. The judge confirmed that the officer providing ground guidance was not present and that the ticketing officer did not see the other officer guide traffic. He then said at that point, it's basically a ""he said, she said"" situation and he would rule in my favor because the police side lacked evidence to prove that there wasn't any bad guidance from the other cop. 


Just wanted to thank you guys. Your advice helped a lot and to be frank, I feel like a basic understanding of law should be taught in school because in hindsight, I feel like they were trying to intimidate me several times into a nolo claim and paying the fine. ",legaladvice

I ended up calling and essentially saying that those that contributed nothing or little should not be shamed with a number game sent in the mail. If anything you should be sending a letter to those that contributed nothing letting them know that the church has resources available and that they will always be welcomed to contribute spiritually.

AITA for wanting another child?,"Throwaway because I'm sure some people will find this controversial and I don't want it tied to my main.

When my wife and I got married we agreed that we would have 2 kids unless both were girls, then we'd have a 3rd to try for a boy. I'm a guy's guy and I grew up with only brothers so I feel strongly that I want a son to bond with. That's not to say that I don't love my daughter equally. I just want to raise someone to follow in my footsteps with sports and girls and stuff. After some convincing, my wife agreed to this but said that if the 3rd kid was a girl, we'd stop trying. Anyway, we ended up having one boy (8 years old) and one girl (5 years old). This background is important because you need to know that having a 3rd kid was something that was on the table.

Last month, our son told us that he likes boys. This is totally fine, I'm not a homophobe, but I'm starting to feel like I want to have a 3rd kid so we can try to have a straight boy.

"AITA - I don't care for my family as much since they plan on leaving everything of value to my brother, because he's a man","Let me just start off with ""it's not about the money"". This is just the final straw, at least from my perspective.

I'm my family's first born, but I'm a girl. My brother is a boy, and we both hail from a patriarchal (european, christian) family, where it's expected that women should both study, find a job, marry, have kids, but also not be stingy over their share of inheritance, that usually goes to their brothers.

Which is ok, I have my own life, I'm a grown up person and I don't rely financially on my family, nor do I need anything from them. It still kinda hurts.

It began when I was 7 or 8, when I had to do choirs that my brother was excused from because he was a boy. His driving lessons were paid for, mine weren't. When my father planned on getting remarried (he divorced my mother), he told me he can't have two women living under the same roof and that I should move out, so his wife could move in. So I did move out. Now, I'm in my 20s, I don't live with them anymore, but when I come over, my grandpa and grandma ask me to iron my brother's shirts, vacuum the place, wash the dishes. When I ask them why can't my brother do it (he lives with them), they say: ""He's a man"". As if having a penis makes you physically incapable of ironing your own damn clothes. I sometimes do some of this stuff, but only because my grandma is old and I can't watch her being acting as a house slave for every male in my family.

From their perspective, I'm probably selfish and I understand that. They paid for my education, cared for me when I was sick, tried to minimize the traumas I had in my life from things irrelevant to this story, and they loved me in their own way,  They do love me and they do care for me. Things aren't that black and white. I love my brother, we're close and we'd die for each other, if we had to. I love the rest of my family as well (some more than others).

This isn't a big thing since I don't rely financially on them and I don't live with them, but these little things carve themselves into the picture you have of your family.

EDIT: Somebody told me to edit the post to clarify my brother's stance. He wants to share the inheritance with me and he had his share of problems with my family, just like I did, just not regarding the inheritance. He's a true bro.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for getting a waxer fired from her job for snickering at my junk?,"This morning I went to get waxed because I have a date with someone tonight. Not planning on having sex but if it happens it happens and I would wanna be prepared.

I had to wait an entire hour because apparently only one waxer knows how to wax testicles and peen, and I was also kinda pisses that they charge different prices for men... anyways

So I assumed the usual Grabbing my legs under the knee pose for the waxer to do the needful... and she snickered. Yes, a snorting laugh with nasal flaring and mouth covering. 

I asked what she was laughing at and she said ""oh just your... uhh... undies... cause of the pattern"" (which was a pretty plain checkered pattern so how could that be funny?)

I should probably also explain that I have been self conscious about my size since as far as I can remember. Basically my circumcision was botched as a child and as a result I have an abnormally curved penis with visible scarring and to this day, pain during intercourse.

So this is why I believe that she was laughing at my genitals.

Am I the asshole for complaining and getting her fired because I found her reaction hurtful and insulting?

Are there areas in America that are so dangerous that Google hasn't driven the street view car down them?,"I get it guys, turns out there IS such a thing as a stupid question. And apparently it's ""would anyone rob someone that's driving a car with a giant 360 degree camera on it"".

Not gonna lie though, it's been interesting seeing how many of you have zero idea of how bad some neighborhoods are in America and anyone who does must ""get all their information from Fox News"". I guess when y'all google ""deadly carjacking"" or even ""carjacking"" google just shows an error message.

I'm also done trying to argue with people about it because they went down a bad neighborhood once and it was fine. It's been fun guys, have a good one.

A final edit for anyone who lives in a city that I can find an article listing the most dangerous areas there that disagrees with me regarding how dangerous neighborhoods can be. If you drive down the street of my choosing going the speed limit and upload a video of it as proof, I'll donate $10 to the charity of your choice (with a max of $100). Just comment on this post or private message me, and I'll add your username up here. Once you upload the video I'll also upload it as proof of me being wrong about violence happening to random passersby, and proof of the donation.

Edit: it's going to need to be after 5 pm as well (if it's like 4:45 I'm not going to split hairs though. I'm not trying to make people go after dark because that would be stacking the deck a little much).

"Divorcing, turns out we were never legally married, husband says I don't have rights to our property OR our kids (PA)","Last week I asked my husband for a divorce. He countered by announcing that we were never actually married in the first place. We were married in 2007 by his family priest, who is a close friend of his mother's. I never questioned the credentials of the priest because why would I? 

Turns out that the priest was fully defrocked shortly before our marriage, for reasons no one will share with me. My husband says that at the time he was appealing the loss of his priesthood, but ""it didn't stick"". He (my husband) seems to have known the whole time that our marriage wasn't legal, looking at it as a potential out just in case, but he won't confirm this either way (I'm guessing if he did know it was some kind of fraud). My mother in law tearfully confirmed the situation, saying she didn't think it was a big deal at the time because she assumed the appeal would go through. I don't have any reason to doubt her about any of this. 

My husband is now saying that because we aren't really married, I don't have any equity in our house or rights to our things. Worst of all, since he insisted on getting paternity tests on our kids (7 & 4) as infants, HE has parental rights, but not me, since there isn't any proof that I'm their mom. Obviously I'm on their birth certificate but he says that doesn't mean anything because he has DNA proof and I don't. I don't *really* believe this, but I know that unmarried parents don't necessarily have rights without going through the courts so I wanted to check. 

My husband says that he's consulted with a lawyer and that this is just like a ""regular breakup"". He's given me 30 days notice to leave our house since he owned it outright before our ""marriage""/union/whatever. Obviously I have an appointment with my own attorney on Friday, but my head is going to be going a million miles an hour till then so I guess I'm just looking for some...info? Confirmation of his bluffs? Anything would be appreciated.

Tl;dr: Priest who ""married"" my husband and me was defrocked before our ceremony and didn't legally marry us. Husband says this means I have no rights to our property or kids. Looking for more information. ",legaladvice

[Netherlands] UPDATE + THANK YOU! Boss sexually assaulted me. You guys helped me. Yesterday he was convicted.,"Hi all,

I hope it's ok to post this here. I just want to say a big **THANK YOU** to this community. 

I can't find my original post, since I deleted my older account, but more than a year ago I posted on here asking for advice about sexual harassment during a job interview and some of you told me that what I had described was more than harassment, that it was assault. By that time I had already taken the job, for many reasons I won't go into and thinking that something bad couldn't possibly happen again - don't judge, the therapists and social workers explained how my reaction was in fact normal. Trouble is the man sexually assaulted me again, and also hit me.

Now, that's where you guys come in: commenters on here had suggested I talk to my boss about all that happened and tell him what he did was not OK, but said I should do this all **in writing**, which *I did*. Lo and behold, since the police refused to talk to the witnesses who were present (I couldn't believe it either), **it was the written messages *you* suggested I write that proved my case**! So THANK YOU!

But wait! There's more! After the incidents I was broken and couldn't work for 6 months. During that time, and because of the comments on here + the insane amounts of alcohol I found myself consuming, I did some research online and came across various resources for victims of sexual assault, which helped me rebuild enough of my dignity to keep going (rebuilding myself is an ongoing process). But my gut told me to press charges and so I did, and check this: the man was taken to court. Turned out he had raped another woman not a year before he assaulted me, and had I not pressed charges he wouldn't have been taken to court unless he assaulted someone else and *they* decided to press charges. So I think it's not presumptuous to thank you on behalf of the other woman.

As for the verdict, given everything I've seen here in the Netherlands, I wasn't expecting much but I felt I'd won a battle on behalf of victims everywhere simply by having my case taken seriously, and another when I learned he was going to be taken to court. The fact that he was found guilty comes as a bonus, even if his punishment is a couple week's community service. Yup, that's it, a little community service.

Again THANK YOU for your help!!!",legaladvice

My (21M) girlfriend (22F) got into a wheelchair. Don't know if we're compatible anymore.,"I know the title is horrible and everyone is going to call me an asshole but this is the truth. She got into a bad accident 3 months ago and is now in a wheelchair, presumably for the rest of her life. She's handling it like a champ. We've cried together a lot, but she's the most positive person I know. Always keeps her head up even after this. And I love her immensely, we are highschool sweethearts been together for 5 years. But everything that has happened has made me second guess our relationship. Recently I had a talk with someone and she mentioned how tough all this must be for me. Honestly I didn't really think about myself the ever since the accident, all I cared for was my girlfriend. But we kept talking and I ended up breaking down, because right there was the moment where I realized that this also has an impact on me, and our relationship. One thing that keeps repeating in my head is when she asked if I was my gf's caregiver. She has help that comes a few times a week, but I help her out whenever I can, though she doesn't always want me to. And if we stay together that's never going to change. I know how cruel this sounds but she will always be in a wheelchair. There's so much in the world we wanted to discover and do together but we can't do it together anymore and it so so breaks my heart. I am really bad at putting my thoughts into words sorry, I just don't really know what to write. I love her to the moon and back. But then I think, what kind of boyfriend am I if breaking up with her even crosses my mind. We were planning to get engaged next year. She's always so happy to see me and knows I've had issues dealing with the accident. She's so selfless it's not even funny. Sex hasn't really been working and she herself suggested I get a FWB so I don't get frustrated. But I don't know if that will fix anything and quite frankly, I don't want anybody else but her.

Sorry for this mess and I'm not an English speaker. Any way this is sort of like a vent but I don't know what to do. I sincerely don't. I know I should talk to her but I don't even know what to say to her, or how.",relationship_advice

"[CA] While on vacation, my landlord came into the house, locked my cat up without food, water, and litter box for at least 3-4 days. Cat is ok, just a lot skinnier. We are breaking the lease to move out, is there any chance we can get our deposit back? Landlord lives overseas.","San Francisco, CA

Hello, as the title stated, my landlord came by when we were on vacation (we knew about it), and started complaining about the house. One of the complaints was that the cat was roaming the house freely. We texted him and said that if you are locking up the cat, make sure she had her water, food, and litter box. 

We came home to the doors closed, and cat was in a room without any of the three essentials.  She clawed the carpet trying to get out, peed and pood everywhere, and most importantly, visibly skinnier. Cat doesn't usually hang out in that room by herself, coupled with the landlord's complaint about her, we suspect he did it on purpose even though he insisted it was an accident. He is overseas now.

We don't really want the headache of pursuing legal action - cat is fine, just need to eat more, and we just want to move out asap and leave this behind us. Is here anything we can leverage to keep our deposit? Deposit is one month's rent.

Edits: Luci is really ok. Her appetite is much smaller now than before so we will spoil her with wet food for the next few days. Vet said play with her more to build up an appetite.

We don't want to sue for personal reasons. The landlord said they will pay for the damages of the room. 

The lease says if we move out we have to pay for all the remaining months' rent. We just want to say ""hey, this is the law, so we should get our deposit back, and not pay for the remaining months."" Should we get a lawyer to write up something?

The landlord's complaints of the house weren't legit. They were about a dirty mug on our desk, us using a 100ft cable along the wall (stuck neatly to the wall with adhesive) to reroute the internet from the living room into the bedroom, detergent residue in the detergent dish of our washer, a blanket on the sofa, some amazon boxes by the hallway, and other trivial things, you get the idea.",legaladvice

AITA for not giving my empty row of plane seats to a mother with toddlers?,"This happened a couple weeks ago, but I'm still conflicted about it, so here goes. 

I travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. Most recently, I was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. This wouldn't be a problem except that I had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket I paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way I had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (Because I take this specific route and airline a lot, I knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can't recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since I just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)

Of course, when it came time to board, I get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. I politely told her that she'd made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. Her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before I got there, and would I do her the favor of just switching?

Here's the thing: if circumstances were different, I would have! But I explained that I had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that I could sleep. I really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids' seatbelts RIGHT THEN AND THERE. 

By this point the plane is filling up, I'm blocking the aisle, it's causing a whole thing, so I just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. The mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. The flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as I did) goes, ""This is an exit row. Your kids can't sit there because they're not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. There's not going to *be* another empty row. Please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.""

So I sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and I figure that's the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, I push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. When we land, I'm getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, ""You look like you slept well, bitch.""

So, Reddit. Am I the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?

**EDITED TO ADD:** Okay, thanks Reddit, I think most of you agree that I'm not the asshole here. But please do me a favor and don't refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. The kids were just fine. They watched something on their iPad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. Kids don't like flying more than anyone else, and it's not these girls' fault their mom acted like a jerk.",AmItheAsshole
How do I get them all to back off?,"My wife Sarah died 6 years ago when we were 29.  We'd been together 6 years, married for 1.  She died in a car accident on a ""girl's day out"" with her sister and 2 friends. Her sister and one friend survived. Sarah and one friend died.

Initially people understood my grief. Most were also grieving. After about 2 years people started to suggest I should be trying to ""move on"" and see other women.  After a while all my family and friends (with one exception) are saying it. Even my wife's parents are suggesting it. I never thought that would happen.

I know they are all doing it out of love but they don't understand how I feel. I have tried to explain it but it's not sinking in. I will NEVER get over losing Sarah.

I went for several grief counselling sessions 3 months after I lost her and again after 2 years. I understand that it's normal for the grief to ease and for the person to eventually move on. I just don't think that will happen to me.

I've improved. When it first happened I couldn't function. I thought the pain would kill me. I don't know how I got through the funeral. The idea of burying her, of putting her in the ground, on her own, was unbearable. I wanted to be buried with her. I just wanted to die with her. I didn't do anything but cry.

After about 7 months and the end of the first grief counselling sessions I got to a point where I could live through my days, do my job, eat, keep myself clean. That was all I could do.

After about 2 years I started to go out for basic social things. Family events, drinks with friends or colleagues etc.

That's when the suggestions started. People were trying to set me up or saying I should date. The number of people saying it and the forcefullness has increased. Some seem to have taken it on as a challenge. 

How do I get them to understand? I'll never get over Sarah. She was perfect for me. She was so funny and bright and loving and we matched in every way. I can't describe how happy we were together.

I have accepted that she has been stolen from me but I know I will never meet anyone I can love like that. It wouldn't be fair on another person to even try. I'd always have Sarah on my mind.

I've talked to plenty of women when I've been out with friends. I've had about 15 women ask me out over the last few years. They have been mostly attractive, funny, warm women but I only want Sarah.

They are never going to be Sarah, so I don't want to try. Nobody seems to get it. The only person who doesn't do it is Sarah's sister. She comes over 2 or 3 times each week. She was driving the car and survived the accident. I think she is too consumed with guilt to be trying to set me up with someone. The accident wasn't her fault but she still tortures herself and I have to set her straight. She is the only person not trying to persuade me to see other people. 

It doesn't help that the husband of the other girl who died in the accident has already remarried. Good for him. I'm different.

How do I get them to stop trying? How do I explain it without being too harsh with them all? I know they mean well but I need them to stop.

TLDR - Lost my wife in an accident and I can't get my family and friends to stop pushing me to date.

**Update** - Thank you all for the support and advice.  I've had several very good suggestions that do exactly what I need. Firm but without upsetting people who mean well.  As far as dating is concerned many people suggested changing ""never"" to ""not yet"". Friends and family will accept that.   (Thanks to /u/K-braithwaite and so many others  who suggested a version of that)  

One thing has come up that I wasn't expecting.  It became very clear to me while I was reading all the replies that **I should be doing more work on me** and less on others.     ( thanks to almost  everyone).    

With that in mind:   

I'm going to start therapy in October. (Thanks to /u/Lizam24 and all the others who made me realize I need it)

I've approached 2 online grief support groups     (thanks to /u/Quilt1974)   

And one group to meet in person     (thanks to /u/LadySushi)

(FINAL UPDATE) My new employer has a creative way of doing payroll that just doesnt seem...legal. Are you ready for a Justice Boner?,"Edit: a word and a state. SC. 

I was waiting to update this pending Big Doings by the corporate office, so thank you. 

So I quit, though I bet you all saw that coming. 

I gave 4 weeks notice per the crazy ass owners ""requirement"" because I decided to move out of state and had the time. 

Then he decided to try and screw me. When the schedule for my last 2 weeks came out, I wasn't on it. He apparently told the manager not to schedule me because I was ""toxic"" and ""not a team player"". 

But, as the saying goes, I didn't get mad. I got even. 

I knew he would try to call me in. Because that's what happens when you only have two people to close and one isn't working. So every time he called I said ""I wasn't scheduled today, so I made plans.""

After about a week he threatened to fire me. My response? ""You already did. Constructive dismissal exists. You reduced my hours to zero, basically firing me. I've already been to the unemployment office."" (I didn't, I was moving, but I wanted to hear his heart audibly stop.)

Then I asked about my last check. Since he's fired me, I needed to pick it up. He said I could get it on payday and hung up. 

I should also note that during this time I sent very lengthy email to the corporate office detailing every single shady and illegal thing this ass was doing. From trying to write work arounds for labor laws into the hand book, to getting employees to pay him back ""overpayments"" with personal checks, to the contamination, all of it. With pictures. 

So payday rolls around. No check. I call and no one answers. I go in person and no one knows anything because apparently, no one got paid. No one. Not even the managers. There's no direct deposit, he always cut paper checks (and forward dated them 3 days) so everyone was screwed. 

But me? I was walking on sunshine. Straight to small claims the next day with a written letter from the assistant manager (who's a friend, tbh) verifying that I had quit and not been paid and calls to the owner about it hadn't been returned. He had two days or until the next pay period, as long as it didn't exceed 30 days, to pay me after separation. 

He showed up and tried to say the Internet was down, which is why I wasn't paid on time, but the judge was having none of it. I got the max I could claim, 3x what he originally owed me. And the joy of seeing him get dressed WAY TF DOWN. 

And it gets better. Due to my emails and photos (along with other employees who made reports) Corporate descended on that franchise like a swarm of angry Valkyries. 

I was long gone and moved away by the time they actually did anything but he got ousted. 

Officially, he turned it over to spend time with his family (cause his daughter joined a Christian cult and ran away???)  but really corporate was FURIOUS at the shit he was doing and the terrible reputation the place had (essentially damaging the brand) so they threatened to rain legal brimstone down on him so hard it would make god jealous unless he turned the store over. 

According to the assistant manager anyways. 

Alls well that ends well. I got paid and Asshole Supreme got a banging dose of karma. ",legaladvice

"TIFU by Listening to Reddit and Eating my Girlfriends Ass, Which Caused a Peanut Allergy.","My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half. She is into butt stuff which is fine with me for the most part, but I've always told myself that I would never eat ass. I just think it's unsanitary and just gross. But she's dropped hints here and there that she would like me to do it, but I've always deflected it. I decided I might finally give it a try, maybe it won't be so bad. If it's something she would really enjoy it, why not? But then a concerning thought entered my head.

I have a peanut allergy and my girlfriend LOVES paydays, the peanut candy bars. There is a vending machine at her work and has one most days during her lunch break. I wasn't sure if it would be safe to eat her ass due to my allergy and her diet. So I decided to ask reddit.

Most of the replies said that it shouldn't be anything to worry about, so what the hell, let's go for it.

She gets off work and we start doing our thing and it comes time to toss the ol salad. It wasn't quite as bad as I thought it was going to be considering she keeps herself pretty clean. But after a few minutes, my throat started to get itchy and I could tell that my eyes were swelling up.

I pulled my face out from between her pooper cheeks and told her I'd be right back and ran to the bathroom. This obviously made her very self conscience. I was in the bathroom watching my face swell up for 5 minutes or so and when I came back I looked like Will Smith from Hitched when he eats the seafood. 

I had to explain to her that I was going to be fine (my peanut allergy is not life threatening or anything too serious) but it was a pretty awkward situation. She told me I didn't ever have to do it again, so I guess there's a silver lining to the story.

TLDR: I have a peanut allergy, and ate my girlfriends ass after she had a payday candy bar, causing my entire face to swell up.

""Why yes,"" says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many.""

Throwaway account as I am an avid Redditor. I have been contemplating writing this out because I feel like that action alone could offer me some much needed introspection. I will try not to drag on but I apologize If I do.

I (41M) have always considered myself comfortable with who I have grown to be, I have worked hard in life, have a 4 year degree, a great career, financial stability, loving friends, wonderful family. In many ways I have done well for myself, however, in terms of love, I am missing my mark. I have been single for about 7 years, prior to that I have dated my fair share, never was engaged or married, but I've had long term relationships, weekend flings and everything in between. Following my last relationship I decided to take a break from the dating scene and work on my career goals. So far, it's paid off, jumping 2 promotions in 7 years. I have felt unfulfilled in that department, but I was surprised how easily I could go 7 years without missing dating or companionship. I just simply don't miss it much.

A friend invited me out for beers and darts a few weeks ago. We usually go to the same little pub, where we know most of the normal faces. It's not uncommon for us to mix with the people playing at the board next to us. This night was no different, 2 guys set up on the board next to ours, we made small talk with them here and there, one of the men said his goodbyes and left, the other guy stayed behind and shot darts by himself, we offered him (lets call him James) a place on our board and shot some games of cut throat. things got fun, we drank quite a bit and we were having a lot of fun. My friend said he was ready to take off but James and I were having a good time so we decided to stay a bit longer.

My friend took off, James and I had a couple more rounds, we had quite a bit in common and It felt like I was hanging out with an old friend. He told me he had a rec room with a pool table and dart boards at his house with a built in bar. He showed me a few pictures of the room and I was thoroughly impressed. He suggested we go hangout there and I was on board. Since neither of us drove to the bar, we caught an Uber to his house which was only a few minutes away. We shot a few games of pool and chatted about more personal stuff, our past relationships, careers, college, upbringing, etc. James is a lot like me, never married and a career-minded guy. Things sort of took a turn in conversation when James asked me about my sexuality. He asked if I ever had a phase or experimented. I sort of laughed a bit and said no no, that wasn't something I'd ever done. He made one or two small remarks about it in jest and that was it. About another hour past and I told him I was taking off, we exchanged numbers and agreed to hangout again the following weekend, foregoing the bar and hanging out at his place to cook out on the grill.

I get home, off to bed, I get a text from him asking if I made it home safe, I didn't think too much into it but I did tell him I got home safe. The next day, Sunday. I got up and did my normal Sunday shuffle-off-the-Saturday-night-booze of going  on a jog, hitting my favorite lunch spot and recovering the rest of the day on the couch. About 3p I get a text from James asking If I was interested in coming over around 6p, he was going to grill some fish up and have a couple friends over. I thought that would be fun, so I went. We had another good time, this time I only stayed a couple hours and when I got there he told me his two friends cancelled so it would just be us. It wasn't a huge deal, he was good company. I took off around 9p. He sent me a text about 10 minutes after leaving saying he had fun and is looking forward to the weekend plans we made. I texted him back that I was looking forward to it as well.

The following day James sent me a text telling me about something funny that happened to him at work that morning, I don't keep my phone on me during work so I didn't see it until lunch time. I feel like it's important to note, I don't text people throughout the day, I guess I'm sort of old school but I don't chit chat with people via text often, so to me, James is reaching out more than I'm used to friends doing, but I didn't mind. I looked forward to talking to him. After work I went to the gym per usual and home. I saw someone who kinda looked like him, it made me think of him. On one of the TVs in front of the treadmills they were showing a TV show we talked about, it made me think of him. At the grocery store picking up dinner stuff, I walked past the seafood section and it made me think of him.

We texted throughout the week, I even started keeping my phone at my desk so I could text him. This isn't like me at all. Finally Saturday comes around and plans go off like normal, I actually got to his place a couple hours early. He suggested I invite my friend I was with when we met (well call him Mark), I did and Mark came along with me. We all had a terrific time, James cooked for us, we had plenty to eat and drink, spent time in the pool, shot darts, it was a blast. The end of the night comes around, Mark said he wanted to take off and again, I felt the urge to stay and hangout longer. Which is exactly what I did. This time we sat on his pool deck until 2 am talking about everything you could imagine. I realized the time and had to take off, he understood and instead of shaking hands he hugged me, this is not usual for me whatsoever, but it felt so naturally acceptable, like I WANTED him to do it. I left and this time I texted him from my Uber telling him that I'll let him know when I arrive safely.

That was a week ago, we didn't hangout this past weekend but we've texted daily and made plans to go hiking this coming Saturday. I thought about the way I feel about him and I've concluded it's the same way you feel when you meet someone who you fall in love with. Coupling that with his questioning me if I've ever fooled around with guys or had an 'experimental phase' kind of makes me think he feels the way I do and he may be gay or at least bi-sexual. I'm torn as far as what to do, because I love this feeling and I think I'm falling in love with this guy. It feels so strange to type that out but I think it's true. He is definitely flirting with me and I have decided I am definitely flirting back with him. Should I have a talk with him directly about this? Should I make a move on him? What if I do and it feels wrong? I have so many questions and I don't even know where to begin. Has anybody had this sort of thing happen? Is the reason I had no qualms with being single for so long because I lost interest in women subconsciously?  I have never outwardly been attracted to guys, but this isn't an attraction to a person physicality, this is deeper than that, which is why it's really screwing with me. Sorry I rambled a lot, but just typing this has been therapeutic. Thank you for reading.

Men respect women more than women respect men,"I know this sounds contrary to everything you've heard, but hear me out. From guys, I hear plenty of stupid comments. ""Women are crazy"" ""Women are too emotional"" ""Women overreact to everything"". It's either making dumb jokes from their buddies or wondering why their girlfriend/wife is angry with them. 

But I've only heard genuine loathing from women. ""Men are all the same"" ""Men are trash"" They're monsters, creeps, and on and on. And it isn't just certain men. I've heard multiple women say that all men are like that, not just certain individuals. I've never heard any man say they hate all women, but I've heard women say they hate all men. 

Lesser examples include the results from unhappy breakups. When men rant, it's about someone specific: ex-girlfriend or wife. If a woman's angry, it's a rant about the entire male gender. This is a generality of course and I can only speak from my own experience. 

Then there's the constant messages to men about how to treat women. Teach your son to respect women, teach men to respect women; treat your girlfriend like a princess, etc. Constant posts about how men don't have empathy for women. But very rarely have I seen it in reverse. I've encountered it maybe twice in my life. Many messages talking about how we need to respect women; very little about respecting men.

TIFU by destroying my first prize won in a hackathon,"Edit: Holy shit guys! My first 'shared' fuckup and immediately it's fuckup of the week?! Jesus Christ! So let's get on with the formalities: I'd like to thank my friends and family who stood by me while winning 4th prize only to fuck it up afterwards.

----

This wasn't today, but I just discovered this sub, so here it goes...

I participated at a hackathon (a competition for coders to make something in around 2 days), and I won 4th place. The were five spots that would get a prize.

When looking at the things I won, it was a t-shirt and some coupons for using various services for free. It was nice overall.

I live in NL, and the Hackathon was held in US so I had the stuff shipped to me. When the mail man came he had a large box, and asked for 50 euros (around $60) import taxes. I said: ""Wtf, is that shirt made of gold or something?"".

So I took the box and it was quite heavy too, not the ""just a tshirt kind of heavy"". Stupid me still thought there was only a tshirt inside it. So he said: ""if you don't accept it we'll take it back to customs where it'll be destroyed"". So I said ""Yeah take it I'm not gonna pay for shit I won, especially when it's just a tshirt"".

A few days later, I went to my PC and an email popped up from the organisation stating: ""Hey we added a laptop too"".

I was like: ""WTF?!"". So I quickly called the postal office and the organisation to see if they could send it back anyway, but it was already with customs.

tl;dr I won a prize and then lost it again because customs destroyed it after I refused to pay import taxes.",tifu
"(Iowa) Accepted into a grad school, one week before last day at work and signed lease begins I am notified that the acceptance was a clerical error and will likely be rescinded.","**UPDATE:** I finally got through to the admissions folks at the school and they decided to admit me without funding for the first year. So I am happy because I will get the opportunity to prove that I should've been accepted flat-out the first time and secure funding in 2020 hopefully. Thanks so much for all of the advice and PMs though! 

I applied for a few grad programs for Fall 2019 and was accepted to my top choice, a very close second choice, and a distant third choice that is also at the same school as the top choice. I received letters in the mail for (1) and (3) and an email from (2). I quickly followed the directions in the letter for (1) and emailed the head of the program, the program secretary, the head of assistantship placements, and also Professor X that I had been corresponding with on research. No replies from any of them, but I excused it because it was April and was deadweek/finals.

Three months later (two weeks ago), I remember that I have no information on my program that is starting next month and re-email Professor X asking about assistantships. He replies immediately and says that when I emailed him in April, he checked with the head of the program and found out that I wasn't admitted. For some reason, he didn't see it fit to respond to me and let me know that there was an error in my admittance. 

In talking to the secretary today (that also failed to respond to me in April), I find out that the program coordinator for choice (3) somehow accidentally accepted me to choices (1) and (3) -- secretary has no clue how that happened and thinks that it's likely that my offer will be rescinded because it is a competitive school. 

..I'm floored because #1, I quit a very well-paying and enjoyable job to go back to school and #2, I have already signed a lease in a city that I otherwise wouldn't have moved to. Further, if I wouldn't have gotten into (1), then I absolutely was going to accept (2) and move to a different part of the country. Now I'm screwed because I already have a lease and can't afford to pay two at one time on a student's earnings.

Do I have any legal recourse? Professor X said that he *knew* back in April that I wasn't accepted and just chose to never respond to me. The likely scenario now is that I might be able to get into my last choice -- but at this point there is no way that funding is still available. Let me know if there is any more information that I can provide. 

Thanks!",legaladvice
"Tenant is renting out my apartment on AirBnB. Tenant isn't responding, AirBnB doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. I have no idea how to even handle this.","Location: Toronto, Ontario

I own an apartment in downtown Toronto, our building has had a bad history of problems with AirBnB tenants so we voted to ban any sort of short term rental. Currently i am on the other side of the continent for work, and won't be back until January.

I decided to list my place up for a rental in late August, for rental until Janaury. Since the rental time was almost half a year it doesn't count as a short term rental (several people do this in our building and it is fine). I immediately got a hit by a person named Jane who was a student about to start grad school (i don't know if this is true or not), and we talked and decided to agree to the rental.She signed a document indicating she agreed to the buildings rules, including the notice about ""No short term rentals, through services such as AirBnB"".

Yesterday i got an email from our property manager:

* On Monday they were testing each units smoke detectors, and he noticed there were 3 people in the unit. Along with a strong smell of pot. They apparently identified themselves as AirBnB renters. (Apparently they tried to deny our property manager from entering, since they weren't sure of who he was since they were only renting this place for a week through AirBnB).
* I am violating the rule about no short term rentals.
* I am apparently in violation of a bunch of rule violations such as the fact that more people are staying in my unit than permitted.
* Apparently multiple guests have been parking overnight in the visitors spot (not allowed) who all recorded my unit number as the one they are visiting.

After getting that email i called him and confirmed, and i was able to find my place listed on AirBnB, using very recent photos of my apartment. I tried to contact Jane, through email (no response), phone calls go to voice mail, and facebook (she blocked me after i sent her a message).

I have tried numerous times to talk to AirBnB, but all they have told me is they can't do anything about this, and basically refused to do anything about the listing.

Aside from all the issues above, frankly i don't feel comfortable with a bunch of random strangers in my apartment at all. Unfortunately i have no idea even what to do about this legally speaking. Do i have any way to block these random people from entering my unit?

\*EDIT\* I forgot to add, that i have talked to a lawyer about evicting the tenant however he told me it could take upto 2+ months, which is why it won't really help. Since by then in \~2 months her lease will be over. I want to stop randoms from AirBnB from entering my apartment now. ",legaladvice
My mother (50F) asks me (20F) to travel home to wake up my teenage brother (15M),"Hi everyone,

This morning I was yelled at down the phone by my mother for refusing to travel 1 hour home and back to wake my 15 year old brother up for school. She has always babied and coddled him, to the point where he is 16 this year and she still puts his socks on for him, brings all his meals and snacks to him and makes zero attempt to help him mature. He is never left home alone, she tells him what to do and when, and both of my parents lives revolve around him. He does not know how to boil a kettle, and has never done anything independently. If he doesn't want to do something, he will have a tantrum. I would like to point out that he has no learning difficulties or anything like that that would explain this. He has just not grown up. My birthday day out to London was cancelled because he didn't want to go, and I was called selfish as a result. I am 20, I've been living away from home at university one city away for about 2 years now.

Previously, she has asked me to come home from university to walk my brother 15 minutes home from school, at 4pm, along a route he has done 1000x before. Yesterday, she called me to ask if I would come home from uni on Wednesday to put my brother's dinner on as she is going to a funeral. A sad event, but of a relative she rarely sees who is very old and died naturally. I am not saying she shouldn't go to the funeral, just that it was not out of the blue. She had been preparing for this for a while. I said I wasn't happy about it, but I didn't have plans that day, so fine.

This morning she calls me to say the funeral was at 9:30am so she'd be back by tea-time. I thought great, no reason for me to come home as my brother is at school. But actually she now wants me to come back Tuesday evening (late) after volunteering and a busy day. Tuesday evening is the only time I get to see my boyfriend this week, so I said no. The reason she wants me to come back is so I can wake my brother up for school Wednesday morning and make sure he locks the front door. I told her that was too much of an ask for something he can do himself, and she proceeded to call me a selfish child, and that 'we all have to do things we don't want to do' and that she has made sacrifices for me. At this point I just said I wasn't having this conversation and hung up. I then text her to explain that I don't want to come back for multiple reasons- my boyfriend, I have a busy day on Tuesday, and it's just not practical. Plus the reason she wants me to come back is ridiculous, as he is almost 16 and can easily set an alarm. I shouldn't have to travel 2 hours round-trip to wake my 16 brother up for school.

So, am I being unreasonable? I understand she is going to a funeral, but surely this is unacceptable. I am a 20 year old woman with a life of her own in a completely different city. If my brother had to be left alone for days of course I would come back, or if something sudden happened. But he is almost 16, and will literally be at school for most of the day they want me back. He should be able to wake himself up for one day, get himself breakfast and walk out the door- he gets picked up by someone else's mum before school.

Any advice at all would help.

TLDR: My mum is going to a funeral on Wednesday and wants me to travel a 2 hour round trip to wake my 15 YO brother up for school. She has a history of babying him and I'm a university student with my own life in a different city. Am I wrong to say no and that he should just set an alarm seeing as I have other plans? Edit: typo. 

Update: I called my dad to explain the situation and he said he agreed with my mother and that I was a disappointment to the family. He said it was not about what they asked me to do but that they rarely ask for help and when they do I should always help where I can- it was the principle that counts. He also said I was opening a can of worms and that there's a lot I should be doing at 20 that I'm not. When I asked what I should be doing he said driving, which is ridiculous as I live in a big city and the only reason I'm not learning is because it's too expensive and would be useless when I can easily bus/train everywhere. He knows this. He then repeated he was disappointed in me and I hung up the phone, upset, after saying I don't know want more they want me to do. I had a job I've saved my wages from so I can budget accordingly, I do well at university, I am good with money, I have responsible friends and a great boyfriend, I make time to see my parents when I can. Currently feeling very hopeless and deflated. Thank you for your support though, everyone",relationship_advice

"AITA for sending my kid to school with ""adult"" snacks and lunches?","Living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. I have a second grader who I have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. 

She came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more ""appropriate"" snacks and lunches. I thought for a minute that maybe I accidentally grabbed one of my Quest Bars or something for her and asked my daughter.

For her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. My daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, I put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. The teacher commented on it.

Lunchtime came around, and I guess a similar thing happened. My kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week I made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. Her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and I guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. This is what sparked the note. 

So I explained that she shouldn't share ""spicy"" foods with her friends, and figured I'd skip the pickles next time. Well, it wasn't good enough. Just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send ""age appropriate"" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a PB & J, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.

I called the teacher and asked her about the note. Teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is ""a little kid"" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating ""adult food"" yet. I asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said ""No"" and ""This really shouldn't be a big deal.""

This might be where I fucked up. I told the teacher that I'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. That when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, I will continue to send my kid to school with the foods I pick. Teacher got huffy and hung up. 

Just to double check, I asked my daughter two things: Does she LIKE her lunches? (Enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and ""Are the other kids making fun of you?"" because I know that can be an issue. She said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. 

So AITA, or is this teacher way out of line?",AmItheAsshole
"TIFU by putting tequilla in the wrong hole, on purpose","So I'm a guy who is generally unsatisfied with life currently, and looking for new experiences. So when thinking of something to do with a large bottle of tequila that I absolutely couldn't stand the flavor of, I thought back to when I read about about a bunch of crazy frat boys that invented butt chugging. I thought it'd be perfect because it'd be a crazy new experience and that way I wouldn't taste the tequila. 

I decided on two and a half jiggers administered by a large syringe (not the kind with a needle). I had heard of people overdosing by putting in whole bottles so I wasn't about to be that stupid. With my butt in the air, I began to slowly inject the fluid into my anal cavity. Sure it stung a little bit, but I wasn't deterred. 

I waited and nothing happened.

Finally I decided it was time to expel the stuff and head to bed. That was the hard part. The burning was like a mother puma giving birth in my butthole. The pain in my unhappy intestines began to grow to a roar. Then I began to literally sweat tequila. It was pretty warm in the bathroom, but this was no normal sweat. I could taste the harsh flavor of agave in every drop of sweat that rolled down my face into my mouth. The last stage was desparate contractions of my poo muscles (to be scientific) coupled with nausea and several close calls with emptying my stomach. Well, that and fear, regret, some bargaining with higher powers. 

I was in the bathroom suffering for an estimated 1 1/2 to 2 hours. During this all this i noticed only a vague sensation of alcoholic stupor. I tested myself multiple times to see if I was drunk. No dice.

Yesterday I woke up to serious muscle cramps in my abdomen and a run to the bathroom which resulted in a mess of bloody mucus. I'm still contemplating a hospital visit.

That was on Thursday and my bowels are still sore. I suspect I may have internal burns, but hopefully they'll heal on their own. I dread seeing a doctor because my parents will get the whole story and they still think I'm a decent young man who definitely doesn't drink.



TL:DR I squirted straight tequila into my anus and damaged my insides. 


Edit: For all you lovely people showing concern, I am still alive. My symptoms are currently very mild and seem non-threatening (no blood, only some mild discomfort). A hospital visit is probably not necessary. No, I'm not an alcoholic, but I can see how it could easily happen. No I am not a minor (I turned 21 in may). I am American. I do struggle with depression, but have not purposefully harmed myself in the last four years (I started seeing a psychologist recently anyway). The whole ""add salt and lime to your ass hole"" joke was probably funny the first time someone posted it on here, and not the other 300 times.

Hope I answered all your questions. :)

(Update to) I [32M] was going to propose to my girlfriend [30F] until she told me she's pregnant,"I was thinking I'd edit the original post, but I decided I'd rather spend the night focused on my fiance than on reddit. Since the original post really blew up I don't think too many people would see an edit, so I'm making a new post instead.

I took my lunch break early to be with my girlfriend at the OBGYN visit. The IUD was removed without any problems (it had shifted around which likely caused it to fail), and the pregnancy is not ectopic. However, a miscarriage is more likely, and if the baby is carried to term, there's a higher chance for complications and defects. It's far from a guarantee but it's a lot more risky than if it was any other birth control method that failed. I ended up taking the rest of the afternoon off so we could talk through everything together. Eventually we decided we should get out of the house so we put some leftovers in my lunch bag and went to the park.

Normally there is nothing special about eating day-old hoagies in a park, but it really helped us relax. We sat on a blanket at the spot we first met and talked about a lot of things. Eventually the sun began to set and I decided it was time. I started to say I had been planning to do this for awhile and it wasn't because she was pregnant but she started tearing up and cut me off. She told me she understood so I skipped the rest of my fluff and asked her to marry me. She said yes, and we spent the next few minutes crying, hugging, and kissing. After we got our emotions under control she told me she'd seen my post (I knew she used reddit but I didn't realize she lurked here) and had been expecting it all evening. She said she would have preferred I proposed at our anniversary dinner (can't argue with that) but this was still about as lovely as she could have hoped for.

Although the shadow of a potentially stormy pregnancy is looming above us, I am still very happy and feel lucky to be with her. We're going to visit our parents this weekend to break the news and get through the mountain of questions they're sure to have. We're not thinking about a wedding ceremony yet, but we'll definitely be getting our marriage ~~license~~  certificate (thanks for pointing out the difference) in the next few months like someone suggested.

These past few days have been a roller coaster of emotion. Thanks for helping me get over my worries.

TIFU by being too horny for my boyfriends good [NSFW],"Obligatory happened a couple days ago

I was enjoying a lovely morning with my boyfriend. Talking, cuddling, farting together... you know the drill. Just the comfortable phase of relationship when you no longer worry about being perfect human beings.
Well, after some cuddling, I noticed that his morning wood wasn't gone. At all. And even though we had some amazing sex last night, I decided I wanted more. He was just so sexy, laying in his bed, I couldn't resist.

After some teasing, we went to do it. We're pretty boring, maybe too romantic and really lazy, so we wanted just a classic missionary. Ya know, nothing too wild. But I want it quick and kinda rough.

While we were doing it, I'm telling him to speed up, even though I know he is tired from yesterday. And he does.

Suddenly, he tells me he got a cramp in his back. Okay, I thought, it will go away. It will be fine. It's just a cramp. Let's continue. Right?

Wrong.

He stopped. His face looked like he was in a lot of pain. His whole body looked like he was in a lot of pain. And he was still  inside of me.

Then he told me:""Babe? I can't move. It hurts. I think I'm gonna need help.""

Well.

I had to carefully operate myself from under him and take off his condom. I also had to try not to burst out laughing because of the absurdity or crying because he was in pain. 

The best part? Trying to put his pants up, so he won't be totally naked when the fucking ambulance I had to call will arrive. The whole time he was almost screaming from pain.

The REALLY best part? Trying to frantically get rid off all evidence of what we were doing just for him to tell everyone ""Yeah, I did this to myself during morning sex with my girlfriend.""

Now he is stuck in bed for a week and I'm wondering if my pussy was really worth calling ambulance and all that pain.

TLDR; My vagina apparently feels so good my boyfriend got an acute lumbago in his back while being in it.

Edit: Guys, the TLDR was a sarcasm and a joke.

Edit 2: Aaaand he laughs about it now too. He was the one asking me to cover him so noone else would see him bare naked. He also saw this post before I submitted it (even told me to put it on reddit, because it is kinda funny) and is the one making most jokes about it. At the moment it was terrifying, but now he´s okay, so why shouln´t we laugh about it?",tifu
I (22M) was sexually assaulted by a girl at a party and my girlfriend (23F) walked in on it happening - she broke up with me after slapping me in the face and now I am devastated,"** Update: thanks everyone for the kindness and support. I have made an appointment with my schools counseling center and they said that they can definitely hear me out and help me present my case to the appropriate school authorities. **

——————————————————————

Hi. I am a 22M senior year in college. My girlfriend is a 23F in grad school at the same university.

We have been dating for six months and everything was going well or so I thought.

Over the weekend, we both attended a party and got quite a bit drunk.

At one point I got up to go to the bathroom, and another woman followed me into the bathroom and started forcing herself on me.

I tried to make her stop but she whispered in my ear ""if you scream, I will tell them that you raped me now shut the fuck up"".

I began crying but she proceeded to do things to me which I never wanted to do with anyone, ever. And I never wanted to be forced.

After a few minutes (or eternity whichever is longer), my girlfriend went to find me and three open the the bathroom door to find me being assaulted.

Her first instinct was to scream, which attracted a crowd. My rapist/assailant, backed away and like a deer in headlines, gasped and pointed to me and said ""he started it!"".

At that point my girlfriend tried to kick my testicles but thankfully I protected them but then she immediately smacked my face while I was busy protecting my crotch.

Then she ran out of the party and texted me ""never fucking talk to me again ever scumbag and if you do I will get the police involved""

I tried responding back that I did not chose what happened and that I was a victim not the instigator but she doesn't believe me at all.

I went to the campus public safety office and they tried to ask me questions as if I was the person doing the sexual assaulting. I ended up leaving before I got in trouble myself. 

I'm fucking devasted and don't know where to turn. She fucking hates my guts and thinks that I tried to seduce or assault another woman when really it is the opposite of what actually happened.",relationship_advice
"LPT: Instead of using the phrase ""I assumed..."" use the phrase ""My understanding was...""","The phrase ""I assumed..."" has a very negative connotation, and people will view it as you jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.




On the other hand, if you use the phrase ""My understanding was..."", it has a way more positive connotation. Plus people will just view it as you made a slight mistake in understanding, and will be far kinder to you.



This is best applied in a workplace/professional environment. If you tell your boss that you ""assumed"" something typically results in a reprimand; saying ""My understanding was..."" will instead just be viewed as a miscommunication.",LifeProTips

UPDATE: Student's mother found out I was abused as a teen and is now telling everyone I'm a danger to the kids. I might lose my job. [NY],"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3y3b7m/students_mother_found_out_i_was_abused_as_a_teen/)

Let me start by thanking everyone who took the time to give me advice and answer my questions in the previous post. That was a very helpful starting point. There were a few requests for updates so here we go. 

Many of you suggested that I contact an attorney to write her a letter, which is exactly what I did. He said if I *really* wanted to pursue this with a lawsuit, I might be able to. But to be honest, I'd much rather not spend the time and resources if I don't have to, especially since my last court experience was less than great. I'm not looking for a big payout. I just want to move forward with my life. 
 
I asked my boss if we could set up a time to meet since we're technically closed this week. I knew she was aware of the situation since this woman had posted on our facebook page which my boss manages, but I wasn't really sure where my boss stood on the issue, so I was pretty anxious going in. I told my boss about my visit with the lawyer and about the letter he was going to send her. Turns out, she had a lawyer friend of hers do the exact same thing on behalf of the business. So this woman got not one, but two letters ordering her to shut the hell up, from two different lawyers. Hopefully that is enough to scare her into keeping her mouth shut. 

She told me to just avoid this lady at all costs. Like if I run into her at the grocery store, turn around. Her daughter is still taking classes with another teacher during a time when I'm not working. She said she knows this woman is batshit crazy and if she thought there was any real concern regarding me being around kids she would have fired me. She also said she thinks I've been doing a great job handling this and that overall the kids and parents respond really well to me and she's glad to have me on her staff. Always nice to hear and at this point it looks like my job is not in jeopardy. 

The facebook posts have been deleted. Not sure if Facebook did it after I reported them, or if she did it herself. Hopefully this is the last you'll be hearing from me. Big thanks to the community for your wise advice and kind words.

"My (19F) friend (18M) shared some very disturbing sexual fantasies with me, and I really can't stop thinking about it","The other day I was out for the night with my friend group.

One of my best friends in the group is a guy (most are girls). He and I are pretty close and have been since early in high school.

We were kind of separated from everyone else and drinking alone. The topic of sex and relationships came up. I started teasing him about never having had a steady girlfriend, which led to the subject of sexual fantasies and preferences coming up, and he admitted he had some 'weird ones'.

I asked him what he was talking about, because I was curious. He didn't want to say, so I tried to loosen him up by describing some of my fantasies, which was mostly (in his view) fairly 'vanilla' stuff like role play and stuff. Finally, once he'd gotten fairly drunk, he said he had 'really violent' kinks. I said that wasn't that unusual. He said he didn't mean 'like BDSM stuff'.

Finally, he told me he fantasizes about 'grabbing a girl and driving her out in the middle of nowhere and just slashing her fucking throat or bashing her skull in.' Most of these fantasies didn't even involve sex or even violent sex, it was the killing itself that was a sexual act to him. It was like a filter had come off now and he starts telling me all about it. He said he really got off on the image of a girl begging for her life. He also said the only kind of porn that could even get him off was (simulated, not real) death/murder porn.

The whole thing and the detail he went into really shook me up. I get that fantasies are harmless as long as they don't cross the line into reality, but I honestly wasn't expecting anything like this. I'm a girl and most of our friends are actually girls, which makes it a little scarier for me.

I feel bad for making this post because I feel like I'm betraying his trust, and I'm the one who pushed him to tell me, but I honestly couldn't stop thinking about this and it's really bothering me.

He's a really sweet, soft-spoken guy in general, but on the rare occasions he gets angry, it's really scary. He gets *really* angry, and seeing it in his face is almost like seeing a mask come off. It reminds me a little of what they used to say about Ted Bundy.

I don't think he's in imminent danger of hurting anyone, and I don't think he really would, but I'm wondering if I should suggest he look into therapy or at least talk to someone?

Am I overreacting? Are these kinds of fantasies relatively common amongst guys? I really don't know, but this is driving me crazy!

TL;DR friend of mine told me his sexual fantasizes involve torturing and killing girls and he can't even get off without it. I'm really shaken up now.",relationship_advice
"Update - I posted a bunch of creepy texts guys have sent me, onto Facebook and Instagram.","This is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9hqz2h/i_25f_posted_a_bunch_of_creepy_texts_guys_have/

 To recap my last submission, I posted an album of creepy texts I'd recieved from men in my field (computer engineering). Some from classmates and a TA in college, some from people I met through internships and professional development activities, and some I know through my current job. I had been so fed up with the sense of shame and being silenced and not believed, about sexual harassment. And, for what it's worth, putting a large collection of harassing and threatening texts in the public eye, raw and unedited, made them difficult to ignore or explain away. After that post, I got a meeting invitation from my company's HR department, for this Monday.

A lot happened over the weekend. I did a lot of research into employment law, I read through the whole company handbook again, and for each person I mentioned in my social media posts, I wrote out up a detailed account of their behavior towards me for my own reference, stuff that had not been said over text.

I also screenshot and backed up any angry or threatening texts towards me, that I received this weekend from the men whose old texts I'd posted online.

----

I think its worth giving some background on the four people included in my social media posts that I knew from my current job.

(Coworker 1) A few months ago, I had reported him to HR for sexual harassment in the past, and he was moved off my team to another position in the company where he would not have any contact with me. He had signed a paper saying that he must not contact me for any reason, whether that is work related or not. I didn't sign anything during this process.

The messages from him that I posted on Facebook were old texts from him, to my personal phone. Making a comment about how I looked nice at work, and how I must have been dressing up for him. I'd replied that I was not. He asked me who I was dressing up for at work, if not him. Because then he'd know who to be jealous of. I said 'myself' and told him to stop texting me on my personal phone. A few days later, he sent me a message telling me my new hair color was ""hot"" and asking me to drinks. That was a small snippet of creepy things he'd sent me, there was plenty more that I didn't post.

I found out today that he was the one who showed HR my posts, as I understand it, he had assumed I had signed a similar no-contact agreement that he'd had to. I had not ever made that agreement, in writing or vocally. I'd just not been talking to him because I had no desire to.

(Coworker 2) He was married, and in the office, he didn't seem to do anything out of line. He had my number since I would be traveling for work and wanted my team members to be able to contact me. (We don't have work cell phones) 

Out of the blue, he texted me asking me to join him at a fancy seafood restaurant when I returned from my work trip. It sounded like a date. I texted back ""uh you're married"" and he said some shit about how nobody would have to know, and how I seemed like a girl who could keep a secret. I told him to fuck off. 

He was fired a week later for unrelated reasons, so while I'd been thinking about going to HR, I never did. I haven't heard from him since, even after my social media post.

(Coworker 3) He was also married. One time I was at a work happy hour and I left pretty early. He texted me on my work instant messaging platform, which I have on my phone, asking me to go party with him. I asked ""Is your wife coming"" and didn't get a response. I didn't think it was bad enough to report to HR as sexual harassment, because something usually has to be done repeatedly to qualify as harassment, unless it is something egregious. (That was in the company handbook, in less concise words) 

That text exchange was included in my post.

After my post, he sent me a slew of threatening texts. Apparently his wife had seen the post, and I had ""ruined his family"". He said that I was about to ""get what was coming 4 me real soon"", and to ""watch out"" which sounded like a threat. Also called me a couple homophobic slurs. (I'm openly bisexual)

(Coworker 4) He had just broken off an engagement. I didn't hear that from him, just through the rumor mill. He contacted me asking me if I wanted to go out, and I said that he wasn't really my type to date. He said that he wasn't looking for anything serious, just casual sex. I didn't reply for a few hours and then he sent me a second text saying ""Well then go ahead and be a bitch and leave me on read""

Since it happened outside of work, and was not any kind or repeated harassment, I also didn't think that it would be reasonable to bring it to HR unless I saw a pattern of similar behavior. He didn't contact me again, even after my post.

------

As for people from past jobs, internships, or classes...

My college contacted me about my old TA who had tried to hook up with me repeatedly, and stopped helping me with the course when it was clear he wasn't getting anywhere. They asked me if I'd give a statement. Apparently he was still doing that shit, and someone else had reported him. And they saw from my post that I'd likely have something to report too.

A married guy who tried to get with me when I was an intern at another company sent me some really angry and threatening texts, I have to figure my instagram post (with his public Instagram account tagged) caused problems in his marriage. I definitely have been taking extra steps to stay safe when I'm leaving my apartment or going anywhere. I'm considering reporting this to the police because it was the most overtly threatening thing I've received.

A few other people I tagged sent me texts telling me how shitty it was not to keep private conversations private, etc. I ignored all those.

-----

As for what happened this morning, in my HR meeting... I was all ready to go in with (metaphorical) guns blazing, defend everything I'd said or done with sources from the company handbook.

Such as how I did not violate the company social media policy, as it only prohibited pretending to speak for the company as a whole if PR is not your job, or reveal confidential code or design or business contracts online. (I didn't mention my company in my post, or anywhere else on my social media)

I was also ready to defend how I followed the guidelines of what is considered sexual harassment and should be reported. How I reported repeated harassment, but didn't report isolated incidents that were not extreme. (The examples of extreme conduct included unwanted overtly sexual touching, or threats of violence. The handbook specifically mentioned that asking someone out once was not harassment)

But the meeting ended up being much more low-key than I had been expecting.

I'd taken down both posts Sunday, as an act of good faith, though I doubted that would matter much.

When I went in, I sat down and asked if I could record the meeting. The HR representative (I'll call her Beth here but that's not her real name of course) said Ok. She wanted to talk about each of the specific people I'd posted screenshots from, who work at the company. (Those made up less than a third of my screenshots FYI)

First was Coworker 1. The guy I had previously reported to HR and who had been moved to a different team and told that he must not speak to me or contact me. Beth said that he had brought the posts to her attention, as he was under the impression that the ""no contact"" agreement went both ways. I reminded her that I had not entered into a written or verbal agreement. I was surprised it was him who brought it up, but I didn't say anything. She asked if there had been continued harassment or contact from him after my initial report. I said no. She moved on to the next quickly.

Coworker 2 had been fired a while back for unrelated reasons, but Beth still asked if there had been any further conflict between us, while he was employed, other than the text messages. I said no.

She asked me the same question about Coworker 3. I told her that I had received texts from him on Saturday, that came across as threatening, and used several slurs about my sexuality. I gave her a printout of those messages. She read them, and immediately stepped out to show them to her manager. She came back after a few minutes to continue talking with me.

And again for Coworker 4. I told her that he had not contacted me after he said I was a bitch for leaving him on read

Beth asked me if I had any questions, and I basically asked what her next steps would be. She said that she would have asked me to remove the posts so that things could be handled with discretion, however I had already removed both prior to the meeting.  She also said that she would be meeting again with Coworkers 1 and 4. She also said that due to coworker 3's threatening comments, he had been escorted out of the building while we had been speaking. Fired. Apparently he was already on record with them, for another issue relating to his temper, and this was the last straw.

She also asked me why I had not brought coworkers 2, 3, and 4 to her attention before. And I cited the section on harassment from the company handbook, saying that harassment was repeated unwanted comments or actions. And that a single event is not usually considered harassment unless it is extreme. The conversations with those three men had been isolated incidents.

She asked me if I would be more comfortable taking a personal day for the rest of the day, while she speaks to Coworkers 1 and 4. She said she wanted to make it clear that I was not being dismissed or escorted out, I was not getting fired, it was only a precaution so that I would not be around Coworkers 1 and 4, in case either of them wanted to confront me personally. I said I would.

So that's where I'm at right now.

I figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. This all happened a few days ago. 

The day I made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. Well, that didn't turn out well. 

Before I told her about my background, I asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards Jews. She pretty much sounded like Hans Landa the whole time. At one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for ""teaming up"" with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible ""prank"" on a Jewish student. 

Afterwards I bluntly told her that I'm Jewish. She didn't believe me at all and thought I was joking. I told her that I was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. This went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

When it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. Things went 0-100 very fast. She got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. She said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. When she insulted me I reminded her that she really liked me despite my ""dirtiness"" which just pushed her over the edge. She cried hysterically and I left. 

The next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that SHE dumped me and not the other way around.  She warned me not tell people that I dumped her since that would make her look bad. I didn't say anything and closed the door. I heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare I close the door in her face and that ""you people are all the same"". After a while she left and started writing me on Snapchat. I blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. I've never seen her act so crazy. 

Long story short, I blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. I knew things wouldn't go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but I didn't know it would be this bad. Some of her stuff is still at my place. Oh well

TIFU How I glued my ass cheeks together,"So last night I was bored as fuck and I decided to get my wife's waxing stuff and and try my luck at waxing my ass crack, because, let me tell you it's a fucking jungle down there. 
I've never waxed before and I didn't bother looking up how to do it because uh who tf needs directions.
I plugged the machine in and it took forever to heat up. When it was finally ready I took one of those sticks and just went to fucking town on my ass crack and my gooch.
I knew basically how this works so I opened the drawer to get a wax strip out... and there were none left.
I tried everything as a substitute I was freaking out I used:
a shirt (which now has ass hair on it)
an ace bandage
duct tape
after about 30 minutes the wax was dried and my ass was completely stuck together and I had made little to no progress so I had to do the unthinkable ..

rip all of the hair out by hand

for what felt like forever I sat in the shower ripping hair out of my ass crack with only my bare hands which also had wax all over them and were now completely covered with ass hair.

"AITA, for telling an overweight girl to lose some weight?","So basically I've been going to school with this one girl for 5-6 years now, she's always been overweight. This year I think she is at her heaviest. She's always complained about her weight and how people make fun of her for it (not to be but I she's loud when she talks to her friends. 

About a week ago I walked by her and her friends near my locker, she was red faced and looked like she's been crying alot. One of her friends looked at me and said ""what?!"" Kinda angrily, I turned around to try to just avoid it I guess and she said ""what are you looking at?!"". I sheepishly turned around and said ""if being made fun of for being overweight bothers you so much, maybe it's worth losing some of it"". 

AITA? I wasn't trying to be rude or anything but she and her friends were kinda shocked I'd say that.

Edit: not trying to defend myself but I'd just like to clarify that she was upset in this instance about her mother telling her to lose some weight, and she does eat a lot of food even when she's happy and would definitely be full (from what I hear every other day after lunch her stomach is stretched/full)",AmItheAsshole
AITA for having an Almanac?,"A bit of backstory. I met my wife in the summer of 2008. She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 ""tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!"" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.
It started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.
I get a call from her around 11am. ""What the fuck is The Almanac?"" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says ""I always thought you remembered this stuff..."" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my ""playbook"" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.

[IL] Neighbor is using my paid parking spot (& has even gotten me towed). Landlord hasn't done anything,"I rent an apartment, and an assigned exterior parking space within my complex's parking lot is included in my rent. I have a parking pass that I display in my car, and documentation from my landlord stating that this specific spot belongs to me.

I have a neighbor that always parks in my spot. I have contacted my landlord every time this happens asking him to handle it, but nothing ever happens. I have also kept a log of every time I notice this neighbor in my spot & when I've contacted my landlord. (For what it's worth, neighbor does not have a visible parking pass on his car, and also puts a cone in my spot when he's gone to reserve it, so I don't think this is just confusion - I don't think he owns a spot at all).

This past weekend, said neighbor had my car towed from my spot. I confronted him in person, but all he did was claim that the spot was his. I once again contacted my landlord, who stated that this spot was indeed mine, I shouldn't have been towed, and he would speak with my neighbor to reiterate that it is my spot.

Well, apparently neighbor didn't listen, because last night he was in my spot again. I called a towing company (same one that towed me) to have him towed last night, but they either didn't come or were talked out of it by him, because when I woke up this morning, his car was still there.

Additional info that might be relevant: my complex is managed by an HOA, & my landlord always claims he'll ""notify them"" when I make a complaint about my neighbor. 

I'm growing incredibly frustrated with this situation, as I pay for this spot. With that being said, I'd appreciate advice on the following questions:

1. What can I do to stop my neighbor from using my spot?
2. What actions can I take to ensure my neighbor doesn't get me towed from a spot that I am authorized to use?

Update edit: I just spoke with the HOA. They confirmed that the spot is mine & that this neighbor doesn't even have a parking spot at all. HOA also said he should've never been authorized to have my car towed, and are speaking with the towing company to ensure it won't happen again. Finally, they provided me with a 24/7 emergency number that I can call to have my neighbor towed every time he is in my spot. ",legaladvice
Six Lessons of Life,"**Lesson 1:**

A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, ""I'll give you $800 to drop that towel."" After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob.

After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…

""Who was that?"" ""It was Bob the next door neighbour,"" she replies. ""Great!"" the husband says, ""Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?""

*Moral of the story:*

If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.

**Lesson 2:**

A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out.

**Lesson 3:**

A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said,""Father, remember Psalm 129?"" The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, ""Father, remember Psalm 129?"" The priest apologized ""Sorry sister but the flesh is weak."" Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, ""Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.""

**Lesson 4**

A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him, ""Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long?"" The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.

A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.

**Lesson 5:**

Power of Charisma

A turkey was chatting with a bull ""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,"" sighed the turkey, but I haven't got the energy."" ""Well, why don't you nibble on my droppings?"" replied the bull. ""They're packed with nutrients."" The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.

*Moral of the story:*

Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there

**Lesson 6**

A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.

*Moral of the story:*

Circumcising a newborn baby is mutilation and should be made illegal.,"Last I read, something like 55% of men are circumcised in America. I'm not even in America, but that number worries me greatly. Circumcision numbs the sensitivity of a dude's dick, reducing sexual pleasure. The only real 'advantage' is hygiene.. because apparently most parents would prefer chopping off a part of their child's body rather than having a 10 second conversation on how to clean under your foreskin. Most parents that choose to do this to their sons do it out of a completely outdated religious practice, or because they want their son to be the same as the dad. 

If a kid grows up and decides ""Hey actually, I'd prefer a cut dick over an uncut dick"", that's absolutely okay. But parents doing it to their child, who has no say in the matter, is utterly barbaric and should be outlawed.",unpopularopinion

AITA for Laughing at a Baby CPR Class,"Short but sweet. My spouse and I were expecting and attended a Baby CPR class held at the local hospital for expecting parents.  The instructor began by showing how to locate the proper position to perform CPR compressions.  We were instructed to find the armpit and then measure from the armpit to the middle of the chest. That is the location to perform CPR compressions. Simple enough, right?

Wrong. A person in class immediately raised her hand and asked, ""Sooooooo....do we need to measure from both armpits to the middle, or can we just measure from one?"" This once again proves the old adage that there are no stupid questions, only stupid people who ask questions. The instructor looked at her dumbfounded and I, unable to help myself, let out a single audible chuckle. Nobody else laughed, and I received a few disapproving glares. But come on...that is some funny shizz.  So I ask you good people of Reddit, AITA?

"My daughter was born with microtia, i.e she was born missing an ear. How do I convince my fiancé to stop playing video games and learn asl with me?","She does have normal hearing in the other ear. We were instructed to learn asl by doctors and her audiologist. She may not be a candidate for a cochlear implant or other hearing aides on the affected side. She is 7 months old now and I just can't help but feel we should be farther along than we are, which is currently a vocabulary of about 12 words. I know she is only retaining so much at this young age, but sign language is going to be a huge aide for her. He agreed when I expressed interest in learning but gets annoyed or frustrated when I ask to practice. He works two days a week (fireman). It makes it worse that my mother-in-law says she doesn't need it. I am the only one doing online classes and I can't help but feel discouraged. 

I just wish he could see this as not a chore but something that enriches all of our lives. Personally, I think it is cool and practical. 


Edit: 

Wow this blew up far more than I ever expected. Thank you so much for all the advice, positivity and stories so many of you had shared. To answer some questions, yes he is the biological father and he is otherwise an involved, good father.  We've been advised to learn ASL, or aim to be conversational in it, due to the fact that she solely depends on that one ear. If anything were to happen such as recurrent ear infections, TM rupture, anything, she would be at a disadvantage or it would at least delay her learning and development. 

I plan on following the advice of u/comecloser9 by stepping up my own study/practice methods and routine. I also plan on going to counseling together because as some of you have guessed, there are some underlying communication issues. 

Lastly I do no take issue with the hobby itself, that is fine! I will not be breaking his xbox lol. We all need and have outlets, I just don't like his lack of time management or lack of routine. When I try to work with him on establishing a schedule/routine on off days that incorporates ""gaming time"", like right after he gets home from work or in the evenings after dinner, he calls me the US government and talks about how he can't use his own property in his own house. *sigh*

"Out of town for business, my rental car was flagged as stolen weeks before I rented it resulting in a felony traffic stop involving 8 officers.","I'm in San Francisco for work, and my wife flew out this weekend so we could visit Napa. On the way there, we noticed an officer following us, and as soon as we got off our exit we were pulled over. Three other squad cars blocked the off ramp and pulled their guns on us. They asked me to put our hands in the air, throw the keys out of the window, walk backwards, get on my knees, etc. they did the same with my wife and when we asked why this was happening they didn't answer. 

They put me in the back of the squad car, and read my rights to me. They then told me the car was stolen, to which I responded it was a rental. After some time they confirmed the paper work with the rental company, and cleared the plates. They explained that the company reported it stolen weeks ago when it wasn't returned on time, then never followed up with the police department. The officers explained that the city we were in has one of the highest crime rates in America which was why they had to take it as seriously as they did. We later confirmed that with locals as well as the good old internet.

AITA for removing the stereo faceplate from my car before a long (3+ hours) drive because my GF wouldn't stop muting it to take/make phone calls?,"To preface this i think i might have overreacted because honestly? i can't stand driving. i hate it. but i gotta get places and where i live that means driving.

Little bit of info first, my car is an older car with the stereo that you can change the faceplate, like the buttons and stuff. a few years ago i sent it to a mechanic friend for a tune-up and he put bluetooth in it as a gift.

I occasionally(usually averages out to once or twice every 2-3 months) have to drive several hours to see a specialist for a medical condition I've had since i was born. over the last year or so my GF(R) has started to come with me, which i appreciate very much because i know hospitals bring back a lot of not-good memories for her.

For the Issue at hand. R is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told ""this is important"", or ""i need to hear this"". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.

it drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.

she's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.

Edit: to answer some FAQs, She doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.

i always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, Dr death, YMH, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. I love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when I'm allowed to listen again

i can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.

I've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for THAT long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. I never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.

after thinking about it and how I felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and I feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. I'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by going underwear shopping with my husband,"So my husband's underwear was getting kinda ragged, so we went to the mall to get him some new boxers. He decided to look at some different brands, so we were perusing the boxer selection to see what he wanted to get.

Now my husband likes boxers that have the flap that lets you stick your dick out to piss without having to pull down the waistband. I don't know if there's an official term for it, but I call it the ""dick hole"". While looking at the packages, my husband comments that because the underwear models are wearing black boxers, it makes it difficult to tell if the dick hole exists. He passed the packages to me to see if I could discern if said dick hole is present.

After a few minutes of carefully scrutinizing the crotches of a bunch of underwear models, I turned to my husband and go ""yeah, I don't think these packages have the dick hole"".

Except, it wasn't my husband standing there. It was some old lady, probably a grandma buying underwear for a teenage grandson, with a now horrified look on her face. Which I presume was because she's been watching me stare at crotches and then commenting to her about their dick holes.

I ran away and found my husband not too far away. After telling him what just happened, he laughed at me. I recommended he stick with his current brand.

TL;DR: Looking for dick holes.

Edit - TIL that any crotch hole is called a fly. I always thought ""fly"" referred to the zipper on pants and not the hole itself.  Also, thanks for the gold and silver!

I woke up this morning to officers in my house with their guns drawn. (Louisiana),"This morning I woke up to yelling in my house. I heard ""sheriffs department!"" At first I thought it was my Dad pranking me because when he comes over he always knocks like how cops knock. Anyways I was butt ass naked. I yelled back ""shut up dad!"" because remember, I was sound asleep and to me that was the first plausible explanation that came to mind when I heard that. I wrapped myself in my blanket and walk out to a deputy or whatever with his gun out. Where we live it is pretty quiet and we don't have many neighbors so sometimes when my husband leaves for work in the morning he won't lock it. I'm cool with that, I know tons of people who live around these parts who don't lock their doors either. Anyways he gets to asking me who is in the house, who lives here, what's their names, where are they etc etc. i was half asleep, naked, and scared, so I just answered immediately and honestly. After this little interrogation he then proceeds to tell me that they are looking for someone involved in a domestic dispute a few houses down. He said someone told them our house is an abandoned camp. It used to be a camp in the past, but we have been here since January, and I am outside for hours every single day in my garden. There are baby toys, a trash can that has to be paid for, etc etc outside. I'm not buying it..


He then scolds me saying ""you should really lock your doors ma'am."" As if it was my fault he was in my house with a gun out. So, the domestic neighbor thing... I have one neighbor directly across the highway from me. I know these people, it wasn't them. I have about three neighbors on the same side of the highway as me, but still across the street.. whatever this dispute was it had to have happened almost if not more than a mile away. When I filed a complaint later they would not tell me where exactly this happened. They told me that I should be happy that this officer trespassed in my house because if I had been being held hostage they would have saved me. I asked if he was armed and they said that they didn't know but just assumed he was. They never cleared the house though. If they were so concerned I think that they would have made sure that there wasn't someone else like my son in the house being held hostage, and that maybe I was being forced to say that I was alone.. They are saying that they assumed the worst but did not act like it.


So here's the icing on the cake. They claimed they knocked and nobody responded so they felt they needed to come in. Problem is, I have an incredibly loud dog that alerts me to the slightest sound. She never barked until they started yelling. I also have a baby monitor webcam recording constantly that recorded all of the audio. They never knocked.

Ex-wife's new wife is attempting blackmail,"Background: I transitioned to SAHD for several years when my wife began work as an attorney. We mutually agreed to a divorce a couple years ago and remained close. Because I'd put my own education and career on hold for her, plus a fair amount of debt accrued based on trying to make my ex's plans-on-a-whim work so that I could stay near our kids, I'm starting from rock bottom. I've lived with my in-laws for quite a while as I'm finishing my long-delayed BA while trying to transition out of retail and into better-paying work so I can afford a place of my own. She started a relationship with a woman, ""Judith,"" in the finance industry who offered to mentor me into entering the industry as well. Neither my ex nor I realized that Judith was giving me misleading advice while badmouthing me to my ex and her business contacts. A few months later it came out that Judith was manipulating and physically abusing my ex. My ex ran, but she decided to return after a week. Since then, Judith has made infrequent contact with me via text and email, swinging between attempts at intimidation and playing nice. I currently live in upstate NY with the in-laws. My ex, her wife, and the kids live in MA.

The incident in question happened a couple weeks ago. Judith sent me an email saying that she was giving me 30 days' notice to move out of the in-laws' and into a new place. (I had been open with them, before Judith's behavior came to light and after, about my financial situation and how I was finally saving enough to move out early this year.) If I'm not out by that time, Judith said, she'll tell my in-laws that I was emotionally and sexually abusive to their daughter (my ex) during our marriage.

(EDIT: Her threat was slightly more subtle than that - it was basically, ""Would her parents continue to let you live there if someone told them this? Probably not!"" And in the immediate follow-up email, ""You have 30 days to get out."" So it may not be quite so cut and dry. Otherwise I would have probably just gone straight to a lawyer or the police.)

Because the context is internal to a family situation, I'm not sure how or whether the law on coercion applies. I've briefly looked at the coercion statutes for both NY and MA, as well as the federal statute. I may have been married to an attorney, but I don't know enough myself to even figure out where jurisdiction would lie in this situation. I don't know what steps I should take or when.

The second wall sit, however, was significantly more difficult than i'm used to. There were 5 seconds left, I was boring holes into the clock with my eyes, and my legs were shaking like a senile Chihuahua's. When the clock fiNaLLy hit the one minute mark, I stood up, and came in my pants.

Literally.

It was so bizarre. The trembling started in my groin where the majority of the pain was and then moved in between my legs, and I just came. My dick was.soft the whole time.

Her photos: Me in my suit, me with our God daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. More of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me.

My photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen.

As soon as Sarah saw the pictures I had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. I asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that I hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. I basically told her that I didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. She replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. This conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. I feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, I need to know if I'm in the wrong.

So, am I the asshole here? I... feel like she's overreacting a little. I thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. I didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her.

**EDIT: Info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. The cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. I remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. She prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more**

**EDIT 2** I'm the asshole. And a clueless idiot. From now on I'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. Thank you to all who have judged me, I accept my judgement",AmItheAsshole

"I [32M] sfound out my wife [30/F] is having affair, and she doesn't know I know.","[***UPDATED POST***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d36pwo/update_i_32m_found_out_my_wife_30f_is_having_an/)

Edit: I have words for things now that I didn't before.I threw around the word ""narcissist"" without really knowing what it means. After reading *Becoming the Narcissist's Nightmare* by Shahida Arabi, I am fully aware that she is a narcissist. Ready to go down this rabbit hole? Good. Because I've been waking up at 3am to read it without consequence from my abusive partner. 

People have asked me why I did not get out sooner, or why I didn't realize she was not a good mom sooner, even judging me; saying my emotions were getting in the way of seeing her motherhood. Well, here are some answers to that. I had/have something called Trauma Brain, and it started from childhood. My mother was extremely emotionally manipulative and a narcissist herself... she would be overly controlling and critical, throwing in overt and covert put downs and cruel verbal abuse, in addition to attempting to control everything I did. ""You don't have it as bad as I did, you wimp."" ""You could be so much better than you are if you worked as hard as I do"" ""You're going to that crazy school where they teach you the wrong things. Come home and stop letting them poison you.""

From the book: ""For those who have been abused as children by narcissistic parents, trauma literally changes the structure of a child's developing brain which is extremely malleable during that time. Dr. Martin Teicher (2006) pointed out the growing evidence that verbal abuse in childhood can change the way a brain is wired... There has been corresponding research that confirms that parental verbal aggression can in fact lead to changes in the brain."" (pg 160)

Also from the book: ""For those of us who have experienced narcissitic abuse since childhood, many of us are familiar with the trauma bonds that can keep us locked in the vicious cycle of meeting and mating with narcissists."" (11)

That second quote is the first line of the introduction. I was hooked. 

There are biochemical bonds that are formed, especially in children, with victims to abusive people. 

""When trauma survivors encounter stimuli that remind them of their trauma... the amygdala (which processes emotions) reacts as if they are experiencing the same event."" (163)

In fact, the biochemical bond is so strong it can even affect memory in a phenomenon called ""abuse amnesia"". The reason that I can't always remember exactly what hurtful things my partner said to me is because my brain literally programmed it out. 

The chemicals my brain associated with my partner were: Oxytocin, Dopamine, Cortisol, Adrenaline Norepiephrine, and Serotonin. You may have heard of some of these: Oxy, the ""feel good"" drug, the drug labeled ""Dope"" - the drug that rewards us for certain behaviors, Cortisol, the stress hormone, adrenaline and norepinephrine as the ""fight or flight"" hormones, and serotonin is the mood regulator. With an abusive partner, these rise and fall at any given moment. This leads to what is called a ""Trauma Bond"" - the result of intense emotional experiences that happen with our abusers. (162-175)

Abused people are basically kept strung out on certain types of drugs and hormones for their entire relationship. My abuser has never ever had to show her true self because with narcissists, there is no true self. They rely on masks and fake emotions to get their way in any situation. 

""What abuse, Throwaway? It can't really be that bad."" 

There is a cycle of narcissistic abuse, and it all starts with Trauma Bonding. The cycle is Idealize, Devalue, Discard, Destroy, Hoover. The Trauma bonds are located in the entire cycle, see if you can spot them. 

Idealize means your partner fawns over you, often called ""love-bombing"". It's a honeymoon period with occasional insights into their narcissistic nature that good people often chalk up to human error. See, the narcissist only looks for targets who are prime candidates for emotional manipulation. My wife and I dated for three months before we decided to get married. She also made us having sex extremely frequent and completely mind-blowing, as that was something I hadn't experienced before and (we'll get to this later) she had a LOT of practice. This idealization also causes most normal people to open up and be vulnerable with their partner, but this is just fuel for the narcissist's next phase:

Devalue means that they will begin to pick on your insecurities, hopes and dreams, and character. Once you're ""hooked"" on the Dopamine and the Oxytocin, everything is exploitable. The narcissist will employ covert and overt strategies of putting you down and making you feel worthless. I experience this with harsh ""jokes"" - ""My husband is such an idiot he forgot to unplug the coffee machine. He probably needed more coffee!"" Oh, yeah, this happens in public too. I also got overt put-downs. ""You wouldn't have lost the tickets if you weren't so stupid. You can't focus on anything, you need to get your shit together."" ""Why don't you ever think about me? You're so selfish."" She also attacks my support networks, calling my friend my ""butt-buddy"", and bombing my phone with text messages whenever I'm at his house (once a week to gather with friends and hang out). -Even typing that made my cortisol rise, thinking about how my self-care could be interpreted as selfishness when it is NOT. Your value plummets, setting you up for the next phase: 

Discard is when the partner throws you to the curb, literally or figuratively. There is a moment when the narcissist gets tired of the ""supply"" (The attention an admiration of their ""trophies""... we say trophies because the narcissist only views people as objects that are extensions of themselves, like a purse or umbrella), and when the narcissist is tired of the supply, it will move on to a new one. In my relationship this looks like ""I'm done with you."" followed by excessive doting on our kids (her new supply). However, she gets worn out with them even faster, because while I can hide my emotions, the kids cannot. The other day one of the boys accidentally kneed the older one in the nose, and he started crying. She told him he has an ugly cry, and then he cried harder because he was called ugly and then my wife said ""What? I didn't say you were ugly, I said you had an ugly cry"". I cradled him in my arms and told him mommy didn't mean it. She dismissed us all and went to go chat with her boy toy in her bed. Her favorite words, each and every day, are ""I'm done!"" Then she emotionally abandons us, sometimes for days on end. This is another element of trauma, and this is what I'm worried about for our kids. What happens when this is the norm when I'm not there, and I can't help organize the pieces when trauma happens... I say pieces because trauma is literally a fracturing of the brain. Oh yeah, did I mention that I've been relegated to sleep in the guest bedroom... because I went and helped a friend with a woodworking project after the kids were asleep?

Then, destroy. The narcissist will use their posse to destroy the character of the abused person, making it seem like they are the crazy person. Fortunately, in my situation, I have the support network where she does not yet. It takes time for her to establish, and she hasn't had enough of that yet. So, it's only 2-3 people right now. 

Then, the most significant piece for me, ""hoovering"". ""This is when the narcissist, like a hoover vacuum, attempts to suck you back in to the traumatic vortex of the relationship. Usually this occurs when the narcissist loses control of the victim and wants to regain control at the very moment the victim attempts to move forward with his or her life."" (51) I'll update the post with the way she tries to hoover back in after she's served. In the past, it's been with sex. After the conference, she had sex with me every night for a week. Probably because she'd already hooked up with her current fling. I had no idea. 

Now, what specific elements of abuse are we looking at?

Buckle up folks because it's about to get very real for some of you. If your partner exhibits one or two of these, it may be NPD, or it may be something else. But if they exhibit 7, 8, or 9... Then DM me and we can talk about how the book says you can get out of that abusive relationship.  

Toxic and abusive behaviors exhibited by someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder: 

1. Being overly critical and controlling towards their partners, covertly and overtly putting them down through cruel verbal abuse - name calling, harsh insults disguised as jokes, contemptuous remarks about victim's appearance, lifestyle, line of work, or support networks. 

2. Being physically and/or sexually abusive - coercing into sexual situations you aren't comfortable with, or even threatening to leave or ruin the victim's life if they do not comply with their wishes. 

3. Engaging in Hot/Cold behavior (alternating through different hormones and drugs). This is the cycle of idealize, devalue, discard. They love you completely or they hate you. 

4. Controlling every aspect of the partner's life - isolate the partner from family and friends and sabotage important life events or goals and aspirations. 

5. Stonewalling into silence: any concerns about the relationship are met with silent treatment, ""I'm done"", or disappearance. 

6. Triangulating Victims with other love interests, comparing the victim to previous lovers and relationships. 

7. Gaslighting - diminishing the abuse so that it doesn't feel real, deflecting accountability. 

8. Smear Campaings - Slander the victim's character and reputation so that the abuse victim is left with no support network. They project their own bad behavior onto the victim. 

9. Blameshifting - projection of malignant traits onto the victim so that they seem like the crazy person, and the aggressor appears just fine. 

That's all her to a T.

So, there you go. That's why I think she's an unfit mother and that's why it was so hard to realize I needed to leave. I had set a boundary (don't fuck other guys) and when she broke it, I realized all the other stuff that was off. Narcissists don't have boundaries, and kids need boundaries, among all the other crazy emotional abuse they'll be subjected to with her. 


UPDATE: This week has been exhausting. I went to visit three lawyers and contracted with one. The papers are being worked on. It will take at least 24 hours to process, then they'll talk with me about a plan to serve her. 

You might be wondering how I secured a lawyer. Well, I had not really had ties with my family. My dad and her are always at odds, and after one time that he didn't follow one of her rules with one of the boys, she lost it at him. She convinced me he was the toxic one and that he was bad for our relationship. So I hadn't REALLY talked with him in like a year, even though I had convinced her to let him come visit once, she didn't say a word to him the whole time. 

I didn't know where else to go so I called him up. He picked up immediately, excited to hear from me, and this was our conversation: 

""Dad, are you alone? And you promise not to freak out?"" 

""Yes. What's the matter son?"" 

""...my wife is having an affair."" 

""Oh Throwaway... I'm so sorry."" 

My parents had gotten a divorce when I was 18. He really was sorry. I continued:

""Dad I'm sorry."" 

""Son you didn't do anything wrong."" 

At this point, I can't hold it all together anymore. I lose it, completely, in car, at the parking lot of the grocery store. I haven't sobbed like that since I was a child. I'm crying right now as I type this. 

""...Yes I did, I'm so sorry. I've been awful to you.""

At this point, he starts crying too. And I sob more. 

""I'm just sorry you're in pain, Throwaway. I'll tell you this so you don't feel like you have to keep saying you're sorry... I forgive you, but you haven't done anything to wrong me."" 

That's what love looks like. I'd been missing that feeling this whole time. This understanding that love makes sacrifices; doesn't focus on itself. And my dad has always loved me.  

Then he told me he'd pay for whatever I needed, no matter how he had to do it. 


When this is all over, I'll have a proper update probably in a new post. I'm so tired of pretending, but I need to hold out for another week. My little ones, my conversations with my dad, my close friends and the support from y'all keep me going. I hope to have another update by next Friday. Wish me luck. 

Also how long has there been a typo in the title?? Sheesh. 



TL;DR: stuck in a relationship with a cheater. 

Throwaway for obvious reasons and details changed, Yadda yadda. 

It all started a few months ago. 

There was a continuing education experience that I was looking into attending for my job. However, when I brought it up, my wife expressed interest in also going because it was not only something she was interested in, but she hadn't been able to go in years because of our kids [2 boys, under 5 years]. I know moms work really hard to care for their kiddos especially in those younger years. I work full-time so the moment I get home I take the kid's so she can get some rest. 

Anyway this request seemed difficult but I decided I'd put my neck out for her. After all, she deserves to grow too, right? So I spend my proverbial chips asking my boss if she can go instead of me. Surprisingly, he's actually ok with it after our frank and candid discussion, so she's able to go. I spend the week mostly home from work except when kids are at preschool, take care of the house and kids, and it's an awesome week. The boys and I get really close, playing all kinds of games and solidifying the bedtime routine... 

Saturday rolls around when my wife is getting back, and she's over the moon. It seemed like the conference was really good for her. She came back with a lot of stories, as she loves to tell stories about her events. She informs me she's so happy she has friends she can talk to now and mentions that she'd like to go hang out with them now that she knows them. We live in a suburb, and they can all go hang out in the city together. I'm very excited for her as I haven't seen her this happy in a while. She typically experiences bouts of depression so this was amazing. 

Fast forward a bit. She is getting ready to go hang out with them and she comes out from getting ready and she looks **cuuuuuute**. Little tank top, shorts that make her booty pop. I comment and just says thanks. She'll be back in a while. 

She gets back and I ask how it went. ""Good."" 

""...who did you hang out with?"" "" I don't know, people? You don't know them."" 

I brushed it off, but notes that she didn't tell me any stories. She always does that. 

She does this three more times. I start getting suspicious. She's getting distant and she's always on her phone. I start to put two and two together. 

Well, I see she's on google hangout a lot. We know each other's passwords for accountability, and hers is already up on my phone whenever I log in (but I don't often log in). I start to think maybe she's cheating. Then I have to convince myself she's not. She wouldn't do that. We've been married 9 years, we have two kids. She's over in the city right now with her friends, it's just a chill time to be herself. Right? 

I tried so hard but I couldn't stop. I logged into google hangouts and there it was. One of the guys she met at the conference and her was at the top of the message list. All their correspondence was right there. 

It was vile.

Things my wife and I had never said to each other. They were rendezvousing, just the two of them, to fuck. They were meeting up right now, at the ""usual place"". 

And when they weren't fucking, they were sexting like crazy. My kids were in the room while she was sending those messages. I almost threw up. My heart rate was at 175 at least. I felt every possible emotion a person could feel while sill having to care for the boys: make dinner, do baths, get ready for bed. I told them I was feeling sad, but not because of them, and that daddy might need a little more patience. They were amazing. 

That was 6 days ago. 

I've had to pretend, for 6 days, that nothing is wrong. 

I contacted a lawyer and I am filing for divorce. However, the retainer fee is way, WAY more than I or anyone in my family has. 

So I have to pretend everything is ok while I find this money. 

A couple nights ago she asked if I wanted to have sex and I said I had a headache. Then I *actually* was sick to my stomach and almost vomited again. I can't have sex with her as the guy may not be clean and I don't want a VD. Plus... it hurts to think about how she could do that. What did I do wrong?

I have no idea what to do. She's keeping up the charade just fine, but I'm cracking as time goes on. What should I do? I have to protect my boys from her... she's not stable. Pathological liar, inappropriate conduct, and the kicker? 

We're in the middle of marriage therapy. 

What should I do?

Edit: People are asking why I am concerned about my kids. Good question.

When I was 22 I met her at a convention... much like this one. Huh. It turned out she only lived like half an hour from me, so we started hanging out. Found out that until recently, she had a fiancee. No big deal... that's totally normal for a 20 year old to have gotten engaged and ended it, right? She said he cheated on her. [Press X to doubt]

She showed up after we'd been dating for a bit with a suicide note in her hand.

I took her inside and from that night onward, I didn't leave her side. I wanted to make sure she was safe. She would lock herself in the bathroom with razor blades and cut herself.

Since the beginning of our relationship, and after we got married, she'd said she felt depression and thoughts of suicide at least five or six times.

She also has absolutely no impulse control (obviously), she is a narcissist (everything is someone else's fault, never her own), and she doesn't have any emotionally healthy behaviors with the children (yells instead of communicates, tells them ""I'm done"" instead of parenting and just leaves it to me).

My kids won't got to bed unless I put them down. I wake up with them every morning, and when they wake up in the middle of the night. I make and feed them breakfast, she sometimes makes them dinner (like she did last night) but usually she asks for fast food. Which is unfortunate because she does cook really well.

All that and she lies about everything.

She's unstable and inconsistent, and kids need emotional stability and consistency.",relationship_advice
"LPT: If you have an old picture of someone, give it to them.","If you're like me, you have boxes or albums full of old photos and quite a few stored digitally. These pictures are just as precious (if not more so) to the people in them as they are to you. You wouldn't want them to go the rest of their lives without seeing them, would you?

This can be a daunting project, if you have a ton of photos, but it's very rewarding too. You can instantly make your friends' and family's faces light up as they see your photos and remember ""the old days.""

What you'll get in return is hearing old stories you've forgotten about (or never knew) and the appreciation of the people you've photographed over the years.

I hosted a party once and excused myself for a moment to dig up a couple old photos I had of two of the attendees. One of them brought his girlfriend and I showed it to her first. She had never seen a picture of her boyfriend that was more than a few years old. They were both elated.

I would suggest doing this privately (as opposed to randomly posting it on their Facebook wall, for example). Let them decide if it belongs on social media in order to avoid any potential embarrassment.

EDIT: Obviously, there will be some situations where this isn't appropriate. Always keep other people's feelings in mind in this and other situations. (Bonus LPT for ya.)

WIBTA for not wanting to feed my ex-wife?,"My ex and I have two boys (7 and 11) and we have 50-50 custody. Every Thursday she comes to my house to pick them up for her time. I noticed more and more food was gone, but not for sure. I was able to confirm that food was going missing because someone drank my last can of Ginger Ale. I asked my sons' sitter if he knew anything about it and he said my ex drank it. I was confused. Apparently, when my ex comes to pick up them up, she'll start making a snack for herself like she lives there. I thought about it and want it to stop.

The issue is that she is unemployed and has no money. I believe she is hungry. It's not about the money or cleaning up after yourself - it's about boundaries.

&#x200B;

EDIT - I do pay her child support, $300 a month. I make 90K a year and she makes 45K a year. However, I pay for the kids' tuition and cover their insurance. I believe that my ex is barely breaking even at the end of each month and lives paycheck-to-paycheck. She lost her job back in August and just found something in October so that fucked her finances up. 

That's not my problem though.  

My problem is that she just welcomes herself to my food. Literally, the stuff she eats is the food that I buy for myself. For example, my diet ginger ale. It pisses me off that I come home and want to have a nice cold ginger ale with my dinner only to find that the last few were drank. And when she uses a plate, she'll rinse it off but doesn't dry it or even put it in the fucking dish washer.",AmItheAsshole

Yes I know it's half not step

So 29 years ago my mother had a at home birth and out popped her only child, me. When filling out all work she refused to give any info on my father so according to the government I don't have a dad. Life growing up wasn't hard my mom was a doctor so financially we were stable my grandma would take care of me and it was overall nice however my mom refused to ever talk about my dad all I knew is he was ""a tall son of a bitch"".

5 years ago I met the girl of my dreams. Long black hair a lovely face and an amazing body. She was the sweetest thing and seemed to understand me. She was 19 I was 24 but age didn't effect us. We met at a coffee shop she worked at I would come around 7, when they were about to close get coffee and talk with her as she closed shop. Soon enough I asked for her number she told me she wasn't aloud to give private info to customers so I waited till they closed walked out with her then asked her again. She agreed and we started talking more. Things went up from there we started dating I got close with her family she got close to mine and a year ago I proposed to her at the coffee shop we met at. To my joy she said yes. 

Wedding planning is a bitch I hated it it took about 4 months and during that time my mom got cancer and was put in a hospital. December 2018 we got married, skyped call the whole thing for my mom. And January 2019 my wonderful mother passed away. 

My wonderful supporting now wife was amazing throughout this all, we held the funeral and she kept me going and we held the funeral. This is where life took a turn. We were cleaning out the attic of her house preparing everything to sell. No big deal. Thats when I found a photo album from when my mom was in collage. I flipped through it and noticed something, a guy commonly with my mom..... Was my wifes dad. Shocked and stunned I approached my wife with it and she said we should talk to her dad about it. We go to him and he tells us about how he dated a girl in collage got her pregnant couldn't handle it and ""dissapeared"" to a different part of town. We explain to him how thats my mother and thats where this story leaves off, I'm grossed but my wife and I talked about it. Were going to try and stay together and never talk about this again.

Tl;dr: I had no dad met a girl married her found out her dad was my dad

Edit: 
Half not step thank you comments

Right now we aren't planning on having kids well cross that bridge when we get there

We don't even really want to do any testing to confirm or deny it we have all the evidence we need we're just going to pretend that the photo album didn't exist and pray it doesn't hurt us later on in life

Okay a lot of people have asked my mom was in and out of the hospital before the wedding and about 1-2 months before the wedding my mom was permanently in the hospital

They had called but not anything in person and out wedding wasn't one with a lot of pictures it was a few friends and family in a small church in the moment thing, the wedding was skype called for me mom but after it her and I talked for a tiny bit then we hung up as we continued on.

I found it disgusting that reddit (the community) was so quick to condemn a man facing unevidenced and uncorroborated sexual assault accusations,"We have Kavanaugh, and we have his accuser. His accuser has so far provided no evidence and found no one to back up her story and can remember no further details of the event, whilst the accused is able to reasonably refute the accusations. Yet despite everything, the reddit community was so quick to condemn him and portray him as guilty.

It gets even more repulsive. The community then decides to attack Kavanaugh's temperament during the hearing. As if the anonymous commenters would remain unhurt and un-angry and un-tearful if they had a 20yr reputation destroyed by an unevidenced sexual assault accusation and would not cry if their family had been hurled slime and sent death threats. How dare they

So why has the presumption of innocence, the burden of proof, due process etc etc gone out the window? Because Kavanaugh is a Republican",unpopularopinion

[TX] I am the non-custodial parent of a 3yo whose mom just went to prison and is now living in a drug den. [FINAL UPDATE!],"Dear friends, its been 57 days since my first post looking for advice, and my what an [adventure](https://redd.it/5nz4yw) it has been! You people have been as big a part of this as our own family (who knew that kids tugged at reddit's heartstrings so much!), and as promised, here we are at the exciting conclusion:


* My lawyer called in a personal favor to the judge to expedite the final orders hearing as much as possible, it only took three weeks from the temporary hearing to today when we had our final; which apparently is warp speed versus the norm. 
* The mom's mom made a huge personal sacrifice by testifying, but she did, and painted a truly sad picture of what things were like before we came into the mix. We even discovered that now, while she is in prison, the mom is pregnant again and used meth intravenously the whole time until she was locked up in December.  So when she pops this one out and the baby's poop tests positive for narcotics, the state is likely to take it away. Addiction is a cruel mistress. We have gotten close to grandma and we plan to keep her close. She has always taken care of him when she was able to and really put her neck out on the line to look out for her grandson's well being. 
* We were granted **ALL** of our terms, everything! This includes a discretionary visitation claus, that basically says me and my son have to mutually agree to allow her to visit. I will not be unfair to the mom or abuse this flexibility, but it gives me a lot more leverage to require that she is clean and set healthy boundaries. 
* And here we are, a new and very happy family of three and we love the shit out of our little man (even though he is for some reason screaming about Jurassic World right now). We aren't perfect, and we are winging it at best, but we are going to bust our asses forever to give our son the life he deserves.

11 Minutes,"A cop was patrolling late at night in a well-known lover's spot, famous for all obscene activities. He sees a couple in a car, with the interior light brightly glowing.

The cop carefully approaches the car to get a closer look.
Then he sees a young man behind the wheel, reading a computer magazine. He immediately notices a young woman in the rear seat, knitting. Puzzled by this surprising situation, the cop walks to the car and gently raps on the driver's window.

The young man lowers his window. ""Uh, yes, officer?""

The cop says: ""What are you doing?""

The young man says: ""Well Officer, I'm reading a magazine.""

Pointing towards the young woman in the back seat the cop says: ""And her, what is she doing?""

The young man shrugs: ""Sir, I believe she's knitting a pullover sweater.""

Now, the cop is totally confused.. A young couple, alone, in a car, at night in a Lover's lane… and nothing obscene is happening!

The cop asks: ""What's your age, young man?"" 

The young man says ""I'm 22, sir.""

The cop asks: ""And her…what's her age?""

The young man looks at his watch and replies: 

""She'll be 18 in 11 minutes.""",Jokes

"Overheard my [26M] fiancé [24F] tell her friend on the phone that she ""settled for being with me,"" and that marrying me was her ""last resort.""","

Update 2: Just did one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. Today after breakfast I told her we should ""sit down and talk."" She was hesitant, but I said it was important. We went to the living room and she said to me ""I already know what this is about."" My post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under ""popular."" Of course the water works started happening right away. I told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. Through her tears, she said ""I was just joking, I wasn't serious."" She then went on saying stuff like ""I love you, I love you."" I told her I can't be in a marriage where my S/O doesn't love me the same way I love them. She tried to tell me that she loved me and that I meant something to her. But it was all bullshit. She said she ""didn't want to lose me."" I told her I don't think this marriage was the right decision. And from there I basically told her it was over. I told her I knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. For all those wondering, we have no kids, and I pay fully for the apartment we live in, and I own almost everything we have other then her clothes. I even pay for her car. So after all of this she'll have little to nothing left. Before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, I've never been so happy with a decision I've made in my life. After that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me ""Fuck you."" She started screaming at me, telling me ""you just can't end things like that."" I told her I could do whatever I wanted, and that's when she became very hostile. She screamed at me saying, ""You're the fucking worst relationship I've ever been in. You think I can't find someone again?"" ""Do you think you'll ever from someone as good as me? You're a fucking idiot [my name]."" She grabbed her bag and phone, and said ""I'm leaving!"" Before slamming the door behind her. At that moment I felt like I was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you'd find of TV. I sat down on the couch and cried, and I'm still crying as I type this up. It's both happy and sad tears, and I knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. She never loved me, it was obvious. Our relationship only went one way, and I feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier I live in California, and I'm gonna start the process to annul our marriage. Tomorrow, I'm gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that's essentially where they belong. (I'm not throwing out her stuff. Just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. All of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and I know my life will certainly improve as a result.

Edit/Update: Thanks everyone for the kind words! Really has made me feel a lot better! Going to be talking to her soon. Also, I noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, I understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn't. I've been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. Not really used to calling her my ""wife"" yet. Also I used an old alt since she uses Reddit. Anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the Internet can care so much about a person they don't even know. I'm going to talk to her today. I will be updating you all soon after.

Edit: Meant to put wife in the title but now I can't change it.

Basically the title. I overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while I was passing the bedroom. This friend is in a serious relationship. My wife then said to her, ""Sweetie, remember it's your choice. Don't settle for just anyone. That's the mistake I made. Who knows who else I could of had. [My name] was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up."" Hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. Does she even love me? Why am I being treated as a second base? 

Am I being dramatic and overreacting? I haven't said anything about it since. I honestly don't know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.",relationship_advice

AITA for kicking out a couple who brought their baby and toddler to my wedding because I wanted a child-free event?,"This couple I'm not very close with but the wife is a long-time family friend so I felt that I should invite her. To be clear, all of my invitations stated that there were to be no children at this wedding. But she and her husband showed up with their infant and toddler (who I think is like 3-4). 

At the actual wedding ceremony, I let it slide. I was preoccupied for obvious reasons. I also thought that maybe they planned not to attend the reception or to have someone pick the kids up before it started. (My niece, who was our flower girl, and a few other kids who had to be at the wedding for one reason or another we're getting picked up/dropped off after the ceremony ended). 

Anyway the reception rolls around (I'm fast forwarding through irrelevant details about the wedding but it was beautiful and everything went as smoothly as could be expected). The couple comes and, lo and behold, they still have their children.

I had many other guests and didn't really feel like dealing with it so I asked our event planner to go over to them and discuss whether someone was picking up the child as the reception (and wedding, frankly!) were not supposed to have children. 

I mean, everyone was drinking and loud and rowdy and  a crying child and another little one running around was not part of the plan. (The infant  already had to be taken out once during the wedding ceremony because of fussiness and the toddler was, from what I could see, already appearing cranky). 

My event planner went to talk to the couple. I could tell they were arguing with my event planner though so I went over to help him. I think they thought I came to rescue them because they started going on about how rude my event planner was. I explained that I had actually sent him over to discuss the children. I reiterated that the event was child-free and said that I had stated so clearly on my invitations. 

The wife gave a sort of apology and then assured me that they were capable of minding their own children to make sure they didn't get in the way of anything. I said that wasn't really the point. That's when my now-husband comes over and he and the other woman's husband begin going back and forth and things got a little heated. 

Finally I snapped and said that they just needed to go, which, thankfully they did without much more noise. Still, the whole scene was incredibly embarrassing which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. 

I really hate that my wedding day had to be somewhat marred by this incident. According to my mother, everyone was talking about it and I guess enjoying a little dramatic entertainment. 

Was I the a-hole for making them leave?

**Edit 1: Wow um this kind of blew up out of nowhere. Thank you all so much for the feedback. What I've gotten from this is that most people think that the couple was rude. There are also a select few who feel that it's assholish to have a kid-free wedding at all which is...interesting.**

**By way of an update, I have now learned that a few family members felt that it was inappropriate of me to kick out the couple. (The wife apparently is still angry about getting kicked out and the husband is FALSELY telling people that we threatened to call the cops on them). No one has said anything directly to me though.**

**Anyway the feedback here has helped me not to feel guilty about that and just realize that not everyone has the same ideas about tact and manners.** 

**Edit 2: Well apparently this went somewhat viral and has now been in articles on Fox News, DailyMail, and Yahoo News. Many thanks to those in the comments who let me know!

AITA for being angry my parents left my siblings more inheritance than me because I'm more successful?,"My mother passed away last month (my late father's already been gone for 2 years) and my siblings and after a pretty hectic month, we have finally sorted most things out and are getting back to our usual lives.

The situation is this: my mother's estate has about 300k worth of assets, which while she was living, we never discussed how it would be distributed. I didn't really care since I'm financially well off and make near 100k in the business field. My younger brother works in entertainment and earns about 45k while our youngest has autism spectrum disorder, lives independently but works a minimum wage job and relies on a lot of support to get by.

My mother's will stated her assets would be split up so that I get 20k, my brother gets 80k, and my ASD sister gets 200k (distributed over 10 years according to her will). We've met up to discuss this and my siblings have no issues with their share, but I have some resentment for how I'm receiving so much less because I stayed in school longer to get a career that makes more.

Her will states it pretty clearly, and I kind of expected my mother to give more support to my siblings who need it more, but in my head I was thinking of a 20-30-50 split.  6.7% feels so unfair to me.",AmItheAsshole

"[UPDATE] I haven't seen or heard from my biological father in 21 years, and I received a phone call saying that they need the next of kin to make decisions.","So I wanted to thank everyone who commented and replied on the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8azu76/i_havent_seen_or_heard_from_my_biological_father/?ref=share&ref_source=link) as it really helped me feel better about the decision to relinquish my rights as his power of attorney.

On Sunday, my aunt had called to let me know that when she visited him and asked if he wanted to see his children, and he tried to open his eyes and blinked several times so she insinuated that it was a yes. To be honest, I only agreed to go because I knew I had to do this for myself so that I wouldn't live with the possibility of regret that I did or did not see him in his dying days (even though I know I don't owe him anything). It was also an hour and a half drive from where I currently live in Louisiana.

So when I went to go see my dad, the doctor wanted to speak with me, my aunt and uncle first about what to do and who's going to have the power of attorney. I told them I wanted to withdraw my responsibility and then the doctor said that I can give it to someone else. I gave my aunt and uncle that option and they said they were in the same boat as I was and didn't know what to do either. If none of us decides to hold that responsibility, then the decision will ultimately go to the State and it'll be up to them with the next steps of care. I also asked if there would be a financial burden to whoever becomes his power of attorney. The doctor said she wasn't sure but she believes that he has Medicare/Medicaid, but anything not covered by them would be the responsibility of the power of attorney. 

So I finally go in to see him with my aunt and uncle and he just seems kind of unresponsive. He has very little brain function and is pretty much equivalent to a person who has gone through several strokes. My aunt was trying to wake him up to open his eyes, and he slightly fluttered his eyelids. They told me to talk to him. So I asked them if I could have some privacy because I really didn't know what to say. I just kind of stood there for a second after they left and just talked about myself. I felt like I was in an interview or something. I was just like ""hey dad..... it's liveliftlove"" and he turned his heads towards me and opened his eyes a little bigger, but I'm not sure what brain functions are still working (doctor didn't have MRI on hand so we weren't sure what brain functions weren't hypoxic) and I just started talking about myself. I told him I'm turning 27 year this, I've gone to college, have 2 degrees, don't have any kids, have a side business, and am currently living in Louisiana. Then, I said something along the lines of  ""I know it's been 21 years since you've seen or heard from me..."" and then I started choking up because I knew what I wanted to say next but I had a difficult time saying it. A part of me just wanted to get super angry and say ""I turned out okay without you or maybe because you left I became who I am. You had nothing to do with raising me and the successes I have achieved to this day"". Ultimately I said I forgave him and that I hope he finds peace and happiness in the next lifetime or whatever it is that he believes him. I saw tears come out of his eyes, so I'm not sure if he heard me and was reacting or if it was just because he had all of these tubes in and out of him and he was having some sort of gag reflex. It was just kind of hard to recognize him because the majority of his face had something covering it with the ventilating and feeding tubes. I still felt like I was talking to a stranger, but I just hope he knew I was there and that it made him feel better. I don't feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulder or like a sigh of relief. I'm actually pretty okay with whatever happened, and I know I won't have any regrets with that part of my life. 

Apparently, he has a group of friends that was also there and they all looked at me and was like ""omg, she looks just like the mom."" I got annoyed after we visited, and we all sat together in the waiting room talking and trying to find out more information and they just kept telling me I'm his child, I need to do this, this, and that and to force my brother to come see him. I just didn't say anything because I didn't want to be disrespectful. In my head I really just wanted to scream ""FUCK YOU and FUCK YOUR OPINIONS, because you guys got to know him more than I ever had and it's not anyone's fault but HIS that he chose not to be a part of my life so don't you DARE tell me what I should and should not do."" But we found out that they got in touch with the wife in Vietnam and she's trying to come over here to visit and she has been given the power of attorney, so he's currently on full code until they can get her a visa/sponsorship over here (which he'll probably pass before that can even happen).

My mom's defibrillator malfunctioned and shocked her 40+ times at 600V. The doctor's all denied responsibility for the cause. It put my parents hundreds of thousands of dollars into medical debt.,"Location: US. Original incident happened in Indiana.

I should first and foremost say that this happened about 10 years ago, so at this point I doubt it's possible to do anything about the situation.

&#x200B;

When I was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. She thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. This led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. It turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

&#x200B;

It could be some form of PTSD I suffered from seeing my mom nearly die in my arms, but her defibrillator almost triggered again today and it brought back those memories. She told me that her and my dad tried to pinpoint who was responsible (the company who made the wires, the defibrillator company, etc.) but all of the doctors she saw denied responsibility.

&#x200B;

Is there anything they can do at this point? I feel like she suffered so much and was given absolutely zero compensation for what happened. It makes me furious knowing how much pain she went through and nothing was done about it.",legaladvice

The notion that you should not complain because somebody has it worse is ridicolous.,"If you kill time on social media sites, you might eventually stumble across a collage of pictures and quotes. Usually the there are two pictures contrasting issues that normal people experience in our relatively safe western societies, and the life of depressed people, poor people in wartorn societies, soldiers in combat etc...

&#x200B;

The gist is always the same: stop complaining, because you actually have it pretty good compared to these other lives that you never have to live trough. Sounds reasonable, and certainly there is value to showing how bad life is for the unfortunate, but to say that I should not complain? Fuck off.

&#x200B;

First off, where do you draw the line of ""right to complain begins after this point""? Either it's arbitrary, or there really is only one person who get's that right. Sorry raped, beaten and starving child, but raped, beaten and starving child who also grew up without parents have it worse, so no right to complain for you.

&#x200B;

Second, Complaining releases stress. We feel better after letting out some steam. Nobody who has their best friend move to another town actually believes themselves to feel worse than a soldier being forced to shoot his friend who inhaled mustard gas, does that somehow invalidate the sadness and anger we feel, and does it mean that we should not get to release that somehow? ""Just ignore your human impulse"" that's quite a lot to ask for. Everybody has a breaking point after all.

&#x200B;

Like it or not, everybody should complain when they feel upset enough to complain about it. That's human. Expecting things to change because you complain however, and never taking actions to change your shitty situation, THAT is something that people should stop doing.",unpopularopinion
UPDATE: I [22F] just found out my boyfriend [27M] has been having sex with me when I'm sleeping after I've taken sleeping pills.,"[Previous post can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bovqbj/i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27f_has_been/) but the TL;DR is in the title. I have really bad insomnia and often take pills that knock me out completely. I'm pretty much dead to the world when I take them. Recently, about 2 weeks ago, I found out that my boyfriend would have sex with me while I was knocked out despite me saying that I wasn't up for sex before I fell asleep. I woke up that day because I was feeling unwell for different reasons and hadn't taken my insomnia pills. He didn't see what was wrong with him doing what he did.

&#x200B;

Now for the update. after I found out what happened, I went to my older brother's house and have been staying with him since. I'm so incredibly lucky to have him. It was from his house that I made the last post. After that post, I was replying to the comments until I fell asleep. The majority of them told me that my boyfriend was raping me and that I need to break up with him and report him to the police. That was something I didn't wasn't to have to do. When I woke up in the morning, I had almost 600 more replies and I got really overwhelmed and had to step back and decide for myself what I was going to do. So that is exactly what I did.

&#x200B;

I had decided that everyone deserves a second chance. I wanted to talk to my boyfriend explain why I wasn't okay with what happened and why it was wrong. I went into that conversation with every intention of staying with him and giving him a second chance.

&#x200B;

So I called him over a little over a week ago so we could talk. I started to explain everything to him and why I had to go away for a while. The conversation was going okay at the beginning. But then it took a turn. As soon as I brought up the fact that I wold him no to sex before I feel asleep but he did it anyway, he kinda snapped. He started yelling. He started throwing things. He got scary violent. Telling me that he knew I was insinuating that he had raped me. Saying I was accusing him of something very serious. I hadn't said to him that he had raped me. I hadn't even gotten the chance to tell him that I was going to give him another chance.

&#x200B;

Then things took another turn. In my last post, people were accusing me of attention seeking. I don't want to come off that way so I am not going to disclose what happened. I'm still trying to process everything and wondering how I could be so wrong about a person.

&#x200B;

I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me on my last post. You have no idea how much it meant to me to have your support, especially when my boyfriend was trying to convince me I was the one who was wrong. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you guys. I was wrong. But I think what happened would have happened regardless of what decision I had made. Maybe it was better that way because now I know for sure. I don't know what is going to happen in the future, but for now I'm living with my brother and trying to get my life back in order.

&#x200B;

Again, thank you.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some people have asked of he is now my ex. I guess I didn't really directly say that he is. We are no longer together. And never will be again. Even if I decided to get back together with him for some crazy reason, my brother will never let that happened after what transpired that day.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: It's come up a lot. People are asking to telling me to report him tit he police. My brother did report him. Another thing people keep asking is what happened. Call me an attention seeker if you want. I don't care anymore. What I left out was that when he got violent, he tried to rape me. If my brother hadn't heard him and pulled him off of me, he would have succeeded. It's so embarrassing, not just that I was almost taped but that my brother found me like that.",relationship_advice

I (24/m) have been going out with my girlfriend (22/f) for just over 3 years. We do not live together. We were both living at our parents' houses while attending university but I recently graduated and now have my own place with a roommate. She still lives with her mom, but we have had a few discussions about moving in together.

I work full-time at an office job and she is in class with a part-time restaurant job on the side. She started this job at the beginning of November and was hired by one of her friends. She told me it was annoying that several of the male staff members constantly flirted with her and made inappropriate jokes despite her being in a relationship. This includes the restaurant's bartender (31/m).

In late November (only a couple weeks after she started), the staff had their annual Christmas party at the restaurant. It was on a Monday night since the restaurant is closed Tuesday mornings.

Later that week, my girlfriend was also supposed to be housesitting/dogsitting for a friend. She had to go feed the dog every day and was allowed to stay overnight if she wanted (starting Tuesday). We were talking about how we both thought it was hot to have sex in someone else's house, and planned to have a few wild nights when we got the chance.

**My side of the story**

I stayed home the night of the party. I was told it was staff only (no significant others) and I had work in the morning, so I  had no problem staying in. I dropped my girlfriend off and I was texting her throughout the night. At around 11 I told her I was going to sleep and said goodnight. I was still up another hour or so, but based on her texts she was quite drunk and it was frustrating having a regular conversation, so I didn't want to text any more.

I sent her a message the next morning and didn't hear back until around 2pm, when she informed me she was extremely hungover and slept half the day. Even though her mom's house was just around the corner from the restaurant, she said she instead decided to go to the dogsitting house (a day early) since it was on the way to the bar that some people headed to after the party. Apparently the homeowners left earlier Monday night.

We hung out later that night and she showed me photos of the party. I saw most people brought their significant others, and I was kind of insulted. I confronted her about it and she said she didn't think we were supposed to be invited and that I shouldn't have cared since I had work the next day anyways. We had a minor disagreement but nothing serious.

The next couples days were normal, we were happy, and Thursday night I suggested we go over the dogsitting house together. She started acting weird and said she didn't want to do that any more, but we could hang out at my place. We did, watched some tv, and I tried to initiate sex. She refused and said I was being too pushy and went home. I didn't think I did anything wrong and I was frustrated.

The next two weeks or so were more of the same. No sex, which led to frustration and silly arguments over little things. She started exams in mid/late December and stress was through the roof. Finally, after she finished exams we went out to a party, went home together and had sex. It had been probably 3 weeks, and previously we were having sex \~5 times a week.

Over the Christmas break we resumed having lots of sex, but things still didn't feel right. There were lots of arguments. We both returned to work/school and it seemed like every day there was some new disagreement. And now today... we were fighting about something stupid (whether or not her friend calling me ""Garfield"" should be insulting), and trying to resolve it. I made an offhand comment about how these little fights shouldn't bother me so much, it's not like she cheated on me.

And then she broke down. She started sobbing and saying that she made a huge mistake at the Christmas party. She said she couldn't bear to tell me and wanted to kill herself.

**Her side of the story**

After the crying stopped, I made her tell me what happened. I was pretty pissed off and yelling because she basically told me she cheated on me a MONTH AND A HALF ago and tried to hide it. This is her side. A lot of it is pieced together from her messages and what her coworkers told her, since she has no little memory of the night.

The party was open-bar, and she and her friend were hanging out at at bar most of the night. The bartender was another employee who had volunteered to take the night off from drinking to serve everyone else. Partway through the night, he started giving her drinks that she wasn't even asking for. She was having a good time and accepted them. Eventually she got blackout drunk, still pretty early in the night too. She doesn't remember me texting her goodnight, which was only around 11pm.

At midnight, she texted the dogsitting people asking if she could go over that night. There was no answer of course, since they were on an international flight somewhere. Everyone kept drinking until about 12:30 am. Around 1 am, the bartender drove a group of people from the party to a bar. He returned to the party to drive the last carload of people to the bar. Everyone else had made their way home by this point.

He dropped everyone at the bar except my girlfriend. He told the others he would drive her home, but together they then went back to the dogsitting house. I don't know the exact details of what happened next. But around 3 am, she sent a photo to their work group chat. It includes her, the bartender, and the dog in a bed. You could only see from their shoulders up but they were obviously shirtless. She included a message that said ""I hope everyone is having a good time! I know we are!""

She insists she has zero recollection of this happening. She woke up Tuesday lunchtime and was surprised she wasn't in her own bed. The bartender wasn't there when she got up and there was no sign of him. She said she assumed she must have decided to go out to the bar after, which is why she asked to stay at the dogsitting house instead of her own.

Apparently she didn't find out what happened until Thursday when she was talking to her friend. She was shown the picture she sent, which was since buried in the group chat. She still insists she has no memory of anything, and freaked out and didn't know what to do. That's why she refused to go to that house with me and why things suddenly got so weird between us. She says she wanted to deny to herself that it happened and didn't want to tell me.

After finding out the truth today, there has been lots of yelling and crying, and I'm currently home by myself.

**My thoughts**

First of all, I do believe she was taken advantage of. She was blackout drunk and the bartender was sober (and significantly older). Her coworkers all confirmed that the bartender told everyone he was dropping her at home, and also that he was feeding her free drinks all night. I also believe she didn't remember it happening at first, because there was a definite mood change on Thursday, which lines up with when she said she found out.

However, I can't help but feel like she was willing even if she was drunk. I'm hurt and it feels like I was cheated on. It's not like the bartender took her home against her will and assaulted her. She figured out the logistics of finding a place to go with him and looked extremely happy in the photo.

Why it still feels like cheating:

* I was told I wasn't invited to the party when everyone else brought their SOs.
* She had access to the dogsitting house a day earlier than I thought.
* She had brought the key to dogsitting house to her work party, even though it was right next to her mom's house.
* The bartender is a guy who had openly flirted with her for weeks.
* She didn't tell me what happened for over a month, and had planned on hiding it forever.

In anger I told her that if this wasn't cheating then she must have been sexually assaulted. And that if we don't press charges then at the very least we need to ensure the bartender loses his job. She cried again and refused to do either. Since she can't remember the night, she isn't willing to report him for anything and can't confirm she didn't want it.

What do you guys think? I'm an emotional mess right now and struggling to be logical. Do I need to put emotion behind me and support her as a victim? Or is she a cheater? Things were great before this and I had hoped to spend my life with this girl.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 1:**

I spoke to her again today and said that there were too many coincidences that make this seem like she planned it out. I told her I needed a bit of time to figure this out but I didn't think I would be able to move past it. I know drawing this out is probably not the best way to handle anything but all logic goes out the window when you're the one involved in a mess like this. However, there are still a few updates worth mentioning.

* We looked at the photo again, and it really looks like **the bartender took the photo!**
* There were only 2 coherent messages she sent after I said goodnight: 1 to the homeowners and 1 along with the photo in the groupchat. She had a few other messages to a non-work friend during this time that are complete nonsense.
* She showed me an earlier message where her friend said the party was staff only.
* She insisted she had never messaged the bartender except within the work group chat. She showed me unaccepted facebook and snapchat invites from him, and said she didn't even have his number. She was willing to let me use a recovery tool to prove they had never messaged but I didn't go through with it.
* She had the key on her keychain since she picked it up from the homeowners (like a week in advance). She is so adamant about this that she was checking photos she took of her odometer hitting 100k to see if her keys were visible, but no proof.
* She said she would be willing to report the bartender to work for sexual harassment, but was still uneasy about pressing charges.
* She still went through with it and hid it from me, so even if her story is completely true somehow, I'm not sure if I can move past it.

Thinking about abandoning pregnant GF...,"My GF is pregnant and I was really excited to be a dad when I first got the news. Problem is we went to prenatal screening and found out there is a high risk of Down syndrome. A follow up diagnostic test confirmed the baby has Down syndrome.

I want an abortion because I am not prepared to raise a child with Down syndrome. This is not me bashing Down syndrome people by the way, it's just not something I'm prepared to do. My GF doesn't want an abortion though so there's nothing I can do about that.

At this point I'm considering just ending the relationship. I'd pay whatever I'm required to by law, but otherwise move on with my life. My GF obviously decides whether to take the pregnancy to term, but I feel like I have a right to leave given how immensely different a child with Down syndrome is as far as responsibilities and future grand children.

Anyway, I'm asking for advice about how to break the news to my GF. I obviously have to tell her ASAP so that she can make an informed decision.  But I don't want to come across as manipulative.

I realise I'm coming across like a heartless prick here, but I genuinely care about my GF and want to do this in the best way possible for her emotionally",relationship_advice

I'm (25M) intimidated by a (32F) woman I met,"So Friday night a friend invited me to a party at a very nice house. When I got there I met a woman and we hit it off really well, she was laughing at all my shitty jokes which just fuels my confidence. We were also very close and touchy throughout the night, and when the party ended we exchanged numbers. On the Uber ride home my friend was explaining to me that I was basically getting close with the owner of the really nice house, he's telling me how's she's some high level investment banker and how she's worth millions of dollars. As soon as I heard this I felt deflated, career wise this girl is leagues ahead of me. She's well educated and independent. I work as a service tech for hvac with no college education making pennies compared to her. I texted her this morning and she immediately says how much fun she had Friday night and how she wants to hangout again. I'm scared to respond, because now I feel like I have to act like I even deserve to be in her presence. What should I do to make these feelings go away?

AITA for not being considerate of my roommate's girlfriend when she's over?,"My roommate's girlfriend stays the night 1-2 times per week.  Usually she comes in the evening, stays over, and then he leaves for work early in the A.M. while she kind of stays and leaves when she pleases.  Or she stays until he gets home and they spend some more time together.

So he usually leaves for work at around 5:00am, while I get up at around 6-6:30am and make my breakfast and start my day.  His girlfriend usually sleeps until like 10-11am, so I'm up doing stuff while she's still sleeping.  

Since she's been staying over, I've received numerous texts from him while he's at work about how I need to be quieter while making breakfast because she's still sleeping, how I need to remember to put the toilet seat down for her, and that I'm being too loud in the morning.  I'll wake up, 'be too loud', she'll text him to complain and he'll text me.  It's ridiculous.

I'm not banging pots and pans trying to ruin her sleep.  I'm simply going about my day.  If I'm listening to music or watching Netflix on my phone, I use headphones.  It's a small apartment with paper-thin walls so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do..  Wait 5 hours until she wakes up before I do anything? 

**My thoughts on this issue are as follows:**  She doesn't live here and has never once actually talked TO ME about these things.  She'll simply text her boyfriend and he'll send long texts about how he's 'told me many times'.  Honestly, I don't care how she feels.  She can put the toilet seat down herself. (I've received a few long messages about how I 'once again forgot to put the toilet seat down').  I live here and pay rent and if she doesn't like it she can go home (She drives to and from.  She's free to leave whenever).  But he seems to think that he's justified in his complaints about me not tip-toeing around her while she's over.  IMO he needs to just tell her straight up that she has no right to complain about these things.

AITA?

**EDIT** Okay guys, I'll put the damn toilet seat down.  And the lid.  But it's because I want to.

**EDIT #2** Alright it looks like we're kind of torn between putting it down and leaving it up, for a variety of reasons ranging from *""She's a strong independent woman""* to *""poop particles EVERYWHERE!""*.  This is getting interesting.

**EDIT #3** Thanks for the responses.  I read them all and learned a lot about bathroom cleanliness above all else, and going forward I will put the toilet seat down habitually, both so that the poop particles don't get everywhere and because it just looks more aesthetically pleasing to walk into a bathroom with a closed lid.  Yes, ***a closed lid***.  Ladies (and gentlemen, but especially ladies), observe the status of the toilet seat before you squat to avoid either falling in, or sitting on a closed toilet seat lid.  Anyway, this was a journey and a half.  Furthermore, I'll speak up and tell it like it is next time I get complained to about my conduct in my own place.  Consider this a successful Reddit thread.  And if I had a dollar for every upvote this thread got, I'd still be in shitloads of debt.

[Another Update] Should I be concerned about my daughter's (18 F) relationship with her married teacher (40s M)?,"Original Post:

Previous Update:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8poj55/update_should_i_be_concerned_about_my_daughters/?st=JI7P1S9T&sh=ed83f0a1

As of yesterday I felt like I was handling this situation the best way I possibly could. As of today I feel like a failure of a mother.

I got up really early this morning around 3 AM to give my daughter's father a call. He's over in Europe at the moment so I figured that time would be best for him, but I mostly just wanted to get ahold of him before my daughter woke up so that she wouldn't overhear any of the conversation and think that I was going behind her back. I decided to do a quick check before I called him and peaked into her bedroom to make sure she was still asleep. Maybe I'm naïve for being shocked and completely caught off guard by this, but not only did I discover that my daughter wasn't asleep, she was gone. I have never known her to be the type to sneak out (though I guess it's called ""sneaking out"" for a reason) and even when she's gone out late with friends in the past she's always let me know beforehand.

Of course I freaked out and tried desperately to get ahold of her. I sent her dozens of messages and tried calling her but it kept going straight to voicemail. After about 10 minutes I gave up on reaching her and was trying to figure out who to call that might know where she was when I heard the front door being unlocked. I went and stood out in the hallway and when she walked in and saw me she had a look of pure panic on her face. I never have been very strict with my daughter in the past, but in that moment I very sternly told her ""I need an explanation. Now.""

She instantly burst into tears. I asked her where she had been and I asked if she was with Mr. Smith but all she kept telling me was ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" I finally just told her ""I have been nothing but loving and understanding with you. I know you're an adult now, but you still live under my roof. The least you owe me is the god damn truth."" I asked her once again where she had been and she said, still crying, ""out for a drive."" I asked if she was alone and she shook her head no. I asked if she was with her teacher and she hesitantly shook her head yes.

It took me a moment to sit and process that all of the things I was afraid of happening had likely been going on behind my back this whole time, and that my daughter had clearly lied straight to my face when I spoke with her yesterday. Eventually I said to her ""So I take it you weren't being honest with me when you told me you saw him as just a friend.""

To that remark she went from softly crying to sobbing. All she had to say was that she was sorry but she ""loves"" him.

I can't remember the last time I felt this angered or betrayed or disgusted. And not because of my daughter. Because of her teacher. This man has clearly been grooming and manipulating my daughter and I was stupid enough to not do something about it sooner and gave my daughter and her teacher the benefit of the doubt even with all of the obvious warning signs. Now it's probably too late for me to do anything.

We talked for a while and I tried my best to as calmly as possible explain my concerns about their relationship to her. I tried to tell her that it wasn't healthy and that being in a relationship with someone who once had a position of power over her is a recipe for disaster. I told her that it's easy for a man of his age and with his experience to take advantage of a younger girl. I also explained that a man who sneaks around with her when he has a wife and a family of his own is a man who does not truly respect her or care about her well being. To everything I said though she just responded with something along the lines of ""he's not like that, it's different with us.""

I was able to get her to talk a lot more about what's really been going on between them, but I don't feel it necessary or appropriate to share all of those details here. If you feel I've left out any significant details you are more than welcome to ask me to clarify something, but otherwise I'd prefer not to disclose more than what I have to as it is obviously an uncomfortable and sensitive topic. I do feel I should mention that she claimed the ""romantic"" aspect of their relationship only just recently began and that they were not romantically involved while she was his student. Of course, I've recently discovered that my daughter is more than capable of lying to me and covering these things up, so I am aware that this may be untrue and I will try to do some further digging into that matter.

At this point, as much as it kills me to admit it, I don't think there's anything I can do to stop this. I have spoken with my ex husband but he is at a bit of a loss too as to what to do about all this. He wants to confront Mr. Smith, but we are still trying to work out if that's the best idea and if it will really do any good in this situation. I will be reading up on the laws in my state and the policies of the school district, but besides potentially getting Mr. Smith fired I'm not sure that there's anything else that can be done legally speaking. I want to keep him as far away from my daughter as possible but I feel completely powerless in that, which crushes me. Trying to forbid her from seeing him seems like it would be pointless considering she is a legal adult. She is still dependent on her father and I and we could technically hold that against her to get her to stop seeing him, but that would no doubt permanently damage our relationship with her. Informing Mr. Smith's wife is also a possibility we've considered and would likely cause him to lose contact with my daughter, but that would of course cause my daughter to resent her father and I as well. Right now, I'm honestly so worried about her safety and her mental health that we may just end up having to do something that will result in her resenting us in order to protect her (and protect other female students in Mr. Smith's care). Trust me when I say, her father and I are considering every possible option.

Thank you to those of you taking the time to read all of this and thank you for continually offering your support and advice. Any suggestions you have of a solution (or legal advice) that I may not have thought of are absolutely welcome and greatly appreciated. However, any ""I told you so's"" or any criticism of my parenting is unwelcome and unnecessary. Believe me, you can't possibly be any harder on me than I am already being on myself at the moment.

TL;DR:  It turns out my daughter is in fact having an affair with her former teacher. Because the romantic part of their relationship supposedly began after she graduated, her father and I are afraid that there's nothing that can be done to put an end to their relationship. We are considering all possibilities, even those that may cause our daughter to resent us. Any helpful advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated at this time.

!!! Edit:  

Thank you for all of your responses. I am having a hard time keeping up with the comments, but my ex and I are very thankful for the helpful advice you all have given. After taking a lot of things you all have said into consideration, we've come up with a general plan on how to handle this. First and foremost, I will report this to the district office when it opens on Monday. Soon after we are trying to work out a small ""getaway"" trip I can do with my daughter, preferably to an area with poor cell service like up at a cabin to remove her from the situation unfolding. I don't want to hide all of this from her and plan to tell her how her father and I are handling things while we're on the trip, but I'd prefer that she not be able to have contact with Mr. Smith during this time. It may make for a miserable and awkward few days together, but I think keeping things open and honest with my child is important. My ex husband will be returning from Europe this upcoming week, so he will try to deal with speaking to the wife and Mr. Smith (separately or together, whichever works out) while my daughter and I are on vacation. Our hope is that all of this coming out in the open will scare Mr. Smith off, and that by the time my daughter and I return home he won't want to pursue things any further with her. This may seem like a cruel thing for us to do for her daughter, but at this point we feel it's what we have to do to protect her. We are still open to tweaking this plan however, so if you feel there is a better way we can handle this please feel free to share your opinions.

***Extra Note: I have received quite a few messages and comments suggesting that I get my daughter a therapist. I just wanted to clarify that she has actually been seeing a therapist for a couple years now ever since her father and I split up. I believe I mentioned this in a previous post. Thanks anyways for the suggestion though!",relationship_advice
I found my husbands secret Reddit account where he has PMed girls from gone wild... I feel like this is cheating? Me F29/ him M31 - located in North America,"This is my first time posting here and I'm on mobile. I'm sorry if I make any mistakes. 

My husband and I have been together for 6 years, married for 1, friends for 14 (we met in high school.). We were out at an event on Friday night and my phone died while he was busy for two hours so I started browsing Reddit using his phone. My thumb print is programmed into his phone and it isn't unusual for us to use each others phones. 

When I opened his app the entire front page was filled with nsfw content/subs so I looked at the profiles and saw that he was logged into a secondary account used only for porn. I have no problem with porn - in fact we frequently watch it together. I saw his user name and scrolled through a page of comments when he came over to check on me. I quickly closed the app and when I saw him - I'm not sure why.. I think I felt so shocked I didn't want to tell him I'd seen? 

He took his phone from me and while he had it he logged out of that account and gave me back his phone. 

Later that night from my own Reddit account I searched his user name and found hundreds of messages on gonewild subs but also subs for specific girls. His comments were mostly compliments to body types that don't really match with mine. A few girls had posted fantasies about making videos with men while they do xyz or exchanging Snapchat videos. He posted ""I've PMed you"". One of those posts was just before our wedding. 

Four years ago he posted on an askreddit thread titled ""Reddit have you ever met a psychopath?""  He commented ""I may be dating one now. Wait a couple months and I'll let you know"" we had been together two years at that point. But I don't know context - if we'd had a fight or what?

He had an important work event tonight that he was really stressed about so I haven't brought it up yet. I feel sick to my stomach and I haven't slept at all. We've been trying to have a baby and I just can't imagine continuing to sleep with him when I'm feeling so undesirable. 

Am I overreacting? Is this cheating? How do I talk to him about this? I've never felt worse about myself or my body. 

TL;DR - without intending to snoop I stumbled upon my husbands porn Reddit account and he's been messaging people in a way that feels like cheating to me. ",relationship_advice

TIFU by losing track of where my dog is.,"Throwaway account so imma get very pissed if this gets a lot of points.

So I live with my family and my dog spends her nights in my room which means walking her in the mornings is usually my responsibility. This morning (obligatory this actually happened today) i went downstairs and open the door to let the dog out first before putting on shoes and grabbing my keys, in case she was bursting to go (i got up quite late since i graduated high school and pretty much just lounge about helping out at home) she can do it outside rather than in the house. By the time i'd gotten ready though the dog was nowhere to be seen.

Now i wasn't too concerned since she can't get past the locked gate, so i knew she wasn't lost. After searching the garden i figured she must have done what she needed to do, and snuck back in to get another nap in (she's a lazy pupper). I went back inside and, since the rest of the house was still asleep (or so i thought), i didn't want to yell for her, so i resorted to check each room.

So the sleeping arrangements in my family is kind of unusual. I have a small sister who doesn't like to spend the night alone, so she chooses a parent to spend the night with in the double bed, while the remaining parent is ""banished"" to her room with the twin size bed, i get my own room. After checking the dog is not in mine or the small bedroom, i figured she'd gone to snuggle with my sister and dad in the big bedroom, so i went in to drag her out because _dammit_ i was determined to get my morning walk.

In i went, and it took me about 30 seconds to realise my mistake: the silhouette in the single bed had been way too small to be my mum. They must have gotten up, carried my sleeping sister to her own room, my mum snuck in with my dad, because there they were, on the double bed, _going at it_

Turns out 30 seconds wasn't fast enough to piece the story together because just as i realised and panicked and tried to leave, my mum looks up and we make solid eye contact while i'm pretty sure my dad's dick was still inside her (not that i was keen to verify or think about it). I was catatonic as this point and my brain shut down and i just turned on my heels and left, with a deadpan expression this whole time.

My sister is no longer allowed to sleep in the big bedroom. And yes, turns out the dog was indeed in the room at the time.

TL;DR: let my dog slip into my parent's bedroom, went in to get her, broke my 18 years streak of managing to avoid catching my parents in the act of producing more siblings for me.

Edit: let the records show that the first thing i did after getting tf out of that room was to check on my sister (who was awake by this time) and tell her to leave our parents alone for a while.",tifu
TIFUpdate by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital,"Hey everyone. This happened a few weeks ago but I haven't had time and just wanted to make sure everything had settled down before updating.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvg72z/tifu_by_thinking_my_daughter_was_being_raped_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

In the original post I left out some details that caused a lot of confusion so I will clear those up now. When I went into the room I grabbed his shoulders and started screaming at him. He stood up and I pushed him down. I went over to my daughter to make sure she was okay and she was screaming that it was a fetish. Her bf was unconscious and we sat there trying to wake him up. He woke up and was conscious but was shocked/confused. He was wearing his jeans with his wiener out while they were having sex and was also shirtless, so I wrapped a blanket around him to cover his genitals and upper body and helped him into the car. In the car he zipped himself up and I gave him my sweater to wear. I realize now how my original post might sound like I was driving him around unconscious but I would have called the ambulance and not tried driving him myself as this would've been life or death so I'm sorry this was misleading. Hell, I probably wouldn't have been able to carry him to the car (I'm just a strong but average sized lady :P) Anyways, since he was conscious at the hospital they just had a nurse check up on him but he had to wait to see a doctor so he was in the ER for a while. 

The doctor did some scans and found that her bf (thankfully) didn't have any injuries. He said that most likely her bf fainted since he didn't hit anything on the way down and woke up shortly after. Her bf has also fainted before (long story) so thankfully he was unconscious due to the fainting and not the actual knockout. 

After the doctor determined he didn't have any injuries I called his parents to tell them, and they decided they didn't need to make the long trip. My daughter's bf begged me not to tell them the specifics of what had happened so we kept it at that.

For my daughter, we had a conversation about her kink. She says she has a safe word and has never had to use it and her bf always takes care of her after sex to make sure she is okay and loved. I told her that I didn't want her to be afraid to have sex at home because it's a safe place and I don't want her to feel bad over this. I installed a lock on her door as a little ""I'm sorry"" gift. I think this is something I should have done a while ago to give her some privacy, and I'm glad I've got that covered now. I also vowed to never have any surprise visits again. 

For her bf I got him a card, some chocolate, and I paid for him to have a night at an Airbnb with her so they could have a private night together. 

TLDR; everything worked out in the end. Boyfriend wasn't hurt, and daughter has a lock on her door now.",tifu

My (29F) husband (31M) has been abusing our son (5M) for being left handed.,"Throwaway since people know my main account

My son has been learning how to write and I have been spending more time trying to teach him. He is left handed and up until this point, I never once considered it to be an issue. A few weeks ago, my husband proposed that he should be the one to teach our child how to write and even suggested that it would be a bonding experience for both of them. In fact, he made it clear that during this time, I should go out and enjoy myself since I don't go out that often. I thought everything was fine until I started to notice that over time, my son didn't want to practice writing anymore and would even start to throw full blown tantrums if I even suggested that we should start practicing again, which is unlike him. 

This morning, I managed to get him to open up to me and he told me that his dad would yell at him for being left handed, calling it bad and dirty, and would even pin his left arm behind his back really hard so he would be forced to use his right hand. I am devastated that this was happening right under my nose and I don't know what to do. I don't know how this was able to be hidden from me for so long and I've never even heard of being shamed for being left handed. He has clearly been negatively affected and I have yet to confront my SO about this but I don't know how to proceed.

Edit- for those wondering, my husband isn't with us at the moment and won't return from his trip until Tuesday. Sorry if I'm taking too long to respond, I've been trying to take my son's mind off of what's happened to him by playing games

Edit2- son is currently taking a small nap. I'm going to be packing our things into suitcases because I cannot stand to be in the this house. Don't know where we'll go so I'll have to sort it out later but we're not staying here

Edit3- Just got off the phone with BIL. Didn't tell him much except that there's a situation happening and asked if we could stay at his place. He said we're welcome to stay over  so that's where we'll be going in an hour

Edit4- made it to BILs house. Son is playing with cousin. In laws have not yet asked what happened. I feel terrible right now, like I'm actually going to vomit the more I think about what happened behind closed doors. That's not hyperbole. Thanks for the advice.

"My ex-husband kidnapped our son, and now I found mugshots showing him in jail with felony charges. He has primary custody, how do I get my child?","My ex-husband went off grid with our child over 6 months ago.  He shut off their phones, moved them, and of course blocked me on all forms of social media.  I live in California and they stay in Kansas, and our case is out of Arkasas.

I still cannot get an address or even find them...but when I can find a lawyer I'm sure he will be forced to surface.

NSW Australia. Last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. I jumped out because I'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. I now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.,"Long time LA reader here, and I'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. When I'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.

Early in November we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend I'll call Aaron (because his name's Aaron and I think he's being an idiot) had bought on eBay. We had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.

It'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. I'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. There was no way I'd go through the water as it looked, but because I'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river I didn't want to risk it. I didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. I said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

Aaron decided to push on and started moving and I panicked and got straight out. It was FAR more water than I'd had to go through when I near lost my car and life before. I got out well before the water though so I didn't let water in the car btw.

Aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. He was EXTREMELY lucky not to drown, and I ran down & helped him out. Immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. Admittedly I'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of eBay parts in the back so it's not like I'd have made much difference.

We phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. We haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. But on Friday I received a letter from a lawyer I know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. It's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because I made the car unsafe by getting out. It was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

I think he's being a dickhead. Someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? Ideally I'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what I think they'll be. I want to contact his lawyer to tell them Aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should I get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

I [26M] Killed My Girlfriend's [25F] Parents Dog In Self Defense And We're On The Verge Of Breaking Up,"This was locked by the overzealous mods on the other subreddit and I'm told this place is more reasonable.

My girlfriend's parents, who I'll call Jane and John, have a notoriously vicious doberman, who I'll call Satan, they refuse to train. It killed a cat in their neighborhood a few years back and has aggressively gone after visitors and neighbors when it gets off the leash. I've refused to go over to their house since meeting her for this reason, and as a result any visits we've had her parents came to us.

My girlfriend had a falling out with her closest friend recently and it's been a rough few weeks on her. Her parents asked her (and me, they always extend an invite despite me never going) over for dinner and family time to cheer her up. I agreed to go as I figured it might make her happy to actually have me attend, but I told her I would only go if Satan was kept in the basement (finished basement with a door) while I was there. She agreed, and we both spoke to her parents on the phone and they agreed.

We showed up and I had her go in to ensure Satan was in the basement, which it was. Everything was going great, John gave me a little tour and showed me their backyard and some bags of sand he needed moved, and the four of us started to cook dinner together. Jane realized she was missing vegetables and asked if my girlfriend would run to the store with her, so they left. John asked me if I'd help him move the sand since neither of us are great cooks, and led me to the backyard, leaving the sliding door open.

About 5 minutes in I hear John yelling to ""watch out"" from inside the house. Satan comes barreling out the patio door, down the steps and immediately lunges for me. I start trying to back up calmly while telling Satan to fuck off, and he keeps making lunges for me. John (mid 60's with mobility issues) comes out of the house and helpfully decides to start screaming at the dog which only makes things worse. I kick at Satan when he lunges for me, and he grabs my leg. I'm on the ground while John comes over and tries to pull Satan by the collar and I try to push my finger into its eye and hit it in the snout and end up getting bitten badly and held by my left arm. At this point I yell at John to move back and use my pocket knife (again, rural area, not abnormal to carry) to free myself.

John is apologizing profusely, and said Satan was whining in the basement so he went down to comfort him and he slipped out. He offers an ambulance which I decline, so we put polysporin on my arm and leg and we get ready to leave in his car to the hospital. My girlfriend and Jane get home and start panicking and I tell them what happened as I get into John's car. Both of them immediately rush to the backyard, my girlfriend not even asking if I'm ok, to tend to the dog.

John waited with me until I was evaluated and released and Jane came in the meantime to tell us Satan died at the shelter and to apologize. I asked why my girlfriend wasn't there and Jane said I'd have to talk to her myself. When I got home, I asked her where she was. She told me with Satan, and asked me ""how I could kill a dog."" No question about how I am, no comfort for what I had to do, nothing. I tell her I'm sorry, that I tried to back away, tried kicking it but it bit me. She keeps asking ""why"" I had to kill it, why I couldn't have tried other things, then accused me of killing it right away ""because I was always afraid of it."" This eventually made me blow up, tell her that her parents cared more about my well-being than she does and that I wasn't going to let myself get mauled to protect a fucking dog. She left and we haven't spoken since sunday, she's at her parents house and John called to check on me and told me they're talking to her.

So here we are. Neither of us willing to budge. She believes I should have done more to get Satan off me non-lethally and seems to think I killed it because I wanted to. I believe I did my best, had very little time or opportunity to react to a dog that had severely aggressive tendencies for years and while I didn't want to kill it I'd rather it die than leave me disfigured. I've grown up in a small town around free roaming dogs my whole life, I know when they just want to scare you and when they plan to rip you to shreds and this dog had murderous intent. I don't know how to communicate with her or make her see my side, and I feel betrayed and hurt she isn't even attempting to view this from my point of view. I understand she's going through a lot, but I feel like she's taking it out on me. How do we fix this?

TL;DR Girlfriend's parents vicious dog attacked me, I killed it to protect myself. Girlfriend seems completely indifferent to my experience and blames me for my actions, left home and refuses to speak to me. I feel hurt and betrayed. What do we do?",relationship_advice

WIBTA for telling a neighbour that I've seen her in porn?,"She moved into my building yesterday (1st November). I've seen her in a couple of videos. Her face is clearly visible, enough so for me to be certain that it's her. Normally I'd just leave it at that, but here's the thing: they're filmed through a window. Like 2 buildings next to each other, and the bed is right next to a large, curtainless window in one building, and the camera is in the next building over pointed at the bedroom in the first building.

I assumed it was meant to be like that and everyone was aware/involved but after meeting her she really doesn't strike me as the type of person to do porn. Not saying there is a ""type"" but from having met her she's very religious, wears clothing that's baggy or full coverage, seems a bit shy in general, and she's an accountant. For all I know that's a concious choice she's made, like a persona she's created, so people don't link her to the videos, or it could be her actual personality, and she has no clue the videos exist.

The guy in it looks at the camera enough for it to be noticable, she never looks at the camera once. I'm thinking maybe she doesn't know she's made it.

Do I tell her and WIBTA?

Edit: I'm a woman.

&#x200B;

Update: I ran into her on the lift. I asked if she could stop by mine quickly (we're sort of friendly as I helped her move some stuff in to her flat). She agreed. I said ""look, I found something and I'm only showing you because it doesn't look like you know it's going on"" she stopped me and said ""is it porn?"" I said yes. She then told me that the reason she broke up with her ex and moved here is that she found one of the videos online, realised it was her and her boyfriend in the footage, confronted him, and he admitted that he and his buddy in the next building had been filming her. She dumped him on the spot and is currently trying to get the videos taken down. She thanked me saying that while she was aware, if she wasn't she'd want to know and she was grateful to me for helping out a stranger. She's coming over next week to drink wine and watch strictly.",AmItheAsshole

Americans are really going out of their way to help strangers, go well above what you could expect in Europe .

AITA for refusing to attend my dead nephew's birthday celebration?,"Background info: My sister has a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. In January 2018, she told my family that she was pregnant with a third. She was over the moon, and she found out a few weeks later that the baby was going to be a boy. She publicly announced when she was 12 weeks pregnant, and miscarried in March at 14 weeks pregnant.

She was devastated by the loss. We arranged a full funeral, and she buried the remains in a cemetery. The headstone has the baby's name and ""birth date"", and she visits every week to put flowers on the grave. She joined a support group for parents who have lost a child.

In the last year and a half, all family events and celebrations have incorporated a celebration of her son's ""life"". We all visited the cemetery on his due date last September to commemorate him. At Thanksgiving and Christmas, she set aside a little plate of food for him at the table and we visited the grave after dinner. She posts pictures on Facebook all the time of her two living children next to the grave, and captions it ""my three babies"".

His due date is coming up again this month, and she's already organizing a celebration at the cemetery for his ""first birthday"". I've dutifully gone along to all the other events, but this time I told her I wasn't willing to go. I tried to be gentle, but I ended up telling her that I think she's clinging to her grief and it isn't healthy.

She's incredibly angry at me. She's accusing me of invalidating her grief, and that I never cared about her son anyway. She said that he's her child and part of the family, and that she's incredibly hurt that I don't want to celebrate his life. She hasn't spoken to me since I told her I wasn't going.

I don't know what to do. I care about her grief, and I get that having a miscarriage is a truly devastating event. But I also don't want to spend the rest of my life having to pay homage to a dead ""child"" that was the size of an orange. I mean... at 14 weeks you don't even need a surgical abortion, they'll just let you take a pill and miscarry at home. I don't want to have to go to a cemetery multiple times a year and listen to eulogies for a 14-week-old fetus for the rest of my life.

I also think this focus on the dead ""sibling"" has to be unhealthy for her two living children. I'm not going to tell her how to parent, but I also feel that I'm doing them a disservice by continuing to enable this kind of behavior. I don't want every family celebration to be focused on their dead ""brother"". She can do whatever she wants on the due date, but I don't want to play a part in it.

AITA? I don't want to hurt my sister, but I'm getting really concerned about how she's grieving a year and a half later.

EDIT: Some people have written that I'm an asshole for what I've written here, particularly around how early the miscarriage was. I will not edit the post, but I hear you and will be more careful. Please be assured, though, that I have never said anything dismissive about it to my sister (unless you count the conversation I asked about as dismissive)

EDIT2: Thank you all for your input. I'm not able to respond to every comment but I am trying to go through and read them all.

I'm enormously relieved that most people don't think I'm an asshole. I certainly don't want to be. But it's not a situation I have a lot of prior experience with, and I've found it really difficult to navigate. So thank you for the input.",AmItheAsshole
AITA For saying no when a child I didn't know asked if she could play with my sons bike.,"This is literally the hot topic of the day for my entire family and I'm fed up of being called an asshole so I'm going to ask on here. 

We are on a family vacation at the moment and we had gone to a park where there were a lot of young families like my own. My 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. They were pretty close by. 

My son is obsessed with his bike and loves it. He had been playing on it for a while, and the other family had a little girl his age that kept looking over. 

When we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. My mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blasé attitude towards belongings and she's lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn't attached to material things.

I interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl 'why don't you ask (my son) since it's his bike?' She did and my son said no. She looked a little crestfallen but went back to her family and she didn't seem bothered afterwards. 

My entire family looked at my like I was an evil witch and even my own husbands facial expression was surprised at me. 

I got a little defensive and told them that it was our sons toy to lend out as he pleased, and I was a little irritated to hear my mom say to my son 'honey, sometimes it's nice to share' because he looked upset afterwards. l know that, he knows that, but it's his new toy and he shouldn't be made to feel bad over not wanting to share with a total stranger.

TIFU by dating my cousin for 5 months,"You hear this story millions of times of people unknowingly hooking up with their relatives and finding out about this atrocity in the most awkward ways, and mine was no exception.. even had to create a new account cause it is so embarrassing 

I was talking to this guy on Hinge who had the softest of hazel eyes, and at the time, I thought he was the one. After exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. We dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...

Since we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn't had time to meet each other's parents. Instead of doing the traditional, I'll bring you over to meet my parents, and I'll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. You can pretty much tell where this story goes now. 

Long story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend's mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(Uncle's daughter). It took her a second to realize as well. Since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn't seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and I moved to the same city. We could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. Even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn't right to do. That was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family. I told my friends that it didn't work out and silently removed everything from social media..

"Girlfriend won't go to sleep until she is satisfied with our ""cuddle time""","So before your read, I need to say I have nothing against cuddling to sleep. I actually love it.

The problem I have here is that my girlfriend won't go to sleep, or will cry, unless we have a ""cuddle time"" before turning off the light.

And honestly I wouldn't even mind if it lasted like 5min, and that we would just drift to sleep while cuddling.

But no, she doesn't want it like that. She absolutely needs the light to be on, otherwise she will be upset.

If I just start to get sleepy (wich I am because I want to sleep), she will get upset.

She absolutely wants to look me in the eyes, so cuddling to sleep is out of the question because I have to keep my eyes open too.

She also needs sweet talk, wich I like but not when it's forced like that. She literally asks me to say cute thing to her, and not just ""I love you more than anything"", she wants to ear what I think about her, how much my life is wonderful with her, etc... And honestly I have no problem with that, but only when it's spontaneous, not when it's forced. And we say cute thing to each other all day long so it's not like I never say it.

But the worst thing for me is that she will not want to turn off the light and cuddle to sleep until she is satisfied of our cuddles and my talks. And that can take some time. Sometimes 15min, sometimes 1 hour.

I know it is normal to just chill and sweet talk with SO, but it's always a necessity for here to do it right when I tell her I'm tired and I want to sleep.

If I say I'm just too tired, or that it's been some times already and that please could we turn off the light, she will just say ""No ! Don't say that !"" and will make her ""sad puppy face"", so I have no say in it.

Seriously, I think she's just being too clingy and childish. Is it unreasonable to just say ""good night I love you"", and then cuddle to sleep with the light off ? I don't even know anymore if she asks too much or if I don't do enough.

I feel like I have no control over when I can finally drift off to sleep, she has to decide when or else she'll cry for SEVERAL HOURS.

Honestly I wish I could just happily do all that, so that both of us would go to sleep without a problem, but I can't. It's so forced for me, it's too much to comply when I'm tired.

Could I have some insight ? What do you think ? Am I being unreasonable ?

AITA for making my SIL cry at her baby shower by suggesting we should stop exchanging gifts in the future?,"I come from a fairly well off family, and my husband and I do well  (although we both work high demand jobs for it). We've always been very generous to his side of the family. Gifts are very much both my husband and my ""love language"" and in my culture (Chinese), elaborate gifts to inlaws are very socially acceptable as a way to show they are held in high esteem. It also helps with some of our guilt for being super busy and not always around. Additionally, my side of the family exchanges generous gifts. One concern of mine originally was to treat my husband's family the same as my family, i.e. by not spending way more on my family than his.

Last Christmas, we had some weirdness over Christmas day present opening. I had purchased a lovely cashmere throw for SIL (husband's brother's wife). She googled the brand and price then and there (which kind of annoyed me) and later I overheard her make some joke about how she could pay ""half a mortgage payment.""  Several hours later during brunch, someone asked her what was wrong (she seemed upset) and she confessed that our presents always make her feel bad, she's tired of us ""throwing our money"" in her and her husband's face, and Christmas has become really stressful with pressure over gift giving. Husband and I apologized profusely, and did some self reflection afterwards on the unintentional effects of elaborate gift giving and decided to go more low key in the future. Although a little part of it has always sat poorly with me since. 

This past Saturday, I attended a baby shower for the same SIL. It's the first gift giving occasion since Christmas and I really wanted to do it carefully. I asked a coworker who recently had a baby what range is typically appropriate (she said she mostly got gifts between $30-$50) and so I decided on three little things from the registry totaling just over $30. Anyways, at the shower it becomes clear that while certainly most gifts were in the $30-50 range, all attendees who were family members seemed to give more like $100 gifts. Near the end of the event, MIL pulled me aside and said that SIL felt like I was being spiteful to her for  Christmas. I again apologized and as a cover, said that husband and I had written a check for the little one's college fund as well but didn't feel it was appropriate to hand to her during the present opening. Then I scurried off to the bathroom and wrote a check for $100. When I found SIL by herself for a second I handed her the check and explained that we wanted to give her this earlier but present opening seemed like a bad time. She looked at the check and kind of bitchily said, ""We don't need your money.""

I kind of snapped and told her bluntly (and not like yelling, but not like in hushed tones either - people nearby apparently definitely overheard) that her that I was tired of her shit and if it made her feel better, we could just stop exchanging presents in the future. She started crying and I immediately left. I've been getting my texts from everyone in the family and her best friend about how I ruined the baby shower ever since.

(ETA for additional  context - My husband and his family are American and we live in the US. We are in our early/mid 30s, my BIL is 28 and SIL is 24 or 25.)

(ETA2 - I realized her comment might have made the xmas gift sound way more than it was. The throw was 320 pounds, which isn't quite half a mortgage payment, but not cheap either. I purchased it for her during an business trip to Scotland last year. It is not fancy looking or flashy at all (light grey)  and not a obvious "" designer"" brand, just an old Scottish maker. It was intended to be good quality and last many years. If she hadn't looked it up I don't think it would have been an obviously expensive gift.)",AmItheAsshole

My [30 M] Wife [30 F] lied to me about where she was yesterday.,"Update: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/al02i9/update_my_30m_wife_30f_lied_to_me_about_where_she

I hate that I'm having to write this but here it goes.

My wife of 6 years and partner of 14 has been studying a lot lately for a certification she wants to get related to her job. She mostly studys at home but will often go to a library or Starbucks if she really needs to focus. We aren't the kind of people that are incredibly co-dependent and we each have our own set of friends and time for ourselves that the other understands.

This does require quite a lot of trust as I've found that people that get exceedingly jealous of their partners are usually the ones that are the most dependent/controlling of them. Well yesterday that trust was shaken a bit for me.

My wife told me that after work she was going to study and then head to the gym. She has a scheduled class at her gym and didn't want to run all the way home and all the way back in the snow and ice so she was just going to study at the library and then head over.

It occurred to me after a few hours though that yesterday was MLK day and all the library's were closed. No big deal, I figured she'd just go to a Panera or something and then head to her class. When she gets home, she's in her full gym outfit but she's still in full makeup and runs right upstairs to take a shower. I asked her how her day went and she said ""It was good. The library was good, I got a lot done and the gym was difficult today which I liked."" I didn't say anything to her about the library being closed and thought the whole thing was odd. While she was in the shower I decided to get on Facebook because the gym that she goes to has a page and they put updates with pictures on there for marketing and what not.

There were only 4 people in the class other than the instructor and my wife wasn't in any of them.

I haven't said anything to her about it yet and I can't help but suspect the worst. It is very unlike her to hop in the shower right after getting home like that, she usually eats dinner and then hops in really late at night. Anyway, I don't really know what to do or how to bring it up to her without sounding paranoid.

Edit 1: I called the library and they confirmed they were closed yesterday. The gym is also really a kickboxing fitness thing and it's only one big room with a bunch of heavy bags - the pics were from when my wife said she was there and she's definitely not in any of them.

Edit 2: So I came home for lunch after reading all the messages. Pretty much half of you are saying talk to her and the other half saying ""collect more evidence"". So I'm torn. 

I did, while I'm here at the house, peak into her gym bag and found this http://i.imgur.com/dnQ74Ds.jpg . There are some gym gloves, hand wraps, sunglasses, headphones... And sexy red underwear. I don't know what the logical explanation for it would be other than the obvious... This sucks. 

Morning update: Wow... So thanks to everyone who reached out about this. It was impossible to read all the comments and reply to every message but I really appreciate it.

I decided not to confront my wife about this last night and instead confide in my best friend who I've know practically my whole life. He was on the ""wait it out, collect evidence"" bandwagon. I haven't begun to do that yet but I will in the next few days.

Last night she did tell me that she was going to do the study/gym thing again today and would be back around the same time as Monday. Again, this is somewhat typical for her. I have a second job that I work Tuesday / Thursday and so M/W are usually her gym days. What is a little strange is the studying away from home again. She does is sometimes but it's rare and I can't remember when she left to study back to back away from home. She gets off work around 3:00 each day and the gym class ends around 7:30, so she's got 4.5 hours to do whatever if she wanted. 

Addressing some of the most popular comments from the comment section.

1. ""How do you know that she wasn't just at a boudoir thing"". I guess anything is possible, we don't live in the largest town and there is only one place I could find online that even advertises that they do stuff like that. I doubt they would give out any information but it just doesn't seem realistic that this is the answer. That's a lot of trouble and lying to go through just to take some pictures. The other part is that I am going out of town this weekend, leaving Friday night and returning Sunday and she will be all alone to do whatever she wants. If she was doing a boudoir thing she wouldve waited until my trip that has been planned for a while and not do it on a holiday.

2. The gym photo. I do know the photo is from Monday 100%, there are hashtags and other things on the Facebook post that solidify that. I also checked their Instagram later and there were more pictures from Monday as well. However it could be from a different time of day as you guys have suggested and not when she said she was there.


I will say for some added context that she has seemed different the past few months, especially sexually. I don't want to get too graphic or anything but she's kind of become fixated on doing new things and being more provocative. I honestly feel like an affair is the only answer. That's all for now, I might update in a few weeks if anything changes. Thanks guys. 

Oh and shoutout to u/VH3m for saying she couldn't be cheating because ""she is fat and no one would want to sleep with that hippo."" you sound nice.

Scared to tell my (24M) girlfriend (27F) that I was raped.,"I have a good relationship with my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years. We live together and love each other very much. We have overcome difficult circumstances before, and I think we can overcome this, but I'm terrified to tell her.

I recently went on a trip out of state. I stayed in a hostel close to some bars. In my room was 2 young men and one older woman, in her 40s. I introduced my self to all of them I went out to the bars that night with the guys I had met, who were great company. The lady from our dorm went her own way. 

Later that night, I got very drunk. I texted my new friends after we got separated to let them know I was on my way back to the hostel. On my way back, I see the older woman from our hostel sitting on the curb. I'm slurring my words at this point, but asked her if she was ok and wanted to walk back to the hostel with me, about 8 blocks away. This is where my memory after leaving the bar became very hazy. I remember her being overjoyed to see me. I remember her complimenting me but though nothing of it.

The next morning I woke up feeling like absolute trash. Sick, cold and nauseas. Still a little drunk. Barely remembering the details of the previous night. My roommates are passed out and the lady is checked out.  We all slept til 3 p.m.; occasionally I got out of bed to throw up.

I talked to my roommates when we woke up and they were giggling and complimenting me. I didn't understand why, and asked them what they meant. That's when they told me that they saw me with the lady on top of me when they came back to the room last night. I instantly felt way sicker and a rush of anxiety overcame my body. I didn't remember that night, but I remember that I had no intention to have sex with anyone, especially an older woman. I didn't consent to whatever we had done, i didn't want her to mount me, I didn't go out looking for sex, I know I wasn't turned on or erect, I feel that I was raped. 

I was scared of so much at this point; STDs, pregnancy, ect. I really cannot recall what happened, but I know my intent when I came back was clear: I did not want to have sex. I debated getting the police or my hostel involved and still sort of want to, but I know from my first conversation that we were all from out of state. I feel that there's no point in getting the law involved now. 

What I'm terrified about is telling my girlfriend. I got an STD test 5 days after and I'm clear, but I'm scared she won't believe me because I am a man who was assaulted by a woman. I think she will think I cheated on her and intentionally looked for this, and it breaks my heart and terrified me. I don't know what to do, or how to bring this up, but I feel like I need to tell her. How would you bring this conversation about. 

TLDR:

Went on vacation. Possibly had sex with a woman I didn't want to while I was blacked out drunk. Scared to tell girlfriend because I think she'll call me a liar.",relationship_advice

[UPDATE] I [29M] found my girlfriend [32F] has a soft strap-on dildo that she's been hiding from me. I think she knows I found it. What do I do?,"Last post: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu9h99/i_29m_found_my_girlfriend_32f_has_a_soft_strapon/

A lot went down in the last few hours. Less dick jokes this time round, because now I'm over the ""surprise floppy dong!"" aspect of it, it's turned out a lot more serious than I expected.

(for what it's worth, my girlfriend told me to still call her ""she"" at all times except when dressing male, so I'm still going with that for this update post)

I fell asleep not long after the post I made last night. Got up around 2. Headed downstairs to get my 2pm ""breakfast"", and GF was down there in her pyjamas, with a cup of tea and her phone. Good a time as any to address the elephant in the room, I thought.

It was awkward as hell. I started off with ""hey"", got a dead silence, and followed it up with something like ""sorry, I was looking for my uniform shirt yesterday, but that drawer's really none of my business, you can keep whatever you want in there, it's all good"".

Tried to keep it as non-specific as I could. If she didn't know I'd found it before, she definitely knew now.

She just sort of nodded in response to me. Then she apologised for not being in a talkative mood last night, and started telling me about her day. But it came off really strained. I could tell it was on her mind, and she kinda trailed off after a bit.

Eventually she told me to come upstairs with her. I thought she just wanted to talk somewhere more private (it's a shared kitchen, we're living in a family's spare room). But no, she went into our room and showed me everything.

She crossdresses. That's specifically how she referred to it, not trans or drag king or anything. She wears the dick (the packer, as the comments informed me last night), and the crop top she'd had it wrapped in flattens down her boobs. And it turns out she's been going through my drawers for a lot longer than I've been going through hers, because she got a shirt and some comfy tracksuit pants from my drawers and put them on. She has long hair, so she ties it up and hides it under a flat cap that she had in another drawer.

After she'd shown me all of this, basically in silence, she looked at herself in her mirror for a bit. Different angles and stuff. To me she still basically looked like herself, with a flatter chest and different clothes, but she seemed fascinated with how she looked now.

She kept glancing over at me to see my approval, and I smiled back. Tried to look as reassuring as possible. I noticed she'd been pretty shaky putting things on. When she was looking at herself in the mirror, I went over and put a hand on her shoulder supportively, which basically seemed like it was what pushed her over into starting to cry.

Then she broke the silence and just couldn't stop talking. She's been crossdressing secretly for the past couple of months, she was so worried about what I'd think. She insists she's not transgender, she just likes to crossdress sometimes, it makes her feel good and confident. Also insists it's not a sex thing. Just for fun.

I kept saying ""it's okay, it's okay, don't worry"", mostly because I didn't really know what to say. I ended up hugging her as she sobbed on the bed. She calmed down eventually, and told me ""thank you"", because she said she had no idea how I'd react.

She asked me how she looked (while still all red-eyed from crying). I just said ""you look great"" and smiled, and she hugged me again. ""You don't mind me wearing your clothes?"" ""Yeah, no worries!"" I guess she was always a lot more careful with my stuff than I was with hers in my rush yesterday. We didn't really talk much about it, I just asked a few simple questions like if she wanted me to refer to her with different pronouns when she was dressed like this (I know that's usually a trans thing but I thought I'd check anyway).

We didn't do much else after that. She eventually got on her phone again, I got on my laptop. The two of us hanging out together doing our own thing, just as we usually do, only with her in different clothes. I basically got my mind off it for a bit, and then I had to go to work again not long later. Wrote most of this on the bus to work.

I've been thinking back to when I said she looked great. She basically just looked like herself still. A few different clothing choices didn't transform her into a different person for me, and they definitely didn't transform her into a man. It was basically just the same as she always is, for me. But I realise it was a lot more significant for her, and I respect that. But also I don't want to pretend it's a mindblowing shift in appearance for me, too.

Also I was thinking... I think I'm glad she's not trans. Is that bad of me to say? I love and respect her but I realised when thinking about it last night, if I ever did see her as a man, things would be really different for me. I know I was going on about pegging in the last post, but ""girl with strapon"" and ""someone who straight-up looks like a man"" are really two different things for me, and I don't think I really have the wiring to have feelings for her as a man. But I'd do my best to be supportive anyway, because I don't want to stop her being the person she is. I'm really hoping the situation stays where it is and never comes between us. If it did... I'd have to let go of her as a girlfriend. Let her find somebody right for her.

TL;DR: I don't have a problem with her crossdressing, but mainly because she still just looks like a woman to me and I barely even register it as crossdressing. Should I tell her this? I think she'd take it badly after the emotional moments earlier.

I have to go into work now, so I won't be responding for a bit. Thank you for everyone who's offered support, in public or private.",relationship_advice

[Update] MI Boss won't pay after I keft my job,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/arxpqm/mi_old_boss_is_withholding_last_paychecks_until_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So I would like to thank everyone that gave me advice on how to help. It helped ease my mind greatly. Now, on to the details!

Following what everyone suggested, I went to LARA (Licensing and Regulatory Affairs) and reported my old place of employment for not paying me around a month worth of checks after I left. I tried one last time to get my money from my old boss. When I asked him why he wouldn't give it to me he said and quote ""You fucked me over, now I'm going to fuck you over.""

That royally pissed me off. I felt hopeless when I read that. Knowing someone intentionally was hurting my personal funds because I left his company. A shame. But that's when I found out I was still apart of their email system.

Now I know this sounds bad, but they kept payroll on the email and I was looking to see if they were even planning in paying even though LARA was just about to begin investigating.

This is when I heard from the IRS saying I was misclassified as a sub contractor when I was really supposed to be a W-2 employee. I found my records in the email and sure enough, I signed a W-2 when I started.

Essentially the investigation ended up concluding and my old boss has to pay LARA back along with some hefty fines. His shop is actually set to close in a matter of weeks. Karma is a bitch.

Thank you all again!",legaladvice

TIFU by spilling a massive amount of blood in a public park,"So, my lady friend gets a call from her cousin saying he has a college film project due, but can't seem to get his fake blood to look just right. She is a theatre/ photography type, so she agrees to help him whip up some better stage blood. 

So we do, but its still not quite right. It looks perfect to the naked eye, but still not perfect on camera. 

So its getting pretty late. We decide to take the bottle home and work on adding a little more pigment to help it out. We were parked on the other side of a large park. At this pont it's almost 11pm and we haven't seen anyone the entire walk. 

As we are walking, I'm talking with my hands when I hit her arm and knock the bottle out of her hand on a concrete wheelchair ramp. 

The bottle splits open and every drop of ""blood"" pours out. All 32oz. It looked like a Tarantino flick. Its running down the ramp. Real horror show. 

But we're not too worried. First of all its threatening to rain, so we figure it will wash away. Also there aren't alot of people in the park. So we figure if nothing else we will get to the car, fill a bottle with water and go wash it down, if it doesn't rain before. 

We walk about 10 more minutes to the car, fill a bottle with water from the fountain and start driving back. Until we see the police SUV flying down the road toward us. Hauling ass, lights blazing

He hits us with the spotlight, but then turns it off and pulls into the nearest parking lot closest to the spill. I'm like ""we should tell him"" but she is a bit freaked out. So I say ""ok I'll pull into a good spot, leave you in the car and run and tell em what happened."" As soon as I pull over another cop in a cruiser pulls up and tells us we need to clear the area. I'm like ""well...I wanted to..."". And he drives off midsentence toward the other cop. 

Then another cruiser comes. This cop motions for us to leave. So we do as she said. I wasn't looking forward to talking to them anyway.

Not sure whatever came of it, but I'm sure they figured it out. 

TL,DR - Walking in a park. Carrying stage blood from a film project. Drop it. It goes everywhere. Looks like a slaughter has taken place. Police are summoned. We make our getaway. ",tifu
What foods can a teenager cook for his parents to help their depression?,,AskReddit
After I (36F) told my Dad and Stepmom (both late 50s) about my engagement and their response triggered me to suddenly remember years of repressed childhood memories and now I do not know how to move forward with our relationship.,"Long post, but there's kind of a lot to this...

Repressed childhood memories coming back? I have heard of this happening but I honestly never thought I'd experience it and holy shit this has been jarring.

My Dad and stepmom have been together since I was age 3, so 33 years.

My childhood was a disaster zone. I have lost large chunks of time where it is a big blank area. I thought it was maybe because I had to take so much Benedryl as a kid because my allergies were so bad that I didn't remember much. Now I think the memory loss is mostly trauma-related. Dark murky memories would come up but I have had no real timeline of my childhood. My mom was married many (many) times and we moved a lot and she had a baby and then another baby and then two more babies. I can sometimes piece together a home we lived in, or what school I went to when, but it is all a blur. I was both my parents first child and the baby of teenage marriage. There was alcoholism and drug use and chaos. Somethings have always stood out... Like the time a stepdad put a gun to my mom's head. Or, my sister being born. Or, times when we had to move out fast and we were told to start throwing the things we wanted into garbage bags and put them into the car.

My mom and I were very close and I was kind of her copilot through all the crap. Crazy as our life was, I loved the hell out of her and she died 2 years ago from cancer. All in all, I have had a kind of hero through it - my dad.

&#x200B;

About a year ago, my dad, stepmom and I were sitting outside around a backyard fire having drinks and real talk. He said something that surprised me, which was that I had lived with them as a kid for a period of about 4-5 years. This was news to me. I had not remembered living with them for that long at all. In my head, it was maybe 6 months. My dad was hurt I did not remember living with them. During that time, my stepmom apologized for being so mean to me during my childhood. I shrugged it off and joked, ""Well, I guess its water under the bridge since I don't remember."" She said, ""no, I was really mean."" And, I said, ""It's okay. All of it has come around. We are good now.""

&#x200B;

Fast forward to two days ago. Over the weekend, the man I love got down on knees and asked me to marry him. Magical moment and we have been very happy. In fact, it's the first relationship I have ever felt safe in, but it takes work and effort for me to trust. I tell my Dad and stepmom the news and watch the whole thing turn and capsize. My dad makes a comment about how I had to beat my sister to a ring (my sister is their daughter/ my half-sister and is in a serious relationship that is also leading to marriage soon). I am struck. I do not feel competitive with my sister and she and I have always celebrated each other's victories. Then, my stepmom asks about where and when and I tell her it might be a year out and she starts making excuses about how she will not be able to go, not willing to go, but tells my dad he can go. I hear this and know my dad will not ever take a trip without her and start to panic that he will not come to my wedding. The comments pile and mount, one on top of the other, until my whole body is trembling. Although I have been sober for over a year suddenly I want nothing more than to drink. But, I do not drink and say everything is ""fine"" when asked and try to leave on a good note to make sense of my feelings in private.

&#x200B;

Something that needs to be explained is that there has always been a strain with stepmom and me. I try hard to do things right, but I am scared of her and always have been. As an adult woman, she still scares me. She is incredibly controlling, powerful, dominating and it is hard. My tactic in avoiding being a target of her passive-aggressive behavior and anger is just to be super nice. Nice all the time. Smile. Swallow. Repeat.

&#x200B;

When I came home from the engagement announcement, it was like the flood gates opened.

One memory cascades into another and another and another.

Suddenly I can recall being 7 and 10 and 12 and all the fear I had as a child in their home.

I remember how much she hated me. The name-calling. The scapegoating.

I remember sucking back tears and being told not to cry at all. I remember hearing all the time ""You're fine.""

I remember the secrets I had to keep about how mean she was. I remember walking down the hallway in our home and being pushed into another room while my dad watched TV in the living room and her whisper-screaming that I was a brat and a terrible child and was ruining her marriage and being told to say nothing to my dad.

I remembered she controlled my sleep habits. I have always slept on my stomach but she required that I slept on my side to face my little sister at night and would come into the room in the middle of the night and catch me on my stomach and wake me up to yell at me and tell me to go back on my side.

She controlled the relationship I had with my dad. We could not do anything she was not a part of, did not supervise, or control.

I remember being cornered again and again. I was targeted and she was after me and it was relentless.

I remember her sisters telling me how sorry they were and that is was not okay for me to be treated this way.

She was a relentless bully.

I remember my sister who is 7 years younger, always trying to protect me and shield me from her mom.

I remember being taunted and teased and made fun of.

I remember one time she yelled at me out front of our house and I got so scared I peed my pants and had to run inside and change.

I remember our neighbors saying that I was safe in their home and if I ever made a mistake in their house they would not tell my stepmom.

I remember when I left my dad and stepmom's house to move back with my mom that they took down all my photos from the walls and told me they would be fostering or adopting a kid to fill my place.

When I moved back with my mom life changed and was chaotic in the way it was with my mom so I think I just forgot all of this stuff and kept going.

But with this sudden flash of remembering everything now, there is just anger. Layers and layers of anger. Anger that my dad did not stand up for me. Anger about what they knew, but I did not. A huge sense of abandonment. What the hell is this? How can I have forgotten all of this? How does it just sweep from view?

&#x200B;

In my head, I rage at her and the main thing I say is, **""Guess what? Now I remember.""**

&#x200B;

I sent them a text. A sheepish way to confront it, but for once I stood up for myself. It was very hard and my whole body quaked and trembled. They did not respond.

&#x200B;

The thing is... they have been trying in the past few years. They moved to my state. They want a relationship with me. She did apologize back in the yard that day. I know my dad loves me and tried in his own way to protect me. I don't think I will get any sense of accountability from them. But, now it's like this mystery has unlocked inside me. I always felt unsafe around her. I never felt like even when she has been nice to me as an adult like I could trust her. Now I know why.

&#x200B;

I think I am about to lose this last remaining chunk of parents I had. My mom is gone and I have continued to work through all the things that happened with her and will head back to therapy to deal with the rest...

&#x200B;

My sister asked what I want to come of all of this. Why put it all towards them? What kind of battle am I setting out to wage? And, I really don't know. I didn't see this coming and I am at a loss. I feel guilty for bringing this up. Like, I am going to wreck the family. But I am also furious. I want them to have to hear it all from me. I want to ask my dad what he did and did not know. I want her confession. I feel like I can already hear my dad telling me not to be so dramatic, and yet, I feel like I will not be able to stuff this one back in.

&#x200B;

How can I rehash something that I only now remember? Is it worth it to even try or do I just salvage a fake relationship for the sake of having one?

I feel bad about feeling sorry for myself. Is there anything that will come from holding them accountable or am I just headed down a path of anger and victimhood?  I wonder if we can even have a relationship from here...

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: I recently told my dad and stepmom I was getting engaged. My dad brought up my sister's likely engagement immediately and completely derailed my news. My stepmom said she wouldn't be coming to my wedding. It brought up years of bullying from my stepmom and neglect from my dad that I had forgotten all about. Now I do not know if I can or want to have a relationship with them and feel insanely guilty for even bringing it up.**

Edit/Update: Wow. This went... 

I figured this would be my own private story/rant for a few eyes in a corner of Reddit. I did not expect this response. I've been battling with wanting to take it down now. My fiance has encouraged me not to. I've been panicking that my parents will see this. I do not want to hurt them. There is no part of me that wants that. Even in anger. I just want them to know and be honest, without downplaying what it actually was. Not sure that will happen. Pretty unlikely, but its a want. As for what to do about it. I will head off to EMDR and have a handful of referrals for Monday. I will take the ""Damaged Old Person's"" advice (thank you) and move slowly here and get help and not go scorched earth just yet. 

Thanks for the help, encouragement, and congrats. 

As for my partner, which a few posts have asked about... I think he has been a huge reason this is coming out. I think the security of our home and relationship, plus lack of booze as a coping strategy, has meant that now there is the opportunity to actually feel things? I dunno. New territory. He has been hugely supportive in all areas of my life. He is sober, too. A processor. A thoughtful person and we have sat and read some of the responses together and appreciated the insights and conversation. 

As for those questioning validity of my memories, or repressed childhood stuff? New territory also. Like I said at the top, I had heard of this but didn't know it was an actual thing till I was in it. I can only speak to my experience right now as it is occurring and it's been like a download of fresh information complete with recalling my home, surroundings, time of day, where I stood, where others stood, facial expressions, tone, who was there, what was said... So, no my brain didn't just fabricate a false set of memories. I feel the truth of all of these things in my core. This stuff was in me and there is not a question of its reality. The blanks have just been filled in. It feels like a very unfortunate Aha moment. 

Thanks for all of those who have shared their own personal stories of hardship and pain... Man, some of us have walked some really tough roads. I'm sorry for you all, too. Someone shared a link to an article about how isolating abuse is. It's true. Makes me feel crazy. There is a strange solace in knowing others are out there powering through their own pain, too.

"My (18F) best friend (18F) cheated on her boyfriend (21M), got pregnant and is lying that he's the dad. Should I tell him?","Ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. Also I know this is pretty fucked up but Natalie is a nice girl, she's my best friend. 

We graduated high school this summer so our friends and I all went on a small vacation to Italy. We found a Groupon thing online so it wasn't too expensive. Natalie is dating Eric but he didn't come on the trip with us. It was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. It's pretty well known among us friends that Dylan who is in our high school, likes Natalie. He's like really into her. Well when we all went to Europe, since Eric wasn't there, Natalie was all over Dylan. Acting like a couple, being all flirty. They'd SLEEP in the same bed but she'd insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. Well, I shared a room with Natalie and I walked in on them having sex. Afterwards I asked her what she was doing since she was dating Eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. It was not. We were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. Dylan's dreams came true that week. But only I knew about it since it was our room. Everyone else had their suspicions but I was the only one who really knew the truth. 

When we got back home, she promised me that she was just ""crazy"" since she was on vacation and she'd never cheat on Eric again. She kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. So I promised to keep her little fling a secret. Fucked up I know but I have more loyalty to Natalie than Eric. 

She continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she's now pregnant and I asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if I slapped her across the face. She said it's obviously Eric and I reminded her about Dylan and she insisted that Eric is the father and to never mention Dylan in front of her again. She's terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told Eric and he told her not to worry and he'll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they'll be ok. She told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he's gonna be a good dad. He wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she's busy planning a quick wedding too. 

Y'all. Dylan is obviously the father. Like 100%. They were fucking like rabbits in Italy and I don't think she knew how to say ""where can I buy condoms"" in Italian. I feel bad for Eric since he's like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

I love Natalie she's my best friend but this is so fucked up like I feel really bad for Eric. I know she's scared and Eric would obviously be the better dad but c'mon that's not his baby. Dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. Eric is older and he's graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. But it's not fair for him. I know she's trying to save her own ass but it's her fault for cheating on him.

I don't know like if I tell Eric, Natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby's life.",relationship_advice
AITA for taking back my UNICEF donation?,"This past Halloween my family was going to go trick-or-treating so I offered to stay behind and give out candy. My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.

So family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, ""hmm these kids are a little old but whatever"". That's when they say, ""trick or treat... For UNICEF!""

They then tell me they're looking for donations ""for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat"". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, ""oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow..."" in the most sarcastic tone ever.

I look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, ""or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here"" and I shut the door in their face.

I'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?",AmItheAsshole
UPDATE: My (21m) best friend (20f) found out that I have self harm scars and has told our entire friendship group (19-21). They are now excluding me from almost everything.,"[you can find my original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csy8ds/my_21m_best_friend_20f_found_out_that_i_have_self/)

I know since the internet doesn't like to be left hanging, so I thought I'd give you guys the update on my situation. It's sadly not the happy ending that I was hoping for.

After I read all the advice on my original post, and responded to PMs and answered questions, I decided I'd message each friend individually to ask if the general consensus of the group was really what Allie said it was (with everyone being uncomfortable, and preferring that I didn't come to the beach).

Through doing this, I sadly found out that Allie was telling the truth. Every single person in my friend group except for 2 said that my scars would make them uncomfortable at the beach (keeping in mind, I never said I'd go to the beach), and they'd rather I didn't come.

I told them all how much it hurt that they'd say this to me, and how upset I was that I was basically being abandoned by my friends, and that I didn't want to associate with them anymore because of how hurt I felt, and those messages were met with either no reply, or simply ""I'm sorry, I don't know what you want me to do about that.""

As for the 2 friends who weren't uncomfortable, they both confided in me that they have also struggled with self-harm in the past and were disgusted by the behaviour of the others in the group. One of people has chosen to stay with the group, and the other has told me that she'd like to remain friends, but still hang out with those people on occasion

So in conclusion, I lost 9 friends, I feel like shit, and I don't know if my self esteem will ever make a recovery from this.

Have a wonderful day, wherever you are.

**EDIT: For those commenting ""you didn't lose 9 friends, you lost 9 people who didn't care about you"". I understand that they weren't my friends, my wording was poor.**",relationship_advice
Cops of Reddit what is the most suspicious thing you've ever caught somebody doing for a totally legitimate reason?,,AskReddit
TIFU by giving my son permission to beat his bully's ass.,"My son was born with a condition called Pectus Excavatum. In layman's terms, his chest is sunken in. His condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. In December, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

About three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. The kid has been through a lot. 

Well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. Unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. And because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. Well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, ""Dad, I'm cleared now. A kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. Can I kick his ass?"" Well, my son isn't really a fighter. He's fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he's always gotten his ass kicked. So I just figured he was just talking. But this is the first I had heard about the bullying and I was concerned. I could tell he was distressed about the situation so I told him to knock the fucker out. He just nodded and went to his room. 

Now, his older brother is s tough SOB. He had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he's in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. I talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don't get in trouble. He told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. I asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. While I kinda agree with his thinking, I instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

The next morning I took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. On the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. ""Have you taken xxxxx to school yet? Well, after you do, go pick up your son. He got in a fight."" I just assumed it was my oldest son. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! He was beaming! He pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. ""I warned him."" I was so proud. 

He had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. My older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. He said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. He got suspended for three days. 

TL;DR I gave my son permission to beat up his bully because I didn't think he would and he did it.

EDIT ONE: The kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. It wasn't malicious. Just two boys clowning around. He was horrified that he had hurt my son. The bully punched my son in the head every day. Once he found out my son couldn't do anything about it, he just kept on. My son wasn't the only one he bullied, either. Also, the bully's brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son COULD fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

EDIT TWO: My son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a LOT of new friends. He used to hate going to school but now he's disappointed that school is out for summer. Crazy!

EDIT THREE: Thanks for the precious metals! And holy shit! Front page?!?!",tifu
TIFU by making everyone in the elevator think that they were going to die.,"Alright, so this is an old story, but when I found this sub, I had to share.

When I used to be a Muslim, I had an app on my phone that would sound the adhaan, when it was time for prayer.

I was on holiday the day of the fuckup. I got into a hotel elevator, this was shortly after the Paris attacks. There were roughly six people in it. Then the adhaan for prayer started blasting from my phone. For those who don't know, the adhaan starts with allahu Akbar. When that blasted from my phone, the elevator went into mass hysteria, people were crying, screaming, another man tackled me and held me down. I had to explain to them that I wasn't a terrorist. Then everyone just started laughing.

I understand that everyone may think this isn't a fuckup, but I feel like I shouldn't have had my adhaan blasting like that after an incident like the Paris attacks.

Tl;Dr: adhaan blares in elevator, everyone thinks I'm about to blow up the elevator.

EDIT: Holy fucking shit, this post has blown up.
Thanks to the people who awarded me silvers and gold:)

I need to clear some stuff up first:

When I meant laugh, (ik, that segment was worded horribly) I'm not referring to full out laughter. Just some chuckling and light laughing(if that's even a thing)

Please stop with all these questions about my religion, let me make this clear, if you message me about my religion, I will not respond. So stop.

And one gripe, a large amount of negative comments,  in most of them the person commenting doesn't seem to understand the full magnitude of the incident and why it provoked that response, please take the effort to fucking understand what I wrote first :)

And to all the haters who are send messages to me calling this story fake, I really don't care if you think my story is real or not. I'm not here to argue  about whether this actually happened.",tifu

"My gf (24f) and I (25m) have been together for 6 years, recently she suggested that we open up our relationship because she wants the excitement of guys flirting with her again.","When she initially brought the subject up two weeks ago I told her that I wasn't comfortable with the idea which she responded with ""I still love you and want to be with you but if you don't want this then we should break up."" 

We talked about it some more and when I asked her that if it was just going to be flirting or if she was planning on sleeping with anyone she said that if it happens it happens. After hours of trying to figure things out I reluctantly agreed because I didn't want to lose her as I planned on proposing on our anniversary in February. I found out later the same night, after she told me, that she has had two dating apps on her phone for a couple weeks already and that she's already been ""talking"" to guys. I told her again that I wasn't comfortable with the whole thing and I especially wasn't ok with her sleeping with other guys.

Last night I asked if she wanted to fool around as our intimate life has been basically non-existent for the past month (not for a lack of trying on my part it's just that's she's never in the mood or tired) and was met with a very enthusiastic ""sure!"" followed by "" after that I'm going to go see a friend."" I was immediately turned off because I knew she meant another guy and I started getting ready to go to sleep as I worked early in the morning. She proceeded to get ready and left at 11pm. It's now 5am and I'm leaving for work and she just got home and went straight to the washroom.

I'm not sure what to do anymore.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who gave helpful advice, I'm still reading through everything and more keep coming. I feel like I should clarify some things.

Yes, I agreed to open our relationship against better judgement because I didn't want to lose her. That meant I was able to see other people too but I choose not to because I only wanted to be with her and I made that clear to her.

Despite the facts that she's had dating apps for awhile and spent time (a few hours here and there, last night was the longest) at a guy's house, she insists that nothing happened and that they're just friends who flirt with eachother... that's it.

"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...","If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.

"Parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl","I've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. My parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

These girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

I'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but I feel they still need to be taught that. 

And same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

Edit; If a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. Self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. He definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

Same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. If that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

This post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. That way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. Men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",unpopularopinion

[UPDATE] [CA] How can I get my neighbors to get rid of their noisy chickens?,"I posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3brffg/ca_how_can_i_get_my_neighbors_to_get_rid_of_their/) about three years ago, and it got very little attention, but some people did help and for that I was (and am) super grateful. Plus, I figured we all like update posts, and this situation of chicken warfare is finally resolved. 

&#x200B;

To recap: my neighbors had five chickens that would squawk at ungodly hours of the morning and night. They were actually my parents neighbors; I was crashing with them over the summer and have since moved out. We did contact the city, who came and determined that they were up to code. But the neighbors assumed it was us (my parents had been pretty vocal in the neighborhood about not liking the chickens), and they decided to retaliate. 

&#x200B;

First, they claimed that a structure on my parents' property was illegal, and my parents had to deal with a city investigation, which turned up nothing, because it was not illegal. Next, they claimed that our little patch of sidewalk front yard, which is right next to theirs, was actually infringing on their property and demanded a property survey. We actually discovered that their front garden was partially on OUR land, so that was nice. My mother e-mailed the neighbors letting them know they were going to put up a little line of stones just to keep the garden property line clear so that they could plant their side, and the neighbors went batshit. Started sending long, rambling e-mails to my parents, started calling and hanging up, started throwing trash on our side of the garden and they eventually left several dead rodents still in traps on our front porch. After that, my parents got a security camera. 

&#x200B;

Things quieted down for a while, and we soon found out it was because the neighbors were trying to sell the house. Their house is pretty nice, and we live in a high COL city in a neighborhood that has really gotten popular in the past \~10 years. Basically, if all went well the neighbors would be making 2 or 3 million dollars from the sale. They hosted several open houses, and this is where my dad decided to get petty. See, my parents deck directly faced the neighbor's backyard, which still had the chicken coop and was one of the main attractions of the open house (they were actually trying to sell it as an ""urban farmhouse.""). As people would wander into the backyard of the open house, my dad would stand on his deck holding a very large sign that said, ""NO CHICKENS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD."" The other side said, ""THEY BRING RATS AND VERMIN INTO OUR LOVELY COMMUNITY."" I was half horrified, half cracking up. I told him that it would only escalate things, but he was insistent that any new neighbors not be allowed to keep the chickens. He would periodically shout down into the neighbors yard (our houses were very close), ""we will NOT allow new neighbors to keep chickens!""

&#x200B;

My parents got many furious calls and e-mails from the realtor and the neighbors. Apparently my dad was making people hesitant to buy the home (I don't blame them, he was acting like a crazy person), offers were dwindling, and they were going to have to lower the price. My dad said he would stop his chicken protest if the coop was removed; the chickens stayed, so my dad stayed on his deck for every single open house. 

&#x200B;

To make a long story of chicken subterfuge short, the neighbors sold the house. On their last night in the house, they egged my parents entire backyard and deck. I asked my dad if he wanted to report it, and he said it would be better to be rid of them. A lovely family has since moved in, and the first thing they did was dismantle the coop. 

&#x200B;

TIFU by letting this subreddit devolve into a collection of creative erotica writing assignments [META],"I don't know if Meta threads are allowed, but I think this needs to be said. I believe the removal of the ""NSFW only on weekends"" rule hurt this subreddit a lot. The majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting TIFUs that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. Nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, TIFUs that are actually not TIFUs at all and serve only as humble brags - TIFU by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool I am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. Sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have >50% posts on this sub.

When you open many of those stories, you have people actually calling OP out for the story obviously being fake/barely a TIFU (like the guy who almost went down on his cousin and then in an update actually went down on his cousin, like who is actually dumb enough to believe that happened?), so I really doubt I am the only person who thinks the subreddit is regressing.

TL;DR: Personally I think the quality of the subreddit would be improved by reinstating the NSFW weekend rule. These post clearly have their audience so I have no problems with them existing at all, and when they were scarce they were indeed actually interesting. However I don't think it's fun to open this sub and seeing the exact same shit every single day.",tifu
AITA for telling my sister she needs to lower her standards,"So my sister is 22 and has never been in a relationship. I'll be honest she's unattractive overweight and has no personality whatsoever. Despite all that she has a huge ego. She whines about being unable to find a relationship even tought there were men interested but she rejected them because her standards are too high she expects someone that will take care of their looks (she doesn't) someone who will focus on her and her only. Yesterday I snapped in the middle of her rant about how all men are the same and said to her that she isn't a great catch and should either take care of herself more and better herself or lower her standards because everyone around her is tired of her bitching, she stayed quiet and we didn't talk since.


Edit : Some of my familiy members did try to explain the same thing to her a few times in a nicer manner but she always rolled her eyes and continued with the same ""men aren't shit""

Also I didn't just assume she wants attractive buff men she stated it quite a few times saying that men have no reason to be fat unattractive and lazy


I'm a female just for the INFO


Edit 2 : I never said or tought that fat people are unattractive because they're fat or that they're unworthy etc. Fat people are people and they have the right to love themselves BUT I was just calling out the hypocrisy of my fat sister calling out and shaming men for being exactly that and thinking that fat man don't have the same value as fat women do my problem isn't my sister's weight but her mindset 

🚨 PLEASE STOP MAKING FAT JOKES AND HURTFULL COMMENTS TOWARDS FAT PEOPLE IT DOESN'T HELP THE SITUATION IT JUST MAKES IT WORSE 🚨

TIFU by telling my three year old daughter that I would eat her booty,"Alright so let's start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you'll be like wtf? 

So my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  And more accurately it's more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. Anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife ""Mommy, get my booty! Get my booty mom"" and off to the races they go. 

Obviously this is a game that both parents play and she'll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. This get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it's cute and we haven't gotten any feedback on it.

This brings us to last night. The wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells ""GET MY BOOTY DADDY!"" To which I reply nonchalantly ""I'm going to eat your booty! Nom nom nom"" since her butt was right next to my face. 

I immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling ""EAT MY BOOTY DADDY! EAT MY BOOTY"" and takes off running. Dear lord, what have I done?! I try to go into damage control and revert back to Get your booty, but it's too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

I took her to daycare this morning, I hope she forgot all about it. I'm dreading picking her up.

TL;DR my daughter yells Get my booty to initiate games of tag. With her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face I instead say I'm going to eat your booty! She now yells EAT MY BOOTY to initiate the game instead. 

Edit: A word. Also thanks for the gold kind stranger!

There were lots of requests for an update after pickup. All is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. 

Thanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them. 

For those that got offended, sorry? None of it was intended and i thought it was a funny anecdote to share. Cheers!",tifu

TIFU by possibly making a kid a paraplegic.,"I'm fucking pissed.

I'm giving some passengers, a young couple in town, a ride to St. Anne's. We're having a great conversation and coming down Harry Hines. We're on the left lane, and this city worker was coming out of a ditch on the right slowly, with his hazards on. This other dude is coming in at like 50 mph and slams into the truck. He cusses about ""where the fuck did that guy come out of,"" backs out and takes off. The guy passenger in my car takes pictures and gets the dude's license plate, and I tell the girl to call 9-11.

I park and the dude and I get out and go over to the guy. I didn't wanna look inside because the front of the truck was all smashed in, and I never get used to seeing someone dead. Someone said he was out cold. His airbags deployed. Then the post starts leaning more, and the power lines start stretching. The post cracks and snaps something and a huge voltage flame shoots out.

No one wants to move the guy because with a collision like that, you can seriously fuck them up more. Then someone yells that the truck is leaking gas like a mother fucker and they keep a perimeter.

One of the scariest fucking things I've ever had to do in my life, but the thought of the flames reaching the gas and burning the dude alive... I couldn't stand around. I ran to the passenger side and unbuckled the guy's seatbelt and shouted at him to wake up. Blood, drool, and snot are coming out of his mouth. He's fucked up. I can smell the gas, and the cables are stretching even more. So now it's not just burning to death. There's a possibility for electrocution.

So, fuck it. I run over to the driver's side and grab the guy. He couldn't have been more than 120lb and was about 5'8"". I never realized how heavy deadweight actually is. All I'm thinking is, ""Not today. Not today. Not today. Don't let me burn. Don't let me get electrocuted. Not today."" This dude was HEAVY and I'm struggling. The other dudes come running to help and we haul his ass to the median.

And the fucked up thing is that while all this is happening, I'm still thinking about that cunt that hit him just dipping the fuck out of there. This kid... he couldn't have been older than 25... could have fucking died and the other dude just fucking left.

A woman in blue scrubs, couldn't tell if she was a nurse, doctor, or tech, and an EMT with a first aid kit were nearby (it's the medical district, after all) and we all tried keeping the kid awake. The EMT asks his name, and the kid's just mumbling. I start talking to him in Spanish. Blue Scrubs is telling him to stay awake, and we check his his torso. He's got a fractured clavicle... a nasty bruise on it.

The ambulance and firetruck arrive, horns blaring. Although only a few minutes passed, that shit felt like an hour. I'm proud of Madi (the female passenger who called 9-11). She gave perfect directions. I'm holding the kid's hand just trying to let him know... we're all letting him know that he's okay. He's finally conscious and speaks english. He's local. And he just starts crying.

""You're gonna be alright, dude. They're here to help you. You're okay."" His grip's weak.

Then he says it. ""I can't feel anything. I can't feel anything. My back.""

That shit sinks me. I look at his legs, and he's moving them. ""You're okay, man. You're moving your legs. It's the shock. You're moving them."" And I'm telling him this because I'm a selfish, scared piece of shit and I don't wanna take the blame for possibly making him a paraplegic. But he WAS moving his legs. He was flexing his feet. I want him to know that he's gonna walk. He can still walk.

I'm pissed at myself almost as much as I'm pissed at that abysmal coward who couldn't face the destruction he caused and lambed. The paramedics get the stretcher and I gotta let go of the kid's hand. I tell him he's gonna be alright, but I just don't know.

The adrenaline is dying down. I probably stink like a goddamn dumpster. And I'm alone with my thoughts. I couldn't stand it, so I wrote this, because I want you to know that if this kid's a paraplegic, it's my fault.  


TL;DR: A kid in a really bad collision was knocked out. Power lines were dangerously close to snapping. His truck is leaking gasoline and there's a potential for fire as well as electrocution. I made the decision to pull him out because I couldn't bear the thought of him burning to death or being electrocuted. But even after the ambulance had picked him up and taken him, no fire started and no power lines snapped, and I may have simply made his spine worse.

My (16m ) gf (17f) is 8 months pregnant with my daughter. Is my life actually over?,"Ok so I'm trying to make the best of a not so good situation. My gf who I've known for basically forever (been official since I was 14) is having my baby. Everyone especially my parents keep telling me I fucked up big and my life is over. They say I'm a loser and I'll never get anywhere in life. They say I'll never be happy again. How true is that?

I keep telling myself there's gotta be good things about babies otherwise people wouldn't keep having them since lots have them in purpose. 

I'm pretty much freaking out at this point. I have a fuck ton of mixed feelings about the whole thing. Obviously I don't want to be a dad BUT Im gonna be. So it is what it is. 

My parents are being difficult and not making things easier, in fact making it worse. Since I told them she was pregnant they said since I'm making adult decisions I now have adult responsibilities. They make me pay rent, part of hydro/cable/internet/water etc. I have to buy my own food and anything I need. I have a part time job but they now take the entire paycheque and are insisting I'm in the negative each month and owe them a couple grand. I have legit not been able to buy a single baby thing cuz of them.

I desperately needed shoes but since they take all my money I had none. I was wearing little bros shoes since he's cool but they're too small. Gfs parents bought me a new pair since I got an infected toenail from being squished. I don't want to owe them too, JC.

Anyway. I'm leaving home once school is done in June. Gf's parents said I won't have to pay them rent as long as I help with the baby and contribute with that.

My parents say they'll sue me for the money I owe them. Can they? When I get mad they just say I'm an adult and I get adult consequences now.

TIFU Update: coming home for lunch and giving my girlfriend 2 black eyes,"Link to previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/diwxpg/tifu\_by\_coming\_home\_for\_lunch\_and\_giving\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/diwxpg/tifu_by_coming_home_for_lunch_and_giving_my/)

I wasn't expecting to make an update post when I posted the first story, but it blew up a bit so I'm here with a small (happy!) update.

First, I took the advice on my last post and sent my girlfriend to a spa to get all sorts of stuff done, including a manicure, as an apology.

My girlfriend's eyes healed fairly quickly so I put my plan into motion yesterday. I took her to dinner at our favorite fancy restaurant and got down on one knee while we were waiting for our dessert. She was very excited and said yes before I could even ask :) The waiter took some really beautiful pictures of it and I'm so glad I waited until her eyes healed because she was really excited to show the pics to our families. Then I took her to her mom's house for a little engagement celebration. I'm pretty sure she knew it was coming when I sent her to the spa, but she pretended to be surprised. It was a really great night, and thankfully I didn't ruin it completely with my fuck up last week!

tl;dr gave my girlfriend 2 black eyes, proposed after they healed, now she's my fiancee!",tifu
TIFU by overestimating my tolerance to weed by a LONGSHOT.,"TL;DR I took too many edibles, tripped out.

Obligatory it was yesterday yadda yadda yadda.

So to start off I would like to say that I smoke weed about 3-4 times a week. I smoke maybe a gram, or more with friends. I have never smoked so much that I lost control of myself, or couldn't function. I have never thrown up from smoking too much, so I would like to consider myself a heavy weight. However, I had never tried edibles.

I decided to make some at home, because I like cooking, and I decided to make an omelet with canabutter. The recipe said around 4 grams of high THC concentrated grams of weed. I grow my own, and pride myself on a cannabis plant with high THC content, but 4 grams for 1 WHOLE CUP of butter and half a cup of water?!?!? That seemed absurd, and I was eating w a friend, so I used 4 grams for 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of water, thinking I will just be careful with dosing. I invited A, as in ONE, friend over, (let's call him Jason)and we made the omelet. I added about 2 tablespoons of the cannabutter, blended and cooked for a long amount of time I might add, or approximately half into the actual egg mixture (4 eggs and a couple table spoons of sour cream w some spices). I then added a very little bit to melt on the pan, but I thought it couldn't hurt so I added more. Also, the whole time I was thinking my friend would help me finish it.

I made the omelet, we dug in, and then we quickly drove to a nearby chili's because we knew they were strong, and we didn't want to drive under the influence. I got there, and barely ordered our water when everything hit me all at once. I felt like the air became corn syrup. The waitress was standing right next to me, and then I blinked, and I swear on my mother she just teleported to the other side of the table. My friend was obviously also high as a kite. It's hard to explain how high I was, and then I played some games on the little Ipad they had. I sat there, and I kept thinking about how I had to say something or else it would be awkward. Then I started freaking out when one of my other friends got here(I'll go with Clarissa), I had invited her prior but she does not partake in weed. I forgot my Jason was there, because in my mind I only had one friend sitting down w me at Chili's. Then I turned an saw my Jason, and he was just smiling. He said he felt like there were hooks in his cheeks holding his smile up, but it felt good. I asked Clarissa whether or not she felt as if the service was taking forever, but she told me she just sat down. I felt like she was gaslighting me, because I could have sworn we were there for like a  couple hours. I said I needed to take a piss, so I started walking to the bathrooms. That is when I walked into the girl's restroom. Luckily nobody was there, but I was so confused until I realized it was the women's restroom due to the lack of urinals. After washing my hands in what felt like water so hot it was freezing cold I went back to my table. As I sat down, both of my friends were gone. I thought, in my state, they had somehow gotten lost at the table, I honestly don't know how but I distinctly remember thinking that I had to find them or else they would be lost forever. I found my way back to our car, and they were in there. I started knocking and telling them to let me in, but for some reason they wouldn't. Sick of their shit, I started slamming, saying,"" If you fuckers don't let me in I will break this glass."" Then, to my intense horror I realized this was in fact not our car, but somebody else's. I went back inside and sat down, my friends were there. They said they just watched me walk up to the table, say,"" I gotta find them."" and then walk outside. I can confidently say I was high even the next morning, which freaked me out even more. Safe to say I will follow recipes to the T from now on.

Edit: Now I'm kinda mad I used my throwaway account for this.

Edit: I get it, I'm not a heavyweight, hence my overestimation by a long shot. This has turned into a dick length contest- ""You think you're a heavyweight? I smoke 2 oz a week,"" or, "" You think you're a heavy weight? You are fucking stupid you small child, little dick, cunt. I smoke an 1/8 a day, and smoke wax constantly you fucking pussy. I also fucked your girlfriend."" Like jesus calm down.

Edit: Many people doubt this story due to me not describing how I made the cannabutter, all I can say is that this is the story of how I fucked up, not how I made cannabutter. If you must know, yes I decarbed it (55 minutes at 220, in between foil on a baking pan) , then blended, and cooked it in a pan till it browned, dark brown close to a burnt smell, but not. I then blended it again. I didn't have cheescloth to strain, so I didn't extract the weed, just blended it in.  the strain was sour diesal.

Does a child who didn't see one parent because the other parent stole them despite custody orders in place have to repay that time debt after age 18? Oregon,"Posting anonymously because I think I know the answer but feel like an idiot asking anyway. I hope I describe this clearly.

My parents split when I was very young and had shared custody about 50/50 at the time. My mother ran off with me to Canada not long after but cancer took her when I was 15. I was taken back to my father and was always told because I was away from him for eight years but he had 50/50 custody then I had to repay that time debt for four years after I turned eighteen. I took it as just how things are.

There was a letter from dad's lawyer that I haven't been able to find that I had when I came back to him pointing out I would be a minor until after I turned 22 and a few months. I'm not allowed to leave home much except to work, dad gets all of my money to support me, I'm not allowed to see guys, I'm not allowed a car, and it seems really unfair to me, and nobody else my age is in this situation. Does any of this seem legally real? The more people I talk to the more it seems my dad has me under a big con but I'd like to know for sure. I know it might be trying to prove a negative but is there a link to a law I could use to show for sure either way?

TIFU by trying to remove my body hair,"So this just happened 20 minutes ago and to be honest I'm still not sure if I'm okay so any doctors out there that might read this, lemme know!

So, every summer I usually do a Nair hair removal on my body, from like upper stomach to mid thigh. I've been doing it for a few years to achieve that smooth as a baby dolphin skin, so i know my skin is not sensitive or allergic to this product. 

Now, the Nair I buy comes with this [little white sponge.](https://imgur.com/a/juqaAMx) This helps basically ""wash the hair away"" by rubbing it off. I typically wash mine after every use. 

I recently went on a lake trip and I did my whole regime before I left. When I came back (as I was gone for quite some time) I noticed I missed a few spots and plus it was going to be date night soon so I figured *what the hell, I'll do a bit more*

I was putting away my laundry after I came home, and found my sponge mixed in with my clothes. I set it aside, grabbed my clothes and lathered up with Nair. I waited my standard 5 or so minutes and hopped in the shower. Grabbed my sponge, and started rubbing. 

*oh my god*. At first, nothing was amiss. I'm rubbing, and the hair is coming off (in pretty good chunks but hey the product is working!). As I finish my front, I start to move to my backside. My literal backside. 

And then, it feels like I'm on fire. I go to wipe over a spot I already did and almost fall to my knees in pain. By now, I've almost finished my entire backside; back, lower butt and all. And it feels like my skin is eating itself. 

Let's pause here and take a trip down my own TIFU memory lane. About 10 years ago, I was young and had a sick birthday party with awesome temporary tattoos that I put everywhere. I had forgotten about them until it was time to go to school Monday morning, and in a *holy shit everyone is going to make fun of me for having a pirate temporary tattoo on my cheek* induced moment, I grabbed the Mr.Clean Magic Eraser from under our kitchen sink and scrubbed my face as vigorously as possible. 

Now for those who don't know what a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is, lets just say it's a small white sponge that packs the power of all the Greek Gods in it to remove any stain on any surface. I thought it would be a great move to scrub my skin with it, and boy was I wrong. The skin around my cheek melted off in some sort of disgusting science experiment and scabbed, leaving everyone to call me ""zombie girl"" for weeks. Safe to say, I am traumatized and know *exactly* what that sensation feels like. 

Okay, back to the present. So here I am, skin burning and glaring red. I finish my shower, change into the loosest clothes I own, and lay down to cry. As I'm in bed, my grandfather comes over and says ""hey, I cleaned the bathroom and threw my magic erasers in with your laundry. Did you find them when you put away your clothes?"" 

And that my friends, is the moment I had a flashback of my zombie face trauma, and knew I had made the biggest FU of my life, twice

And of course, here's the [proof on my body. ](https://imgur.com/a/T0zSFdF)

TLDR; Used a magic eraser to take off my hair removing product. Gave myself ptsd as I have done this before, and now I have chemical burns all over my body.

EDIT: Yes I am a female and yes females grow hair everywhere on their body, believe it or not!! I am also not a fan so hence me trying to remove it. Let's move on people. Much thanks to everyone who gave me healing suggestions! And hearts out to the people who have experienced similar situations :)

EDIT 2: sorry y'all, TIL there is not chemicals in Mr. Clean Magic Erasers, I genuinely though there was. What I am describing is a case of rubbing my skin raw mixed in with Nair, which is definitely a chemical. So my apologies.",tifu

AITA for allowing the girls on my HS track team (I'm the new head coach) wear bikini tops and cut off shorts for a fund raising car wash?;,"This is very fresh, posting from my phone and a throwaway because I'm honestly nervous about how big this is going to get. I just got an email from the assistant superintendent of the entire district that I have to be in his office Monday morning and I'm scared shitless. 

Basically I just graduated college and got my teaching certificate last year. The school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so I volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this. We have some very talented girls and I enjoy it. 

We were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. On Monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. They argued it was for thier comfort since it's about 80 here today. I was a little nervous but agreed. Apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. I'm so naive I thought initially people were just being charitable but when I saw boys from surrounding schools I knew somthing was up. And it wasn't long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. The girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made.

So, I tried it. I thought that maybe I was being too close minded and so I went for it. It went fine, but it still really isnt my thing. But here's the bad part.

She didnt like it at all. Even though we were slow, used condom and lube, she said it was uncomfortable. This would be fine, and something that we could move on from, but she is blaming me. She says that I sabotaged it because I didnt want to do it. But i didnt. I did it exactly how she asked me to, in terms of speed, how hard i went, plus the amount of lube used. She was really the director here. But somehow it's my fault she didnt like it.

Im pretty livid about this. I went out on a limb to try something i didnt want to, just to make her happy. And I feel like after all that she is finding a way to make this my fault. It feels like she built this up in her head too much, and since it didnt live up to it she assumes I ruined it on purpose. We had a fight over this and we broke up.

Update! [California] Neighbour constantly blocking my wheelchair access ramp,"[Here's the link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6dj4qh/california_neighbour_constantly_blocking_my/?st=j8u5lhg8&sh=e0c0b34e)

Hello!

The person who directed me to this legal help forum mentioned that it's customary to give updates once significant progress is made in a case. So, since I'm currently sitting in a car, still a couple hundred miles away from home, this is as good a time as any to tell you guys what's been going on. :)

Following your advice I contacted the authorities to have the area around the ramp marked out as a no-parking spot. They weren't able to help me since the street is owned by my neighbourhood's homeowner association. Now, my house is one of the few in the area that is not part of that organisation, but I decided to contact them anyway. The president turned out to be a wonderful lady who was of immense help to me. She helped resolve the parking situation by designating the area around the ramp as a no-parking spot. I felt bad about inconveniencing my neighbours, but the homeowner association agreed to my idea of extending the street parking zone by a few yards on the other side of my neighbours' house, that way they still have somewhere to park their fifth car. She did all that as a gesture of goodwill without me being a member of their organisation, which made me fall in love with the neighbourhood even more. Also, I'm really glad I didn't have to involve the police.

Since my accessibility issue has been resolved I've decided to pull the trigger and buy the house I live in. I'm currently in the process of finalising the purchase which is taking slightly longer than usual due to a complex ownership situation, still at this point my estate agent is assuring me that there should be no more roadblocks, which makes me really happy. Once I'm the owner of the house I'm planning to join the homeowner association as well. I've also been asked to become their accessibility consultant to help make sure all of their future projects are wheelchair friendly, which is a huge honour to me and makes me confident that this is the right place for me. :)

On top of all that, I've reached an agreement with the homeowner association and two other couples to build a second ramp a little further down the street and split the cost between all of us. Every party, including the homeowner association will be covering a quarter of the price and we have a promise that this time a no-parking spot will be marked out immediatelly. :) The project is set to begin once the purchase of my house is finalised.

Thanks once again for all your help! What started out as a nuisance has become a fantastic adventure that reassured me that I've found a place I can truly call home!",legaladvice
TIFU by ejaculating in my bed,"Throwaway obviously. This is a few months old but I feel like I have to get it out of my head.

So I know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but I've always done it in bed. I am living with my parents so I guess I just like the privacy of my room. Then - and this is what I now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time I would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. I never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so I just kept doing it because it was easy... Nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.

After some years of doing this I recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. I used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that's why it didn't smell?) but for a couple of weeks I started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. This usually wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since I was always ejaculating on my wall/bed I began to get a bad cockroach infestation there. 

I didn't notice at first and since I've never had cockroaches before I didn't really know what they were but eventually I read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... At first I felt really disgusted. I wanted to exterminate them but I definitely didn't want my parents to find out what happened, so I tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. But then I felt really bad.



I don't know why but it felt like murder. I didn't really dislike the cockroaches. I had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. So I decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point I finally began masturbating in the shower). I know this sounds really weird but I kind of began thinking of them as my children. It started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. Like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. I actually want kids when I grow up. And this was kind of like that - I used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and I just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.



Then my parents found out. I think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while I was at school. 



So we had to move out for about a week to an Airbnb and I was really depressed the entire time but I couldn't tell them why. They thought I just didn't like the Airbnb.

TL;DR I jerked off onto the wall and got a cockroach infestation",tifu
Update: I make payments on a horse. The owner is extremely elderly. What happens contractually if she passes away?,"More than two years ago, I made a post on here about purchasing a horse via a contract that stipulated monthly installments because there was literally no chance of me being able to afford him up front. The seller was an elderly woman and I was asking about what would happen should something happen to her, since she was obviously the party that I was making payments to. I was pretty afraid of paying thousands of dollars on an animal and then having a potential heir situation dispute my ownership interest.     
I had full interest transferred to me after the first payment so it was like buying a property that was owner-financed, I guess—I just made payments directly to the seller. I recently saw on Facebook that the seller was having health challenges, so I rushed and paid off my balance with her a few months early. I have some experience in the field of elder law and I have noticed that when one thing happens to an old body, there tends to be a tragic domino effect. I didn't want to get caught in a situation where there was any potential for conflict; I just wanted a pony...I have now cleared my debt to her and the horse's papers are en route to me via his breed registry, to be transferred into my name. The seller's health has since improved in while she is still pursuing some treatments, she is still absolutely as sharp as a whip and we enjoyed a nice telephone call this week.       
As for the horse: he is one hundred percent of my sanity and my life is much improved with him in it. He is gorgeous and exactly what the seller promised me that he was. He is now twelve years old, which is the prime of a horse's life, and it shows. He is castrated, but I am in the process of contacting the owner of the sire to see if it would be possible to freeze some semen if said sire still fertile. I would like to help continue this unique bloodline, if that's possible, since both the seller of my horse and the current owner of the stud are ladies have an advanced age.     
My horse and I are planning to make a debut at a higher level in a FEI-affiliated event in January. Everything has worked out better than could've been hoped for. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and I'm excited to report that it may not be a train.

AITA for reporting my son's terrible school bus driver?,"My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he's been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. 

Two weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would ""try his best"". 

That afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said ""if you're going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.""

After that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. 

I called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would ""look into it."" After a couple more days, he hadn't stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that ""nobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he's the best one at the school"" (Which I sincerely doubt). 

I mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is ""the nicest guy you'll ever meet"" and that her children say my son is ""extremely disruptive"" on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn't be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.

My assets were almost split in a divorce that I was not a party of.,"TL/DR I own my own farm. My parents were in the middle of a very messy divorce. My mothers lawyer motioned to include my assets in my farm into their divorce. My step-father settled before it could get worse and the motion approved.

&#x200B;

I own my own farm in a family farm abundant state (ND). I am 25 and have a family of my own. I own 100% of the assets and memberships of my farm, besides renting very expensive machinery from him to farm my stuff, as I am new at it. My mother's attorney attempted to subpoena me, my insurance, my bank, as well as my other employer, who I work for to keep insurance on my wife and kids, and farming is very volatile right now. I of course objected to everything as quickly and efficiently as possible. Eventually, he subpoenaed me for a deposition, which did not go as well as I liked, because I did not want the invasion of privacy on my business like that. His farm expert was my mother who does not know anything about farming, and reacted as if my confusion to the questions were as if I was not farming, but as if my dad was farming for me. My stepfather could not farm a majority of his stuff as this same attorney encumbered him and he could not get a loan. I qualified for a government loan as a first time farmer and rented some land, equipment, and storage. I also found landlords that my stepfather was no part of whatsoever, in the sense that he never rented from them before. I also picked up my own land later in the year.

&#x200B;

After the deposition, my mother's attorney motioned to ""INCLUDE ASSETS OF ITHOMAS510 FARM IN MARITAL ESTATE.""

My mother's attorney continued to call my farm names such as ""alter ego"" and ""alleged operation"" in public court documents.

A week later my stepfather settled the case because of this and other things.  As I was not a party I could not submit anything whatsoever to defend myself or my business. I was completely defenseless and at the will of the judge and this attorney deciding what my family and my farm's future was going to be like. They attempted to include it into the marital estate with absolutely no financials, no proof of membership, no proof of anything really.

Do I have any sort of a case here? Legal Malpractice? Defamation? Slander of title? Heck, even emotional damages.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time.

&#x200B;

EDIT: 

I would like to first clarify that there was no transfer of assets into my name from my father. Everything I had was either built from an operating loan or a mortgage loan, both backed by the government through a grant which allowed me to borrow such amount of money. I did rent land from my father for above the normal rent price for our area as he could not farm it due to a lis pendans put on by my mother's attorney. The land I bought was bought from a different landowner. None of this was hiding assets or a sham.

I had gone through about 4 rounds of subpoenas to me and my banks to hand in all of my information for my farm. I objected to every one stating that there was no hidden assets and none of it was my father's, as well did the bank and my mortgage loan officer. This is probably why he went as far as a depostition.

The reason why the deposition did not go as planned was because the attorney and my mother did not have the farm knowledge to know the questions to ask. Some of the questions were similar to ""do you perform burn down?"" and ""what chemicals do you use on your farm."" I asked them to clarify all of these questions and explained myself but they used them as fake ""gotcha"" questions as I told them that they were too broad and didn't make any sense. There is also an issue where my mothers previous attorney contacted my father's landlords and he started to lose rented land. I did not want this to happen to my farm so I may have gotten a little hostile as I worked hard to network to get these landlords and did not want them being harassed. I did not try to be clever, slippery, or sneaky. He is an oil attorney and doesn't know anything about actual practices of farming, so when I said questions didn't make sense he twisted it into ""didn't make sense to me because I didn't know."" My attorney I had set up for the deposition had a heart attack, so I had to find one quickly, and he was basically there for the coffee.

I had stated to this attorney several times in affidavits and objections that all assets were mine, were never dad's before or now, as well did the banks and loan officers and he kept on sending subpoena's. I understand this is within his right as an attorney and is encouraged, but I do believe that as a person and business owner, I also have my own rights to privacy if I do choose.

I understand renting machinery was a slippery slope as ""if it's the same machinery then it must be the same farm."" None of his machinery was getting used by him due to the lis pendans. He recorded all checks written to him from me for the divorce. If I was not farming any of it, there would have been no money made between my parents on the farm. My rents at least put a little cash into their pockets.

I would not want to pursue action against this attorney further if I was ""hiding assets and being sneaky."" He had his right to due diligence. He did not have his right to include my assets into the court.",legaladvice
Update: I (34M) think my wife (32F) is cheating on me.,"Original post from a few weeks ago:I travel a lot for work. I'm usually gone Tuesday through Thursday 3 times a month. My wife is a stay at home mother for our two children 3 and 5. We have a nanny that helps out 4 days a week during the day, so that my wife can take care of her errands and shopping. 
About 6 months ago I caught my wife in a lie. Not a big lie just her telling me she was somewhere when I knew she wasn't. It bothered me but not to the point where I was extremely concerned. Then a week before the 4th of July I came home early from my trip I wanted to surprise her, the next day was the anniversary of the day we had met. I had also received a fairly large bonus two weeks earlier and was going to surprise her with the trip I booked for us to go to St Martin for a week. It was late when I got in from the airport around 11:30pm and we had FaceTimed about three hours earlier so I could see her and the kids. She never mentioned anything about going out that night. When I got home the nanny was there, she said to me that my wife had left about an hour and a half ago. I texted my wife asked her what she was up too, and she responded saying she was about to go to bed. I said thats funny because I just got home and you're not here. 
When she got home she was telling me that she was just out with two of her friends, she named them, and just didn't want me upset that she wasn't home with the kids (usually one of our parents would watch the kids at night we had never used the nanny before), I didn't really buy her excuse,  but I had no proof and she wasn't admitting to anything. 
The next day I ordered a gps tracker for her vehicle. I haven't told her about it. And since then I have caught her in several lies, and I'm not even trying to set her up. She is just telling me she is at one place and I can see she is clearly not. 
Should I confront her with what I did and why is she lying to me or hire a private investigator to get proof of infidelity if it is happening? 

TLDR I caught my wife in a lie so I got a gps for her car. Then I caught her in multiple lies.

I hired a private investigator, gave him a lot of information. My wife has been acting normal all day. We had plans tonight, I canceled told her I was not feeling well (which is the truth). I don't think anything else will happen until I leave Tuesday morning. I plan on calling my friend who is an attorney on Monday, even though he is not a divorce lawyer I'm sure he can point me in the right direction. Thanks for all the kind words and a few not so kind. I'll update when the PI does his thing.

Update: so I hired a private investigator to follow my wife when I left on Tuesday. He first followed her to the grocery store, he said he saw her purchase two visa gift cards. He told me that could be how she is paying the nanny for the extra time without giving her a check or CC. She left the house for a second time around 12:30 pm and went to the same location she has been going to. He witnessed an suv pull up and she got in. He followed the vehicle to a gated community where he lost sight of them. He was not able to view the driver due to the dark tint. He has a realtor license and used that to get in, but by the time he got to the house they were already inside. They were there for about 3.5 hours. He then saw my wife and another lady leave the house in the same vehicle, he followed them back to where my wife's car was parked. She went home and didn't leave the rest of the day.

Wednesday 8/14 she went to a few shops with the kids. That night around 9:15 (I FaceTimed her and the kids around 8:30) she left and went to the same location. She again met with the same women. This time they went to a restaurant and ate for a little over an hour, then back to her house til 1:15am. She was again dropped off at her car and then went home.

So there was no guy involved at least this week, but she never told me she was going out for dinner or anything. I really don't know what to do now. The PI was pretty expensive I'm not sure I want to hire him again. Not sure if I should confront her or just try an get more information on my own.

Update: so these last few weeks have been difficult. I kept the PI following her when I have been out of town. It has been the same thing she meets at the same place and the same woman picks her up. This Wednesday they went to dinner instead of her house. The PI got a photo of them embracing and a single kiss when they got to the place where my wife parks. The kiss is not something just friends would do. This is the first real evidence I have gotten, other than just strong suspicion. 
I flew home a day early, and last night I confronted her with the photos. I didn't tell her how I got them or that I had hired a PI. I asked her to explain why she was cheating and how long it had been going on. She basically denied everything and said that they were just friends. She then tried to accuse me of spying on her and invading her privacy. I couldn't believe it, even with the photos and her lying she wanted to blame me. 
I haven't moved forward with the divorce or anything yet, I'm still hoping she will come clean and tell me the truth.

Update: so I have the woman's name,age and where she works from the PI. She is single no kids, she has a Facebook account but no personal information on relationship status or recent posts or likes and she is not friends with my wife. No instagram or Twitter that he can find either. I think I'm done with him he found out enough.",relationship_advice

AITA for forcing a 6 year old kid to be separated from her parent on a flight?,"Title kinda sounds fucked up but hear me out lol

I recently was on an international flight and I always try to snag the window seat so I can sleep. A woman was seated next to me and asked if I could give up my seat since it turned out that her 6 year old was apparently seated in the row across. I tried to be nice about it and said, ""Sorry, but I specifically chose this seat and I don't really want to give it up, I've been traveling for hours.""

The woman's response was, ""Well so have we! Imagine traveling with an overtired kindergartener who now won't be able to sleep since she can't sit by her mom!"" She made me look like an asshole in front of the other people on the flight, and I felt bad since it was a little kid. I agree that it probably sucks to be traveling with a little kid, but AITA for not giving up my seat?

EDIT:

1. I was seated in the window seat, the woman was in the middle seat next to me, and another passenger was in the aisle seat next to her. 6 year old kid was across in the next row over in the aisle seat. Since the mother and the kid were only one seat away from each other, it wasn't so much an issue of not being seated next to each other, but more that the mom wanted her kid to have the window seat so she could sleep
2. This wasn't an issue of separation and the kid being scared. Her mom was ONE seat away. This was an issue of wanting the seat for her kid just so she could sleep
3. For those asking duration of the flight: 6 hours
4. For those asking ""Why didn't she ask the other person in the aisle seat?"" Because she specifically wanted the window seat for her child",AmItheAsshole

AITA for calling 911 on a friend for drunk driving?,"I've officially been booted from my social circle and flamed by all my friends. We are all military families with young children and we have get togethers every weekend which includes booze.

One of my friends will drive home, with her 4 month old in tow, drunk. She insists her house is too close to uber and refuses rides from the rest of us. Her husband is trashed too. 

Granted, she only lives 15 minutes away, but that's 15 minutes after shots and beer pong, sometimes stumbling and throwing up. 

Last Friday, she was almost blackout drunk. She tried to bring my dog home instead of her own kid. Her husband loaded their baby up and they were slurring as they drove away. I insisted they stay overnight but apparently their baby can't sleep anywhere but her own crib. I offered to drive and they kept saying no. My husband thinks it's not a big deal and all my friends kept telling me to chill, their house is so close by.

I picked up the phone and called 911 after sneaking into the bathroom. I gave them their license plate number and address. 

Apparently they blew really high BAC and child protective services are now involved. My friends are all livid with me and even my husband is pissed. No one wants anything to do with us and my husband keeps trying to explain to me that I violated friend code in the military community. I have been blocked by everyone on social media and we are furthermore uninvited to future get togethers. My husband is so mad!

I truly stand by what I did. Am I really the asshole here?! Everyone is so mad at me, am I just being a prude?! Help please

**Update:** Thank you so much everyone for your votes of confident. I do feel a lot better, and thank you for the gold! I am getting a lot of nasty messages saying that I ruined a family and I should be ashamed, but I think they would be worse off if they died.

An update on my personal life- we're being interviewed by military police. The higher ranking people in my husband's chain of command are really thankful that the report was made. The lower ranking ones (my husband's peers) are pretty livid and any thanksgiving or Christmas plans made with my family have been taken back. We're going to have to get used to outcast life for a while since we'll live here for at least another year. My husband has calmed down but he has barely spoken to me and has been sleeping on the couch.

I've deleted all my social media accounts for now just because I'm tired of being in the middle of this. I think I'm going to take a small vacation and stay with my parents in another state, until I can get my head on straight. 

**Update 2:** To answer some of the questions people had about why I didn't try harder. 

I couldn't be around to collect their keys. I finished my shift and come home around 11pm (I work at a restaurant) and I just wanted to shower. Everyone had already been partying for hours by now. The baby started to cry and the couple insisted they needed to go. I offered to get them an uber or they could have the pull out couch or even our bed. I tried to get an uber through the app but my husband told me I needed to stop nagging and leave them alone. It's not easy trying to convince a drunk person to stay if they insist on leaving.

No it didn't occur to me to slash their tires or break their car battery.

I don't know anything about calling their command. My husband is a first year in the military and graduated boot camp earlier this year.

I'm not trying to exaggerate how drunk they were, when I tried to get them to stay I could hardly make out what they were trying to say besides ""she needs her crib"" and ""our house is right there!"" 

To answer how they knew it was me, this isn't the first time I've tried to keep people from leaving a party before. There is a group text everyone is in and they asked me straight up if I made the call. I said I did. I didn't want to lie about it.",AmItheAsshole

Update: Neighbor touched my son,"  

Original Post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor\_touched\_my\_son\_nj/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor_touched_my_son_nj/)

I know the original post didn't get a lot of attention and there probably isn't much demand for an update, but I did want to thank the people who commented and maybe give some guidance on expectations for anybody who might have the horrible luck to fall into a similar situation. Also it's just not something we want to talk about with friends/family…. So call it therapy for me.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

TLDR for the 1st post: Last Monday, soon after I left for night school, my son (5) reported to my wife that our (deaf & mute) neighbor touched his private parts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Update: On Tuesday morning the entire family went to the police station to file a report. My wife and I interviewed with an officer and detective together at 1st and then my wife alone. After that the detective contacted the county prosecutor's office.

An hour or so later we were on our way to a county facility, so we could all be interviewed by a couple of detectives from the county prosecutor's office. Once interviews were over the county detectives sat down with my wife and I to let us know my son had given them some actionable information and they intended to act relatively quickly. The detective who interviewed the children had tears in her eyes. 

From there we went home.

That afternoon, Neighbor knocked on the door, looking to play with the kids. I opened the inner door (left the storm door closed) and made it clear he needed to go away, which he did. Soon after I went to night school, asking my wife to stay in doors with the kids for the night, which she did. When I got home, she said nothing else had occurred.

For the most part, Wednesday was quiet and relatively normal. We did not see Neighbor all day. Wednesday night, we came to know why. A detective called to let us know Neighbor had been taken into custody on Tuesday night (while I was at school) and would remain in custody for a few days until his hearing (I assume arraignment).

Thursday morning a woman from the state DCF/CP&P office came to the house. She made a cursory check of the house and interviewed my wife & I together. To my mind, this was actually a good thing.  She was able to let us know that Neighbor had been charged with 2 counts (I don't recall exactly what they are). She also provided 2 other important facts:

1 – Neighbor had a history, albeit old (late 80s, early 90s) and in California.

2 – Neighbor had admitted the act to the detective that arrested him on Tuesday evening.

From there, she advised we were entitled to have my son evaluated by a state specialist and possibly therapy if necessary. We will need to have them check in with us once a month until the case is closed on their end, and the evaluation etc. will necessarily extend that time frame, but we opted to go this route anyway.

While she was there I asked if she knew what the likely penalty was (she did not), and whether or not she thought we should pursue a restraining order, if Neighbor was likely to be free again soon. She was unsure and promised to check in with the detectives on the subject.

Friday (yesterday) afternoon, we received a call from the county detective. She informed us that Neighbor's hearing was set for Monday and that his lawyer intended to ask that he be released to his home, with an ankle monitor, for the period between the hearing and his trial. She wanted to ask for our input as to how hard the prosecutor should push to have Neighbor remain in custody.

Here's the thing. Neighbor, so far as we can tell, actually lives with a family… and they have small children. I advised the detective that we were ok with Neighbor being 'home', so long as he was confined to (approximately) his property. She confirmed that would be the case, and that a 'no contact' order would be in place. We agreed that was ok with us, but also said we felt strongly the family with whom Neighbor lives should have input.

That brings us up to date and, to be honest, I am torn. I HATE what this man did. I hate that it has happened before, and I never want it to happen again. With that said, at first I was unsure as to whether or not Neighbor even knew what he did. He clearly has some emotional/intellectual challenges. But he also knew, at least to some extent, what he was doing…. As he admitted the act to the arresting detective. I get the feeling he is something akin to a deaf/mute Lennie from Of Mice & Men, and that tears my heart out. I don't think he really understands, and I don't want to be vindictive to someone like that. At the same time, he touched my son. If there were no clear impairment, I would want to take a baseball bat to his head. But there is, and instead I just feel like shit for everyone involved. This sucks, full stop.

On a more selfish note, the Megan's law registry. There are a handful of homes for sale in the area. Until now, my wife and I were hopeful that more families with children would move into the area. That hope is now over. Because Neighbor's history all predates Mega's Law, he was not on the registry. Now he will be, and no families with kids will move into the area. I realize this is tangential to the main topic, and pretty self-centered, but it's just one more way that Neighbor is going to make our lives a smidge worse, just by existing. To repeat myself, this sucks, full stop.

Sorry for the book, and if the Mods see fit to remove the update… as it's not all that particular to legal matters, I understand. Honestly, I just feel a bit better getting it all down and putting it out there.

Thanks to anyone who reads through.",legaladvice
AITA for breaking a kids Airsoft gun,"I was walking home from school about two weeks ago when I noticed two kids in my neighboorhood shooting at a dog with an airsoft gun. The dog was trapped in a garden where the owner of the dog had set up a small fence around so the dog could run free, but not escape.

These kids kept shooting at the dog, so I told them to stop. As these were two bratty, maybe 10-13 year old kids they just laughed at me and kept shooting. I then walked up to the kid and grabbed his gun and he got scared and promised not to do it anymore.

However when I was walking home again the other day I found the same kids shooting at the same dog again. I therefor got mad and walked up the kids and grabbed his gun again. However this time he just laughed and asked me what I was going to do about it. So I threw his plastic gun into a stone wall nearby and I am pretty sure I broke the thing for good.

Edit1: Here's an update. As I said in a reply to one of the comments, I have contacted the owner of the dog. However he is very old and doesnt want to do much, probably because he is too tired.
Also I have not seen the kids, but if I ever see them do anything I will find their parents this time.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by accidentally posting a topless picture on social media.,"This actually happened today! I put my 16 month old to bed at about 7:45. At 8:45 I checked his video monitor and was surprised to see him wide awake. He was creepily staring into the camera with his eyes whited out by the night vision. I took a screen shot of the video and posted it to social media. I typically have the camera zoomed in so you only see his crib, but if you zoom out the rocking chair next to his crib is in frame as well. I just usually can't see it. This is relevant. 

Here is where I fucked up. The monitor detects crying and grabs a 5 second video when it is detected. These are located in a queue at the bottom of the screen with a thumbnail for the video. After a bit I get back on social media and happen to review my post. The thumbnails are visible in the screen shot and I'm very obviously topless and sitting in his rocking chair in the very first thumbnail  (just got out of the shower and hadn't put on clothes when he started crying) I have no clue if anyone caught it, but it was super easy and clear to see. I completely forgot that you can see more of his room than just his crib. My brain will now spiral out of control all night while I ponder who has seen my boobs tonight.

TIFU by not knowing what a queef was,"Like all other posts on this sub, this did not happen yesterday, but about 10 years ago when I was in my sexual prime. Now before I begin, it should be noted I'm an only child. Therefore I had no sibling to teach me about the birds and the bees, and my parents worked ALL the time. They both worked C-Level jobs at big companies so I hardly ever saw them. Everything I know about sex today is through experience and the wonderful world of the internet.

So at this time in my life, I had already had sex with a small handful of girls. Being only 18, I thought I was hot shit. My life consisted of throwing parties at my parents vacant mansion and sex. Every 18 year olds' dream right? Well at one of my parties a group of college girls showed up (I was still a senior in high school) and the hottest girl of the college group was giving me vibes that she wanted to get it on. One thing let to another and we head up stairs..

Everything started off normal, foreplay and what not, when I finally got her naked I spread her legs so I could go down on her (I like to be a gentlemen and please the girl first). As soon I get down to that region she lets out the smallest ""toot"". Confused, I looked back up at her and she is still in a moaning bliss waiting for me to start as nothing happened. ""Did she just fart on me?"" I thought to myself. She was still begging for it so I shrugged my shoulders and we got it on.

Fast forward a week and we're now kind of ""dating,"" still having sex at least twice a day like new couples do. And each time she would let out a small ""toot."" I liked her a lot and didn't want to freak her out by asking her about it, so I decided to go to my friends (bad idea). They proceed to tell me that she's known as being a ""freak"" in bed and I just need to along with it. 

Ok here's when the actual fuck up happens... so that night we start fooling around and this time she wants to go down on me first. She's giving me the typical BJ when she goes down a little further for a little ball play... that's when I cock my legs up and release the biggest fart I could muster. I swear her hair flew back as if she had her face in front of a fan. She immediately stops what she's doing and looks back at me in disgust. I smiled with pride and said ""that's all for you babe."" 

She locked herself in my bathroom and cried until she let me call one of her friends to come pick her up. 

TL;DR: Didn't know what a queef was and thought my girlfriend was farting during sex as a fetish. I returned the ""favor"" by farting in her face when she was going down on me.

The double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. Why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/eM28YFrMdfI?t=9

here's a youtube video of SNL making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

There's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

Girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

Girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. Again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

Girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and EI is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

Therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. Because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is LEAGUES apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. Since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. It would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

Neither is acceptable. The double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is MALES who are underdeveloped for that age period. If there were a progressive victim stack, MALES should be ahead of FEMALES on the list because of the developmental delay.

>its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

>also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

>should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

>society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

Her mother back in aus had to spend 30k on lawyers and fly over to the US to try and get her sent back home.

We need to let some pet breeds die out.,"We have destroyed what were once great creatures by selective breeding, and we need to let some of our ""creations"" die out.

Breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

Of course I don't mean all breeds of animals when I say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds I do mean:

French Bulldogs, Pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: These dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. Being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

Munchkin Cats: Munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. If they had no health risks, I still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. But, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (Hollowed chest), and lordosis (Curved spine).

This isn't even hard to achieve. Simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

But I doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

Edit: I posted this very early in the morning, I know I wrote ""car"", but I did not mean that! I think I meant cat.

UPDATE: WIBTA If I cancelled our wedding?,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cuvkw3/wibta_if_i_cancelled_our_wedding/

TLDR at the bottom! 

Hello, all! It's been some time since I laid out all the bullshit my fiance and I were dealing with in regards to planning our wedding and such. We were so overwhelmed with the immense response and support, so, thank you to everyone who contributed and offered advice. Now, on to what happened! 

My fiance and I talked it through, the pros and cons, etc. We both realized how unhappy we were with how things were going and decided that we were going to cancel the wedding and move forward with eloping. We decided that we didn't want it to be just us, but a small group of family and friends as well. We were both ecstatic, but, also EXTREMELY worried at how our parents were going to take it. Especially considering our guest list went from over 120 people, to 20. But, we were both committed and he decided to tell his parents and I would then tell mine. 

Surprisingly, his parents were SO supportive and extremely ecstatic that we were getting eloped. They were even more excited when we let them know we wanted them there and they booked their flight soon after! They also handled telling their families and friends in Texas that we were eloping and to get over it. So, that saved us the trouble! His other family was very supportive and wished us the best. My father also was incredibly supportive and couldn't wait to be there. My mother on the hand, was FURIOUS.

The phone call to her started off calmly enough and I did let her know before beginning the conversation that she most likely wouldn't enjoy this. But, I pressed forward. I told her our reasons, our stresses, how we felt disrespected and disregarding concerning everything, I laid it all out in a calm and collected manner. Once finished, she was very quite and simply said, alright. I knew immediately that I was pretty well fucked, but, we ended the phone call with her stating she understood. 

Less than 24 hours later, she texts me asking if my brother (whom one of our biggest stressors was about) was invited. I was pissed because I had just had this conversation with her and explicitly told her who was invited and etc. I responded back with a simple no and that my father, grandmother and herself were invited. Well, shit hit the fan.

She sent me a wall of texts, calling me all sorts of names, throwing my fiance's family in my face and how we took their side, how I never truly gave a shit about her feelings, all the good stuff. I remained calm and before sending each response, consulted my fiance as to not sound like a total bitch. Long story short, she said unless my brother is invited, she won't be coming. So, I told her not to come. I was over it and stopped responding to her texts. 

For days she texted me, saying all the same as before and kept asking if my brother was invited. I responded once and told her that until she apologized (she won't) that I wouldn't be seeing or speaking to her about anything regarding the wedding. I offered an open seat to our wedding, whether she shows or not, is completely up to her. 

My fiance and I have already booked a small venue for our elopment and are more excited planning this than our previous wedding and are looking forward to our future! 

TLDR: We are eloping, bitches!

WIBTA if I ask my pregnant wife to stop calling me at work and ask me to come home just to cry about random things?,"I'm from Finland so my English is a bit rusty.

My wife is pregnant with our twin children. She recently took a break from her job because she's too tired to work and it is a high risk pregnancy.

I work as the managing director of a company and my job stresses me out. I only take important calls. My wife doesn't generally call me but I do talk to her whenever she does. She calls if she wants to talk or if she wants me to bring anything for her to eat. 

A couple of weeks ago, she called me and started crying. She wanted me to come home ASAP. I was shit scared and rushed home cancelling all appointments for the day. And when I got home, I was really surprised. She was crying because the neighbours dog died. I'm not even kidding. I was really scared but it was nothing. 

This has been happening for a couple of weeks. She calls me and asks me to come over. But it always ends up being nothing. I really can't take this stress. I have to go back to to work again. So I discussed with my secretary because she was kind worried and she thinks I'm kind of being insensitive and I should be more understanding. WIBTA here?",AmItheAsshole
Landlord is shouting at pet sitter,"I live in Massachusetts.  My wife and I have been renting the same property for at least eight years.  We've always had a cat, which was permitted when we moved in.  The landlord lives on the second floor of the house, in a different apartment.

We go away on weekends with some regularity, and at the end of one such weekend this year, our landlord cornered my wife outside (I was such inside the bathroom...) and started claiming that we had a non-permitted second cat (untrue,) and said that we shouldn't have a cat if we weren't going to stay home and take care of it.  He went on to say that he didn't want us giving spare keys to anybody, which is obviously a requirement for a pet sitter.

We didn't believe he had the power to make such rules, and decided to just keep doing what we were doing, and look for a house on the side (the housing market near Boston is its own horror story.)  Well, this weekend, our sitter texted to report that when he went to the apartment, our landlord spotted him and started shouting at him.  We don't have the full story yet, but we do know that the kitty was fed.

I was unable to find any specific laws or posts about this situation.  Do we have rights to distribute keys and hire sitters under the law?  ",legaladvice

Employer forcing us to pay for parking that we don't use.,"My wife and I work for a hospital (Ontario, Canada) which has just implemented a policy that all staff will pay for a monthly parking pass at the main campus of the hospital. This will cost us approximately $1000 per year.

My wife and I both work off site, where parking is free. Also another couple that we know that works for the hospital only owns one car, yet both are expected to pay the monthly parking fee, and others we know walk or take the bus to work also have to pay for a monthly parking pass. 

This seems like robbery to me... It has nothing to do with standards of practice (like wearing scrubs), and driving is not an essential part of job duties for most at the hospital.

[UPDATE] Someone I've never met claims they own my house," Hi everyone –
 
I can't thank you enough for all your advice on my last post: ""Someone I've never met claims they own my house"".  This is the first update, and I'm hopeful there will just be one more after this, wrapping everything up so we can put this behind us.  This is what has happened since my last post:
 

After the initial letter from the law firm saying they can represent us, we started getting phone calls from other firms, saying they'd been alerted to the Lis Pendens and could also represent us.  We were not super happy with this and asked how they got our cell number.  They said they subscribe to a service that alerts them when things like liens, foreclosures etc. are filed on a property. We hung up.
 

We looked at all our documents from the closing and confirmed that we do indeed have homeowner's title insurance (yay!).  Our deed is a ""Bargain and Sale"" deed, for those wondering. We also pulled all deed/mortgages and other documents for our property going back to 1972 online.  The last action was when we bought our house – no documents have been filed since.  I signed up on ACRIS to be alerted to any changes made to the property documents (thank you for the redditor who suggested that).  I also emailed the DA for my county, and their economic crimes bureau head emailed me back to ask for my cell number to follow up with me.  I gave it to him, but he hasn't called yet, so maybe that will be in the next (and hopefully final) update.

 
My husband met with our lawyer this morning, and I asked him to speak about all the things that you all suggested in the last post. Prior to the meeting, our lawyer had reached out to the firm who filed the Lis Pendens, and actually got a copy of the court transcript where the con man said he owns our property.  According to the transcript, he claims he bought it in 2016.  Our lawyer called their law firm and basically said ""Where is the deed?""  They supposedly hemmed and hawed about it, so we're starting to think they don't have it, and never did!  They may just be going off the words of a sleezeball who's like ""Yeah, I totally own that place.  I even have a deed for it.  No, you can't see it.""  It's possible that based off this alone, they filed against our property. 
 

In addition, it's not like this guy is saying he bought our house last week and the paperwork just hasn't been filed yet, he claims he bought it 3 YEARS AGO and there is STILL no paperwork filed to attest to this fact. (I was able to pull up all records for our home going back nearly 50 years, in about 15 minutes online).  Our lawyer does not like the way this other firm is handling this, and basically said to them ""You have no grounds for this.  Take it off.""
 

The attorney handling this case at that law firm is out of the office today and tomorrow,  but will be calling our lawyer back on Friday.  I am hopeful that it will just be a matter of ""Take the Lis Pendens off."" And ""Ok"".  I'll update again after the call between the lawyers. I told my husband the number 1 question is ""Where. Is. The. Deed?""  When we initially spoke with them, they clearly said they had it in hand, which is part of the reason I was freaking out. I honestly just want to be done with this, so getting back at the suing law firm for gross negligence (or whatever term fits the issue) is of no interest to me at the moment.  If they give us a hard time about removing the Lis Pendens, then we'll see.
 

So far my takeaway from this that I would share with anyone going through something similar is that law firms are made up of people.  And just like people can be good and smart and kind (like all of you!) they can also be dumb, shifty and lazy, and not bother to do their due diligence even though that's like 50% of why they exist in the first place (but I'm not bitter……).
 

Thank you all so much for your help,  I'll update again as things progress and hopefully conclude.",legaladvice
Update sister took $250K from mother with dementia,"original post is nearly a year old.

Mother passed away, and within a week older sister & caretaker of mom for 2 years had gotten our mother with dementia to sign over $250K, bought a house, put it in her name, and had about $20K left over that she kept, and hid it from me for a year.  She realized I had a good idea of the value of our mother's estate and admitted it to me.

I tried to work with her, and get her to pay out the other siblings what their fair share of the $250K would have been to them/us, she refused and cut off communication.

I filed a police report for financial elder abuse, the detective just emailed me, he subpoena'd medical & financial records, and is having sister come in for an interview in the next week.

She said she was trying to make him happy. I told her not to do that because that's something only her mother should do. She said she does it when her mom isn't home. I asked how often does her mom leave them by themselves. She said a lot.

We confronted my sister when she came back and she got mad. She thinks an eight year old is old enough to stay home alone. She says she fixes some food and bottles before she leaves. My niece just does the breastfeed thing to comfort him because it's what she has seen my sister do. My sister doesn't think there's anything wrong with it. My parents were furious. She snapped and said if we are so concern then why don't we just take them. My mom hit back saying that we didn't birth them therefore we aren't the ones who should have to take care of them.

"AITA for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiancé that I cheated 9 years ago?","For reference, my brother Connor is 19, I am 26, and my (now ex) fiancé Hunter is 28. Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

Connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it'd be fun to act like college students again.

We all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement ""Never Have I Ever cheated before"" came up.

Now's a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fiancé cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my ""boyfriend"" of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

Well my brother knows about this so when I didn't drink, he went ""hey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex's name*). You have to drink to that!""

My boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. I followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn't haven't any of it and ended things on the spot. I'm numb. I'm heartbroken. He was my everything and more and I still don't know how I'm going to move on.

Connor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn't mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn't think when he said those words. I just can't look at him right now. He ruined my life.

"""You can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea."," Let me preface this by saying I do believe in being grateful for what you have. But there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. I hate this for several reasons.

1. The people who say this almost never have it worse. They are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. I have a disability that limits my ability to walk. I don't complain about it much but I've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. I'm aware of that, but I've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. By the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. Complaining solves problems. Now, I can't speak for everyone with a disability, but I personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. In fact, I'm probably the best person you can complain to. I've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and I grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, I might be able to help. 

4. Also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. So even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. Look it up.

5. Those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. Considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if I do it right. After all, isn't that what protesting is? Complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. It's used to silence people who need help. I don't think I need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. It's human nature to complain. It just is. 

Just something I had to get off my chest, thanks.

"My brother (15M) has been lying about my (25M) life to my conservative, estranged parents, MADE FAKE INSTAGRAM, HELP","Ok I'll try to make this quick but there's a lot and I'm freaking the fuck out.

I grew up a Jehovah's Witness. If you don't know, JW are extremely conservative to an insane degree--I wasn't allowed to read Harry Potter, if that makes sense. And my parents were not lax or exceptions-for-my-children type. Extremely devout people. And I'm gay.

When I was sixteen I was outted horribly by my sister who found some gay porn that I didn't delete from my computer history. My family, of course, flipped out and demanded I either seek conversion therapy or get out. Luckily for me, my aunt had also defected from the church, so I was able to move in with her (FAR away).

My parents and sister immediately wanted nothing to do with me. But my brother was six. He was too young to really grasp what was going on, and had no phone or social media or anything, so I couldn't contact him. I honestly just assumed he drank the same end-is-nigh Kool-Aid and never sought him out.

Earlier this year, I got a message from him on Facebook. It was a gigantic apology for not saying goodbye properly, and that he really wanted me back in his life. Clicking through his profile, I didn't see any JW proselytizing like my sister's--just pics of him and his friends being normal teens. I was beyond happy. I messaged him back, we FaceTimed, cried, he caught me up a little in his life and I caught him up a little in mine. And from there we started texting regularly. I am very, very happy about all this. But he was still living under my parents' roof, and was still heavy in JW culture. I was nervous about this. He always reaffirmed that he only called/texted when he wasn't in the house (or around other JW), and reaffirmed that he thought the church was awful.

Last week something weird happened. I got an e-mail from my mother. It was a picture from a recent Dells trip she had taken with my family and another JW family. Years of no contact, then this. What the fuck? I spent DAYS talking this out with my friends before it occurred to me that my brother might have something to do with this.

I brought up the e-mail to my brother when I called him yesterday, barely hinting at my suspicions at all, and he unloaded. He had been lying to my parents. He said that *I* contacted *him* apologizing and was desperate to get back in contact with the Witnesses again, but was too ashamed. But the kicker is he made a FAKE INSTAGRAM to show them. He plucked all the G-rated pictures from my various social medias and filled it in with captions about how devout I am, how happy I am to have refound God's light, etc. He had taken pictures of me and my best friend, Julie, and added captions like ""the love of my life"", ""my bride-to-be"" etc. like HOLY shit. He seemed already remorseful of this ploy but that he was in too deep to stop now.

Now, he didn't say as much, but the obvious implication here is that he thought he could get my family back together. But this isn't a fucking sitcom or *The Birdcage*, he's catfishing his very emotionally unstable and religious zealot parents into thinking their faggot outcast son was reconverting. I have NO intentions of being in their life ever again, but I'd like to remain in my brother's life, and I don't want this incident to scare him off or sever the small bits of contact we have now.

So what do I do? I will not be contacting my parents, nor will I pretend to be straight. Obviously I need to tell him to close the account and stop talking about me to them, but what else if anything?

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

I don't want my twin sister in my wedding party and my mom can't handle it.,"My twin sister and I have had a horrible relationship for the last 23 years of our life. The kind of relationship that people said ""oh you'll get over when you're older"". Except I'm not over it. She physically and verbally abused me my entire life and continues to do so over trivial things now. 

When I was 18 I ended up moving 44 hours away from my family, but it was to get away from her. She's ruined most of my friendships and I just couldn't handle her anymore. After moving, her and I have been for the most part NC. When we do talk it's always for her to start a fight. Either making me feel bad for not coming home for a holiday, or just something. 

Most of my family understands our relationship but my mom, as she has for my entire life continues to be oblivious to it. ""Oh it's not that bad"" or ""All siblings fight"". She's the kind of  mom you see in those movies saying ""my baby would never do that"", as the child is getting hauled away for murder ... Yep that would be her.  I've been in therapy for the last 5 year to try and get over our relationship.

 But aside from the whole woe is me...

Two months ago I got engaged to the most amazing person. And as one would, I called my parents, then called my older sister and finally I called my twin. Hoping that she would be happy for me, or idk just something..... Welp, she was not. She told me how selfish I was for getting engaged to a man who lived so far away and how she already knows I'm never going to come back home. How selfish that is to my mother and went on like that until I hung up about 30 minutes later. She told me that I should be ashamed for asking guests and my family to come to my wedding so far away. Which I had already planned to offer at least half the cost of plane tickets. Even more for my family.. but whatever. 


This month we have begun to plan the first details of the wedding. The guest maximum for the ceremony would be 100 and I think that's even more than I was thinking originally. As I'm really just wanting it to be close friends and family. We were planning to invite more people to the reception (is that normal? I've never been to a wedding before), people with kids and friends that I'm not as close to. 

We have decided that at most each of us would have 4 bridesmaids/groomsmen. I'm still trying to figure out who will be it as well. However, already I know that the last person I want to be my MOH is my sister. I don't really even want her being in my bridal party. That decision has all but crushed my mother. She's really really upset about it. Calling me names and telling me how selfish I am for not being able to let go of our childhood. 

I hate to see her upset. However I know that having my sister in one of those roles will for sure lead to fights and I really don't want to be judged for every decision I make. 

Would it ruin my relationship with my sister forever if I don't have her in my wedding? I would like to have some sort of relationship one day. What can I do and how would I even tell her that she's not in the party without causing a fight

I sold the house to an investor. I offered my brother money to move out and a large chunk of money from the sale of the house (almost as much as he originally invested) if he was cooperative.  I haven't heard back from him about the offer.

He hasn't replied to my phone calls, texts or email.  So, I'm guessing he's pissed.  But, I believe I did the right thing, even though it was really difficult. I put myself first for once. Thank you for your advice!!!",relationship_advice
My tween daughter's birthday trip has gotten hijacked and I'd appreciate some outside perspective,"My tween daughter is part of a friends group. I, her mother, am friends with the mothers of her friends group. This can make tween drama pretty complicated. Anyways, she's had a hard year, so my husband and I told her that we'd take her to Universal for fall break (her birthday falls in the middle of it) and that she can bring a friend. She chose her Friend A, and I made sure A's parents had zero plans during fall break before extending the invitation. At first they said A could go, then that they'd also go since it's so far away... Now it has all changed. Now A and her younger sister B have invited a mutual friend of all of the girls and they are doing a Universal/Disney trip over Fall break. The whole point was for my daughter to have a friend ride down, stay with us on property, you know, the works. They'd bond, have fun, it was going to be great. Now I feel like she'd be a side attraction that would just meet up with the other group of 3 that will be staying with each other. I feel offended and feel that my friend, A's Mom, has hijacked what was supposed to be a special trip. 
Before I end this I want to say that I want to know if I'm just being ridiculous or not. While it might sound petty, this age is savage and girls can be unkind. There has been a lot of drama between the girls and I'm just worried about my daughter getting her feelings hurt. I'm not sure how to navigate this situation. Please give this Momma some advice.

Edited to add: we've already spent money, bought the extra Universal ticket, and my daughter was so excited that her and A were going. Now A's family is doing their own thing and A isn't coming with us anymore. My daughter feels like she's been cut out of her own plans. A's family made these plans out of thin air, which they can do as they please, but I feel that we were done wrong.",relationship_advice

Update:My grandmother who is illiterate and starting lose her mind signed a lease for a car she can't afford.,"Hello,

Here is a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/81lrvo/my_grandmother_who_is_illiterate_and_starting/

First off I would like to thank everyone for the advice they gave. It made me feel so much better knowing that there are great people out there willing to help.

On Saturday I contacted the dealership. They were no help and told me even if it was there grandmother there was nothing they could do. After the phone conversation I felt my next move was to go to the dealership with my grandmother.

At the dealership I spoke to the sales manager and the conversation didn't go well. I explained the situation to him and he said there was nothing he could do because they did everything legally. He said they could not discriminate based off of mental complicity. Then he went on to say that it was the same as him not being able to discriminate based off if someone was ""Black, Asian, etc.."". He then went on to compare it to them asking a woman to speak to her husband. At that point my younger cousin got upset and began speaking to him and he got annoyed then stated ""You are making me not want to help you"" and that ""If this is the case where were you when she was here"". I told him that we needed to step outside to continue this conversation. Outside of the room I explained that what he said came off extremely disrespectful and that the dealership came and picked her up so how would I know this was happening. A few minutes later I realized speaking to this guy was a waste of our time.

I did find out on the bank paper work it said $3,000 ssi a month which is way off. I confronted him about the number and he said my grandmother confirmed it. I asked her in front of him how much she makes and she had no idea. I asked if he verified her income and he said he did not need to. After I left the dealership I had a friend of mine who sells cars look at the paper work and he discovered they had her sign up for a $1700 service agreement even though the terms of the lease would have that car covered through the car manufacturers warranty. He informed me that it seemed they padded the lease as much as possible and that I should inform the bank that she can't afford the lease because it is almost 50% of her fixed income.

I called the bank which is through that car manufacturer and explained the entire situation. The lady on the phone asked me if I was trying to break the lease early. I explained I was just trying to get the lease nullified due to unethical business practice and the fact she not afford it. She transferred me over to customer care and I explained the entire thing there as well. The lady was helpful and escalated the issue to the regional customer service person. She said they would call me the next day (Tuesday).

I recieved a call on Tuesday but missed it due to being in a work meeting. I called the guy back 3 times yesterday and left messages. I also called him this morning and have not heard back. I then called her county APS office and explained the situation. They said they could not help and that I should seek out legal help.

Currently I am waiting to back from the customer service manager and trying to find a lawyer who deals with these situations.

No Sex Tonight!,"I've never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much.

And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.

For example… One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""

I said ""WHAT??!! What was that?!""

So she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...""You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?""

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey.""

She appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, ""I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.""

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No honey, I don't feel like it.""

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?""

I then said ""Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.

You're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?""

Apparently, no sex tonight either!

TIFU by getting frustrated with a toddler.,"This happened a few hours ago and I'm still dealing with the aftermath.

Typically, I'm a morning person, but I couldn't sleep last night due to stress from work, etc, so I took a few unisom to help me doze off. Fine, nothing out of the ordinary. I wake up this morning, feeling like the grouchiest asshole this side of the Atlantic. My wife and 10yo daughter are fighting about some dumb thing or another, which is an all day/every day thing as of late. All I want to do is make a cup of tea and smoke a cigarette, but everybody seems hellbent on getting in my way and stressing me out first thing in the morning. The screaming match wakes up my 2yo son, adding to the stress. He starts crying. The water in the kettle starts boiling. I'm pissed off because not  only did I wake up to a mild approximation of the Battle of Normandy after getting very little actual sleep, but we're out of tea, my mug is missing, the unisom hadn't fully worn off (that stuff makes me extremely irritable), and to top it off, I can smell shit. I was ready to flip the fuck out.

The Fuck Up:

I ask my wife if she'd mind cutting out the screaming match and just take our daughter to school, and pick up a box of Tips on the way back, but she ignores me. My daughter bolts out the front door like a horse in a thunderstorm. My son had stopped crying, but absolutely did not want to have his diaper changed. He starts running away, laughing, having a blast. I finally catch him, but getting him to lie still was all but impossible. When I finally manage to get him onto the changing mat, he starts kicking me repeatedly in the face and chest. I lose it, hold down his little legs, undo the velcro-ish straps, and...fling the shitty diaper as hard as I could across the room. It took a moment for my sleep-deprived mind to realize what I've done, and when it finally catches up, I turn around and see an arc of shit across the ceiling  (a *popcorn* ceiling, no less), ending in a Jackson Pollock of shit all over the wall and my TV. To top it off, by the time I turned back around, the poopy-butt toddler is gone. I find him sitting in his brand new car seat, eating peanut butter with his bare hands.

I ended up calling out, so I could clean up the *SHIT* and not go to prison for murdering someone at work.

Tl;dr: Couldn't sleep, took sleeping pills that make me irritable, woke up to utter chaos, lost my temper while trying to change a diaper, flung a shitty diaper across the room resulting in a disgusting modern art masterpiece across the ceiling and wall.",tifu

TIFU by leaving my ear tubes in for 13 years and not realizing my hearing was going to be different when I took them out,"Happened this week and I just read another user's post about breathing through one nostril and I felt inspired to share my own story.

Context: I've had tubes in my ears my whole life, 24 of my 25 years. My childhood is filled with eat eat infections, vaccuums, drops, 6 nurses holding me down as I fought them off, and surgery. I've had 5 to 8 sets of tubes in my ears. My mom and I honestly lost count because there were just too many. My last tube set was put in when I was in 5th grade I believe. I was around 10 or 11. 

I've lived my entire life with them and they've never caused problems. In fact they've helped a few times! I feel absolutely no pressure in my ears on airplanes because the tubes equalize pressure slowing me to be fine. It's awesome. 

So here's where the issues started. 4 months ago I started waking up to watery ears, which for me is a really bad sign. I ignored it because at this point in my life ENT doctors give me a lot of anxiety. But the symptoms started getting worse so last month I bit the bullet and went in. I saw the same doctor I had seen and a child. I couldn't believe he was still alive! He told me I developed a polyp on my tube and it's been in there so long he wants to remove it. I knew this day would come so I agreed.

My surgery was last Thursday and immediately post OP I realized things were off. My ear popped more times than I could count and I realize I feel air pressure now - no more carefree plane rides. My hearing was incredibly sensitive as well. Usually I blast my damn music in my car but now I drive around at 6 volume. And finally my voice has changed. The way I sound to myself it's completely different to what I've come to know over the course of my life. I can't really tell if I'm whispering or shouting just yet because I've never heard this voice before and it's going to take some getting used to. The kicker is that the doctor only removed my right tube, so now my hearing feels...uneven. I guess having something in my ear canal for 24 years effected my hearing -  who would have guessed?! I genuinely did not. 

PARENTS: please remove your child's ear tubes before they reach adulthood. 

Edit: Thank you for the gold! Thank you so much for the Platinum!!! Thank you for the silver!!!

My gf is dirty as hell and I can't stand it,"So my gf (22f) is one of my biggest blessings in life, but man is this girl dirty as hell. When we first initially met she had told me, but I was like naw can't be that bad... boy was I wrong. 

Just a little back story... we have been together for about a year and live together. Let's talk dirty:

The kitchen - she loves to cook, but does not clean as she goes. Dishes will pile up. Trash gets full. Unless I clean the kitchen which is basically every day bc I can't stand the mess it will stay dirty. I have talked to her before about how I shouldn't have to clean every single day, but she just doesn't get it. 

Laundry - she will pile that shit up and let it pile forever. She be questioning whether garments are clean or dirty. Half the time I do her laundry and I have to ask her to fold it. If I don't, she will just add the clean clothes to another basket. 

Room- when she gets home from work she just takes her clothes off throughout the room when she could have just put it in the dirty laundry to begin with. She will bring food into the room and leave dirty plates and cups for DAYS. Things start to cultivate! 

Honestly, I have talked to her about cleanliness and how important it is, but she doesn't get it. I explained that we are now living together and we need to come to some sort of middle grounds. Whenever I bring it up she gets annoyed. She will clean the day after I mention it and then never do it again until I bring it up AGAIN. Ugh. Advice, suggestions?


EDIT: WOW this really blew up! I just wanted a little advice so that I could hear different perspectives. Some of you provided great advice so I appreciate that! Will definitely be talking to her to see what can work best for both of us.",relationship_advice

He has been working for a company for well over ten years. This is a large commercial real estate company and he manages a local property for them. He has been there over 10 years, and for the first few there were plans to develop the property into a large commercial shopping center. Those plans fell through and now the property owner is trying to attract an even larger client for the entire property. 

However this attraction process is taking its dear sweet time. They keep telling him ""six more months, six more months..."" - that was about three years ago. Now the day to day drudgery is catching up to him and he's not happy. He recently interviewed for a position that would pay him almost triple his salary and would reinvigorate his love for his career.

TIFU by not staying in touch with my friends,"Obligatory this happened many years ago, but I just realized it is a good story to tell here. Also, throwaway account since I still cringe thinking about it.

One of my friends (we'll call him Carl) invited me to a party at his house. We used to hang out a lot, but for no apparent reason we lost touch for a while so I was excited to get a chance to catch up with him. When I got to the party, it was packed. Tons of people, most of whom I'd never met before, but I knew a few and naturally gravitated towards them. I also ran into Carl, but we only spoke briefly before he had to move on to mingling with other guests. After about an hour, I ran into a woman who I knew in college (who we'll call Karen), but hadn't seen her since, so it was interesting to try to figure out who she had a connection with at the party. Since it seemed rude to just outright ask ""What are you doing here?"", I tried to ease into my investigation, but didn't get very far because she was quickly called away to something else. Then after little while longer, Carl gets everyone's attention for what looked like a toast and I noticed that for some reason he had just put his arm around Karen.

At this point, I should probably explain that while I am not very good at socializing with complete strangers, I do seem to have a pretty quick wit at times, especially when it comes to retelling jokes from comedy shows and movies at the perfect time. So, [the proposal scene in Big Daddy](https://youtu.be/vWyPfvAbUOQ) immediately popped into my head. If you don't know the scene, then I'd recommend that you click the link. But, if you just want the text-only version, Kevin (Jon Stewart's character) is about to propose to Corinne (Leslie Mann's character) in front of a group of friends and Kevin naturally hesitates a bit to get the words out. Sonny (Adam Sandler's character) doesn't think that Corinne and Kevin are compatible so, to protect Kevin, the following dialogue takes place:

Sonny: ""You're not proposing, are you?!?"" 

Kevin: ""Uhh, yeah, pal. I am.""

Sonny: ""Well... think about it, you know?""

Corinne: ""God, Sonny, shut up!""

I thought that repeating this scene would be perfectly hilarious since these two are just friends anyway, so bomb's away. I yell out from the back of the room ""You're not proposing are you?!?"" and waited for the laughter to ensue. To my disappointment, other than a few chuckles from some people (mostly people who knew me), I was met with silence and a pretty dirty look from Karen. That's when it hit me like a ton of bricks. Oh my goodness, Carl actually is proposing to Karen. I didn't even know they were good friends, let alone dating. Out of sheer panic and my inexplicable urge to immediately ease the tension, I double-down and yell out ""Well... think about it, you know?"". Again, mostly silence and Karen was now throwing daggers at me with her eyes. Carl continued on with the proposal, which actually turned out to be a proposal announcement. The actual proposal already happened and Karen already said ""Yes"", but this was the first time that everyone was finding out about it, so I'm pretty sure I still ruined the experience for a lot of people.

Afterwards, I apologized to both of them profusely trying to explain that I didn't know that they were even dating. Carl said he thought it was hilarious and was cool about it, but even now I'm pretty sure it will still be quite a while before Karen forgives me, if ever. I still cringe whenever I think about it.

TL;DR Went to a party and my friend (host) starting making a toast. I thought I would be funny by re-enacting the proposal scene in Big Daddy and sarcastically asking him to reconsider his ""engagement"" to his friend standing next to him. Turns out that they were both actually dating and actually announcing their engagement.

EDIT: For those saying ""Why choose such an obscure movie reference?"" At the time, Adam Sandler movies had really just started its trend of declining popularity. So, some people appreciated the reference, but obviously not as many people as I thought. Hindsight is 20/20 and this is really the whole reason why I posted this.

I am his girlfriend and tonight he met with me to tell me how much of a gold digger I am and gave me the link to this Reddit you all have been talking about me on and said ""That's what everyone thinks of you"". I wish I could describe the pain this has caused me. We only partially discussed finances, and we only see each other about twice a week. We hardly go on any dates, the other night we had top ramen and watched Netflix movies in his room and I was very happy. I make my own money, I pay my own tuition out of pocket, going to have a great career and I consider myself very self sufficient. I am very proud of him for being able to finance (not own) a house. I asked if he would keep it if we were together and married and he said ""yes"". I asked if he would rent it out to offset the expenses of another mortgage we could share 50/50 on together and he became very defensive saying I was trying to make money off his childhood home. I never tried to offend him, and only asked bc I saw a marriage as more of a unison type thing. I already said I would get a prenup with him, so I'm also not sure why he is bringing this up. 

In conclusion, there are always two sides of every story. I am not a monster or a gold digger. We go on very cheap dates  every few weeks ($10-$30) and I've thanked him every time he would offer to pay. I have paid for some. I just wanted to give my say in this. We are no longer together as of tonight. I sincerely appreciate everyone who took the time to give an opinion stating that there may be more to the story than he is willing to share. I hope I have a partner who loves me enough to give me the benefit of the doubt, and talk to me in a more positive light. ",relationship_advice
My (14f) girlfriend is being abused by her father and i really need help.,"I'm using a throwaway account for obvious reasons
Reasons and I do have her permission to post this.

I'm (15m) and I met my girlfriend 3 months ago, she has aspergers and is an incredibly sweet and amazing girl.

We met at a theatre group and when we finally admitted our feelings for eachother everything seemed fine, except for her over apologizing for everything.

When we met up for the first time outside the group we had talked on the phone for a while and she had said her dad was a bit harsh but I really had no idea how ""harsh"" that meant.

She told me her dad hit her and that was the first point that I got worried, I asked her if she ever thought about doing something about it and she told me not to worry.

Over our calls she tells me how she's made to feel shameful about basic things about growing up, being human and on top of that, emotionally abused to the point that she didn't feel human.

She also has multiple self harm scars from that time, but has currently stopped cutting herself.

At school she only has one friend who seems to a terrible friend and very manipulative/mean to her.

She's told me that essentially I'm the only one in her life that's genuinely nice to her.

She is worked to the bone because after 5 days of school she also has to attend a polish school and then have the theatre group leaving her with no days off at all.

It was at this point I became extremely worried.

Her family tells her she's fat when she's quite obviosily and in no uncertain terms, skinny.
I'm worried she could also develop body issues.

Here's where it gets bad though.
Today after having a lovely day together chilling and watching movies we lost track of time.

she was supposed to be home by 9pm and my mom thought that her parents were picking her up while we thought that my mom was taking us back so we thought that my mom would call us to go.
This didn't happen and by the time we realized it was already 9:02pm.

She called her parents and got picked up and I thought all was fine.

Obviously it wasn't.
She called me when she got home with tears in her eyes saying that we weren't allowed to see eachother anymore.

Later she texted me secretly telling me her dad screamed at her the whole way home and called her whore, slut, idiot, etc etc etc...
She then revealed that her whole family was told that she was a whore by her dad.

I finally ""snap"" at this point and suggest getting CPS (child protective services) involved.
She's hesitant as she has a hard time in new situations and is naturally nervous about possibly getting taken away.

I make the argument that either stay in the abusive home and possibly be further mentally scarred or be brave and take a chance for a better life.

She agrees and I ask her if there is anything else that her family has done to her for me to write up about to make a case.

The next part is so despicable that I don't recommend those who are easily saddened or disturb read further.

She tells me that her dad, when she was younger punched her in very sensitive spots, including her vagina.
And also that he ""accidentally"" walks in when she's dressing.
He gets physically close to her.
and undresses in her presence sometimes.

Also she told me that one time when she was self harming her dad caught her, and threw her across the room and mocked her.

When she cries she tells me she's also mocked by her dad.

She tells me that her mom and dad will hurt her if we stay together.

This is all I can remember.
Sorry for the grammar mistakes I wrote this in a hurry and in a rage.

As a moral person I cannot allow this to happen to someone I care about.

Please I need advice and if you can share this.

I'm deeply scared for her.

She told me that she's worried tonight her dad will hurt her while she sleeps.


Edit: I've given her the number of the childline and she says she will call it.
I've told her to find a place where she won't be heard so she's safe.

Edit 2: I've told my mom and I'm  following her advice.
I can't do much more tonight as my girlfriend's gone to bed

Edit 3: to all the people suggesting talking to a school counselor i'm homeschooled so I have no way of contacting the counselor.

My favorite joke: Everyone Knows Dave,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Jokes

&#x200B;

The same thing happened a second time the day after I posted that, so I went along with the suggestion of filming myself while I sleep, and did that starting just over a week ago whenever I napped during the day/evening.

&#x200B;

Long story short it clearly is my brother, I've got him doing it on film twice and thats without even filming myself at night. I have no idea how to even start to talk to him about this, or if I should just stay quiet and try to sleep less until we're back to separate bedrooms.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didnt expect so much advice! I'm going to read everything. And for those asking, my brother's a year younger than me. So I'm quite worried about having the video at all for the reasons some people pointed out.

&#x200B;

2nd Edit: I want to thank everyone for giving advice, even if a lot of people seem to be arguing about what's best and how serious it is etc. Some very calm sounding people have suggested I speak to my brother before anything else, so I'm going to do that. I know some others have warned not to do this, but I think its important to speak to him first. If it goes badly with him then I can still speak to my parents or someone else, but if I speak to them first I can't undo it.

I'm still getting comments and private messages asking a lot of the same stuff, so - I'm 14, he's 13. As for why I 'let him do it a second time', well I do still have to sleep, and I kept recording myself until I made this post and people pointed out why it might be such a bad idea.

Porn has ruined an entire generation's sexuality and needs to be prohibited,"I really feel that porn has irrevocably ruined an entire generation's sexuality, especially young men under 30. 30 years prior, porn was pictures of women lightly clothed in Playboy Magazines. Porn today?

It's all about

- choking women

- ramming a dick into women's vaginas as hard as possible

- dominating women and giving a false impression of women wanting to be dominated and submissive all the time

- promotion of incest porn and violent porn

- promotion of ""girl and daddy"" porn that freakishly resemble sexual acts between under age women and older men

- women being covered in jizz, now seen as a ""normal"" sex act and something women should be tolerant of or they're seen as prudes

- men believing anal sex is to be expected and women who don't conform to it are prudes

- women having their vaginal lips surgically removed and somehow seen as the ""the normal"" vagina to the extent that more and more young women go through with such surgery

- women having their vaginas totally shaven, a new concept that has impacted how men and women view female sexuality

- porn upholds the misogynist thought that women exist only to pleasure men, and that their sexuality and pleasure don't matter

- porn upholds the misogynist thought that all women find sexual acts common in porn as something enjoyable, which makes men believe they don't have to ask or be informed about what women find arousing and pleasurable


And so much more. Honestly porn is one of the great public health crisis of our time and needs to be treated at such. If you enter pornhub or any random pornsite, it's flooded by extreme porn like incestporn or violent porn that includes some kind of slapping, beating, choking of women and people act surprised that men think this is what all women wants in reality. 

Since parents don't want to talk to their children about how harmful porn is (most find it embarrassing), this cannot be resolved with education. Many parents are ignorant of how huge the problem is and some don't want to adress it. The porn crisis can only be solved by prohibiting it, and minimizing it's influence on young men and women.

This thread will now be downvoted or flooded with men who can't accept the realities of porn and how harmful it is to society because they've been brainwashed by all the porn they've been viewing daily since they were 10. They don't care about the well being of women, what matters is getting of and getting of is more important than prohibiting harmful stereotypes that upholds institutional misogyny in society.

Edit: Just to clarify. I'm not a prude or sex negative. People are free to do engage in whatever consensual sex act they find pleasurable. I'm critical of the normalisation of extreme porn. Some women do enjoy having their vaginas rammed, jizz in their face, being submissive etc. Notice ""some women"". Todays porn gives out the message that ALL women like these acts and that ALL women should be treated like this by default. Young people aren't emotionally and neurologically developed to understand the nuances of sexuality, which todays porn is missrepresenting.

We just returned home from our vacation, and the last two days were hell on my imagination. I know I said in the last post that I wasn't going to do anything about it, but I found that I couldn't just sit there and pretend everything was alright. 

So I spoke to my brother.

We were alone, though our mother was in the house. It filled with lots of crying. He basically confessed to having those fantasies, but said that he would never hurt me in real life. I only read one of the stories, and apparently many of his other works also included me. I told him that he already did and he promised to stop publishing new ones and to get rid of/change the old ones. 

He asked that I not tell anyone about it (would ruin his life, he said) and in exchange agreed that he was going to get therapy when we both return to our colleges in the fall. Sounded fair, so I agreed, and we ended the convo with a hug at his request. 

In a sense, it felt like a really weird break up. Not sure how to better describe it. We most definitely will not be able to have what we used to have in the past, and I hope any awkwardness at future family events can be overcome by time/distance and a butt load of therapy. I'm glad it was sorted out, although that convo was definitely one of the most awkward ones I ever had.

Update My wife is going to gave sex with other men,"Sorry I posted this update in the wrong sub. Here we go. My wife and I calmed down on Sunday to discuss this mess. I had been avoiding her all week until I could get my head around it. We took a drive in the car, something we like to do for like 3 hours. My wife started out apologizing for how she presented this to me. She had been rehearsing on what to say. When it came time to inform me it just spilled out of her mouth all wrong. She wanted to bring up now that kids are grown and on their own, she would like us to make changes in our lives. She went on about not having other sexual partners etc. What she wanted to propose was that we have an open relationship, where we both would seek out others. 

I told her that I would not , could not do this. I reminded her of the vows before God, family and friends we took on fidelity. I told her how she had violated the trust that I had for her. Look I understand what she is feeling. I know she wants new experiences. I told her our plan as we had discussed many times in the past, once the kids were out that we would travel a bit. Maybe take up new hobbies, maybe some education classes etc. We never had a discussion about this. 

I told her because of the breach of trust and her steadfastly stating she is going to do this I was seeing a lawyer Tuesday to start divorce proceedings. At this point if she said she would not go thru with this I do not think I could not think she could be cheating at some point. That is where the trust comes in. I think divorce is proper, she can do her thing no guilt can be associated. I think equal division of assests, I expect to make no support payments, did not know if it was a thing in our state, its not. We will have to sell the house and each downsize. We actually had a good talk. Papers are being drawn. We hope  to get through this by fall.

I did talk to each kid individually, explained we are going seperate ways. Did not mention the lifestyle change. They can talk to their mom themselves. I will always love my wife. I will take the high road. I know many of you wanted scortched earth but I can not do that, its not me. I do want to address a couple comments someone posted on the update on the other sub.

AITA for telling my parents they won't be invited to my wedding?.,"My fiance and I have been dealing with a conflict with my parents for just over a year now. 


My fiance is on the Autism Spectrum, so sometimes has difficulty with social etiquette, relationships, body language etc. 

My family has been aware of this for years, even before we started dating. 

They take a lot of issue with him, even back when we were in high school. Him and my dad argued about the name of a restaurant and my dad called him an arrogant asshole for insisting he was wrong. 

More recently, an incident occurs where my fiance tries to have a discussion with my parents about a book that his mom (who is a parenting author) just released. My dad felt offended by this and thought that my fiance meant they were no good at parenting. He went on to yell at the both of us, swearing and calling my fiance names including ""retard"" (which he took offense to given his diagnosis. My father knows this)

They both sort of didn't address it again but we asked for an apology. We did not receive it. Rather, we got several texts that were aggressive in nature from my dad, and guilt-trippy messages from my mom to just move on from it. 

A few weeks ago, my sister made a post on social media holding her friend's baby. My fiance commented jokingly ""Is it yours"". Now, I know it was a joke and sometimes he doesn't understand that jokes can have ""wrong"" audiences and jokes can be badly timed. My parents didn't give him that grace and sent us messages about how his behaviour seems to be reckless and potentially dangerous and the comment was shameful. My mom's message said they did not give their blessing for my engagement. My father's text said the same thing but also included ""Are you really trying to tell me that boy/man with all his mental deficiencies is really good for your life??? That's a tough sell my dear."" 

I chose not to respond because I felt like it was aggressive.

Today I sent a message to my mother to convey my thoughts and make some things clear to her. In it I said that if they didn't give their blessing, they shouldn't expect an invitation to our wedding. 

In some ways I feel unsure about this. My sister recently told me that I'm being disrespectful to them and I should be grateful that they gave me a great life.

I know the whole saying ""family is family"" but I can't help but wonder, where's the line? When is it ok to say NO, you won't put up with it anymore?

LPT: Need something done? Call legal,"TL/DR: Can't get a corporation to do their job? Call their legal department and ask/tell them about their liability.

Story: The cable/internet provider's underground junction box on my corner had a broken latch, making the cover not sit correctly on the box. It's a big junction box, about 2'x4', and the kids who gather at the bus stop there were always playing with it and leaving it ajar. I wanted it fixed because (a) didn't want some kid getting hurt, and (b) eventually something would break and I'd lose my internet.

I called the customer service line several times and nothing got done.

So I called the corporate main number and asked for legal. Person asked how to direct my call and I told them I wanted to ask someone about their liability for injuries caused by their equipment.  Got a lawyer on the phone and told them about the situation, and that I was sure they would want to fix it ASAP because ""if a child gets hurt there I'm sure you don't want that liability falling on you."" Made sure to ask for their name, title, email address, and direct phone line and to mention that I would email my notes from our conversation to them, and would welcome any comments/corrections if I missed anything.

TIFU By Ejaculating a Huge Load of Blood Directly into my Wife's Mouth,"This literally happened tonight. 

&#x200B;

So, last Monday, I got a vasectomy (my wife and I came to the conclusion that there are already more than enough people in the world). Per doctor's orders, I wasn't able to ejaculate for the first week. 

  
Fast forward to today, and it's been six full days. I'm now hornier than an incel walking past a Victoria's Secret . The wife and I decide to give it a try in the bedroom. After an attempt at traditional intercourse proves to be short lived because my nether buddies are still too sore, my wife comes up clutch. I take a quick shower and we quickly go at it again. This time, she goes down on me. Normally, I have a hard time cumming from just a blow job, but I was so pent up that I erupt after about 2 minutes. My wife, being the superstar that she is, initially takes it like a champ. Then, after time seems to stand still for a moment, she spews out huge glob after huge glob of a blood red semen concoction onto my stomach. I look at it in abject horror for a second, and then say aloud, ""oh yeah, I read that could happen"". Wife is briefly exasperated, ""you couldn't have remembered that a minute ago"", but ends up taking the whole thing magnanimously.

&#x200B;

Fortunately, this fuck up didn't have any serious consequences, other than the emotional trauma associated with seeing your wife spit out your bloody semen. 

&#x200B;

TLDR - Had a vascectomy last week, got a BJ from the wife today, and shot a bloody mess into her mouth tonight.  

Edit - Thanks for the silver! Also, the number of of comments implying my wife's bf will buy me a Switch makes me feel like a chump for spending my own money on one. Incels are weird.

I (20f) Checked My BF's (29m) Phone And May Have Ruined Our Relationship,"He was on his computer playing a game and his notifications were going off like crazy.  It was like 3am. There's this one girl from his work that texts him sometimes and she's really pretty, I saw it was from her and got a bad feeling so I checked his phone. It was stupid but he works late with her sometimes and said she told him she was interested in him once, when I see her I always wonder why he's still with me. 
  
So I started reading and it was all pretty innocent but he seemed really close to her and I got kinda sad and got sucked into it guess. When I looked up again he was turned around looking at me in his chair.  
  
I'd asked him early on if we could exchange phone passwords and he said no because he valued his privacy, so I definitely broke his trust and I know that was stupid and wrong. 
  
He asked if I found what I was looking for. I couldn't really say anything, I just kinda sat there looking at him and waiting for him to yell at me. (He's never yelled at me, but my family does and it just felt like he should.) He asked me if there was anything else I wanted to look at while I had his phone and I shook my head no. Then he came over and kissed me on the forehead, and said he'd take me home.  
  
I cried the entire way back and he didn't say a word. He walked me to my door and patted my head and left. I've texted him a few times today but he hasn't answered. 
  
I couldn't go to work today, I've just been in ther corner if my room curled up watching YouTube videos and crying. He won't talk to me at all, I don't know how mad he is or what he's thinking and feel sick. We were talking about getting married. How do I get him to communicate with me again so I can apologize?

Aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why I have missing fingers?,"I have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. It's fine. I can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days I can't, that's the dyspraxia). However, I won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. I only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

I'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but I still find it annoying. I really don't get why you'd think it would be an OK thing to ask someone about, but hey. I wasn't raised in a barn. Usually I nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

Anyway, I started a new job about a month ago, and I honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. I felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and I decided to make myself laugh. When the first new coworker asked about it, I completely lied and told her that I chewed them off as a baby. I then decided to tell the next person who asked that I cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that I was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. All genuinely ridiculous reasons but I'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. I didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. Maybe they just thought there's no way I'd lie about how I lost my fingers.

Within about 3 days, I learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. I'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3D printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

Anyway, I told this story to my brother today and he told me that I was an asshole because I caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. My argument is that I'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because I didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, I was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think I actually severed three fingers with dental floss when I was 3. I'll accept my judgement, though.

Update: gonna check out here, I think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity.

There needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before I even begin to give a shit about Fat acceptance for women.,"Perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but I'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but I talk to gay men a lot. (I've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

I don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. How emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. My size isn't great either but I've come to accept it, however, I know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

When I see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, I laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. A man can't. A woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. Why should I focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

The rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. Many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. While it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

Edit: as an addendum, I'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

All I can say is fuck most of you. You treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. Thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. It was luck of the God damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. While the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. Even though I accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) I know I could have it a lot worse and many men do. I still have it in the back of my mind that whoever I'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. I'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**Edit 2: I would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

I didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. I'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

Firstly I'd like to address this ludicrous notion that I hate women. I dont know how I can prove to any of you that I dont hate women other than me saying I dont. I may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. My problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

I understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. No one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. My main point was I believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **I never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) I simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. I get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. But from where I'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. Perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case I apologize and acknowledge my fault. And before anyone addresses it, I'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. That was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and I used penis size as an example. What I really want is inclusivity. Of everyone. 

Another topic I'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" While I understand the logic, I dont really see how its productive. Sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. Many of us crave it, strive for it. Make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. When a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. If left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. I understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. But I feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. Which is why I'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. But I feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. And I agree with that, but all I'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

I obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but I believe I'm a bit of an idealist. For better or worse, I sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. Whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

Another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. Many thought I was an asshole in my post and I would agree with that. I admit I'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why I dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. Many suggested that I should start the movement myself, but I'm simply not the right person for the job. I'm hot headed, I sometimes don't think before I speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. I'm a private person, despite how I am online with anonymity, in real life I am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. I also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. I see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" I knew there would be opposition to this post and I was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. Perhaps rightly so, because I'm a bit of a dick. But love me or hate me, I stand by most of what I said. 

I sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. Supporting one particular group. (Culturally speaking I'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) I care about people despite what many of you may believe. And all I really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (Aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

The last major point I'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. Somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. I'll admit that sure, I wish I had a bigger dick. I feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part I can tolerate it. I've had partners who didn't care and I genuinely believe them. I know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. So you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

One last thing is I really do appreciate the discussion. There are a lot of points I strongly disagree with that I didn't address here, and there are many ideas I really should think over and reevaluate myself. And I thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",unpopularopinion

TIFU by jokingly insulting my 7-year-old kid in front of their teacher,"Obligatory didn't happen today, but last week.

People who know me say I'm a gentle soul, but that I have an ""angry listening face"", don't do small talk and can be quite opinionated, so I tend to avoid other people at my children's school, because interactions usually don't go well...

So last week Thursday, I arrived at school to pick up my kids and went to the store right next-door to buy some groceries. School is in English and we speak French at home, which means we can usually say whatever we want without anyone eavesdropping. While waiting in line, I turned to my daughter and went ""You're ugly"", to which she replied ""thank you"".

Now, you need to know the back story... There is this French black comedy called ""Tatie Danielle"" which features an angry, old lady insulting and abusing everyone. In one of the scenes she tells a mother ""Your girl is nice, but damn, she's so ugly"". This sort of became a running joke in our family and I feel this also teaches my kids not to take insults at face value. We sometimes throw out quotes from the movie, mimicking an old lady voice.

Of course, I did not know that the only teacher in the school who understands French was behind me... and this of course is my daughter's teacher. She was shocked and let out a small gasp.

I turned around and she told my angry listening face ""Your daughter is not ugly"". She then started talking to my daughter: Is your father tough at home with you? Is he mean to you? What about your mother, is she tough with you?

Without missing a beat, my daughter went: Nope, they are both very cool.

To this day, this teacher still looks at me suspiciously.

TL;DR: I jokingly told my daughter she was ugly. She said thank you. All this while her teacher was standing behind me, who now thinks I abuse my kids.",tifu

AITA for getting a tattoo before my brother's wedding?,"My brother is getting married in a few months. I have been asked to be in the wedding party. 

I'm in my early 30s and have been getting tattooed once every year or two since I was 20, so by now I have a number of tattoos, they're all well-done and no offensive/shocking designs. Mostly they are nature and abstract art. No one in my family really likes my tattoos, but it's not their body or their money so their comments never bothered me much.

Sometimes good tattoo artists have LONG waiting lists. There's an artist I've been trying to get an appointment with for years and recently his receptionist contacted me saying they had appointments available. I booked one and got a new piece a few weeks ago. It never occurred to me to think of the wedding before getting it done, and besides, I already have so many tattoos that why would one more make any difference? 

But my brother saw the tattoo in one of my social media photos and contacted me upset that my new tattoo will be a distraction during the wedding and in the pictures. The dress that he and the bride picked for the wedding party is short and strapless. I offered to wear a different outfit that covers more skin, but they also think it would be distracting for me to not match the rest of the party. 

I asked why my older tattoos didn't bother them but the new one did, and they said it's because they ""had to accept"" the old ones and thought I'd ""respect them"" by not getting any more. I don't really understand how it has to do with respect. 

AITA for not thinking of the wedding pictures before booking my tattoo? I'm married, I get that wedding photos are expensive and you want them to look good, but I don't think it's right to dictate your wedding partys appearances other than choosing their clothes.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by being young and dumb I guess,"*I was 16 when this happened. Golden age of fuck ups.* 

I hooked up with one of the girls from my church. We were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. I was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the Big G. However the two of us shared one common goal. We wanted to fuck. Which we did. But afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her ""carnal sins"". She named and shamed both of us. None of this would've been *that* bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father.

School has suspended my 3rd grader for saying the word 'gun'. - NY,"Yesterday I got a call from my 8 year old son's school, saying i had to immediately pick him up, but they did not say why. I rushed out of work to get him, and when I got to the school the vice principal had him in the office. I was told that my son was being suspended for a week, and would be mandated to see a social worker twice a week. When I asked what was going on, I was told that my son made threatening statements to another student during indoor recess, and it was overheard by the recess monitor and reported. My son was looking really upset at all this, but the vice principal said it was the rules and there was nothing that could be done. I then turned to my son and asked him what he said, and he told me he was flexing his arm muscles in the gym and said 'Look at these guns!'.   


 Apparently 'gun' is a trigger word that all staff have to report, no matter what the context, and an investigation has to occur before the student is allowed to return. The vice principal reiterated that it could be construed as a threatening statement and that school policy was that he would need to see a social worker twice a week during his recess period.

I am beyond pissed off at this. What exactly can I do? I now will have to take time off of work for three days next week, and  probably the full week after since they told me they won't be able to do the investigation thanksgiving week. ",legaladvice

2. Ex being arrested for violating the temporary restraining order and being jailed for a day.
3. Getting the permanent restraining order
4. Being arrested for violating the permanent restraining order for a month and being released on probation. Probation conditions explicitly state he is to not contact my sister or be within her vicinity.

Despite being on probation, he's playing ding dong ditch at random times during the late night for the past week. We have video evidence of him being here through our Ring doorbell. We've called the cops multiple times and they take a while to get here and by that time they can't find him (or they don't try too hard).

Her ex is homeless, living in his car (probably), and disowned by his parents so we don't really have a clue where he is during the day.

It was easier to get him arrested the first couple times because he actually stuck around for someone to open the door, but now he's given up on that completely and he does not seem in his right mind anymore. Last time I spoke with him, he claimed to be hearing voices and we've heard him talking to himself a couple times on the Ring videos. He's not doing anything violent, but you never know, he could snap and do something crazy one day.

My sister spoke to his probation officer and told her the situation. He's currently scheduled to appear to court next month to address his probation violation.

I'm not sure if there's anything else we *can* do about this situation other than keep calling the cops and hope he attends his hearing next month. Anything else that could possibly help us?

I [22F] found out that my boyfriend [26M] of eight months is secretly a massive creep," 

Because I recently discovered his reddit account and his post history on here is extremely worrying to me. On a post with a gif of a young teen girl doing an acrobatic exercise he commented how she was a ""beautiful, cute nymphet"" and then proceeded to argue with another user about how it was ""perfectly natural to be attracted to girls that age"". On a post in a porn subreddit one user said how the girl ""looked 13"" and he replied something along the lines of ""I know, right? So hot. Wish more adult women had her built."" And more, comments about how he thinks young teen girls are hot.

&#x200B;

I don't know what the right term is and I don't really care, for me being attracted to girls that age is definitely pedo territory and it makes him a massive creep in my opinion. Now I don't want to stay with him any longer, obviously I'll break up with him, should I just do so without telling him the reason or should I tell him that I'm disgusted that he's such a creep and is trying to justify his sick desires online? Another thing I've wondered about is whether I should let others know. He doesn't work with children or teenagers but for instance he has friends who have younger sisters around that age and maybe he's not the kind of person they'd like to keep around.

TIFU by watching porn on a hot day,"This happened a few hours ago

So a little backstory: I live with a flatmate who is never home, I had a day off from classes and decided to 'treat my self' with a nice hot steaming bath.

So, it was a hot day today and I decided to take a bath. I ALWAYS take a shower so I had no idea how to set the bath's temperature correctly, I accidently got it to be a little too warm. 

I decide to treat myself even further with a plate of nachos, guacamole and my laptop on a table high enough for me to reach as I'm in the bath. I take my clothes off, step in and realize it a little too warm for my comfort but it ain't no biggy, I lay down and 'relax' but my horny teenager hormones hit me all of a sudden. I. HAVE. TO. WATCH. PORN. 

I get on my laptop, turn from watching an episode of parks and rec into brazzers, put on a 3 hour porn video and begin beating my meat. For some reason it suddenly starts getting too hot, my forehead is full of sweat and my heart is pounding, I feel like I wanna pass out.

I beat my meat furiously at this point, my heart rate increasing with every stroke, it feels like I'm gonna have a Heartattack and just as soon as I orgasm, I pass out. 

A few minutes later I'm awoken up by the sound of my flatmate breaking the door of the toilet and the unmistakable sound of a woman being pounded into oblivion, her moans loud and clear as day. My flatmate got home early today with his friend from work who I never met, they broke in because they needed the toilet and I never opened it for them. 

I'm still in my bedroom hiding until this embarrassing event is forgotten by all parties, I think it will take a few years... FML

TLDR: flatmate and his friend found me passed out in bathtub with porn blaring out of my laptop

Update: im really fucking embarrassed, I booked a 5 day trip to another country just to get away from this mess.

99% of women are attractive if they're fit,"Like the title states, 99% of fit women are attractive. There was this post of Kurdish women soldiers on r/pics today, and the comment section was filled with highly upvoted variations of ""they only chose attractive women"". This is silly. The vast majority of fit women are attractive. **Being fit IS ATTRACTIVE**, and it applies to both sexes. That's why advice for guys is often ""hit the gym"". Those women looked attractive(although a couple looked plain) because they're in shape. Did you expect them to pick huge ones? Do they even have huge women soldiers? To anyone that got ""triggered"" with that pic, you can be attractive too if you hit the gym and get fit. To anyone that disagrees, find me a pic of a large group of fit women where 50%+ are unattractive.

Edit: I'd like to clarify some things. By fit, I meant having a healthy BMI. You don't have to exercise and be ripped to achieve that. Also, the statement that 99% of fit women are attractive does not mean that you have to be fit to be attractive. There are lots of hot and awesome thick woman out there, but I think over 50% of big women are unattractive.",unpopularopinion

He even said I could ""be a spectator"" when they do it tomorrow night, and that girlfriends of the other roommates had been ""in the audience"" before. 

I was so mortified and astounded by this that I had to leave. He keeps texting me saying he is amazed by my ""hilarious reaction"" and that I need to ""chill"".

My coworker admitted to making false reports against my ex-boyfriend to get him disqualified from becoming a police officer.,"About 6 months ago, my boyfriend was permanently disqualified during his application process to become a police officer. It was very odd as he's never had any legal trouble, he's never done drugs, there was really no reason to be disqualified. He has a criminal justice degree, he volunteered with the police department and he has background in security. The police refused to disclose why he was disqualified.

Well after hanging out with a mutual coworker, he very openly told me he was trying to ruin my boyfriends life and he filed a report saying my boyfriend threatened him and was very temperamental and aggressive and that he was scared of him. They worked together and went to highschool together. 

He then told me to make sure I told my boyfriend because he wanted to start a physical altercation in order to get him arrested. He even told my boyfriend's brother, but he didn't say anythin because he didn't want to cause a fight. 

I feel like I'm in a very bad position. Would showing the police our texts possibly get the disqualification reversed? Is there anything I can do legally? It's been about 6 months since the disqualification and I'm in arizona.

Edit: I wanted to add, his reasoning for doing this is because he wanted to also ruin our relationship because he wanted to be with me.",legaladvice
"Trying my luck on this sub. ""My [37M] Son [21M] Slept With My Girlfriend [32], I Don't Know How To Process This Level Of Betrayal""","**Deleted off the other relationship sub, advised to repost here**

I apologize in advance if this isn't the most coherent thing in the world, this is partially just me venting to the void. About 4 years ago I lost my wife, the mother of my son, to lung cancer. We had been together since we were 14. It was the darkest time in my life, I had considered suicide on a nearly daily basis. I pushed on for my son, and because my wife made me promise to make the most of life.

We had our son pretty young, I worked two jobs to keep us afloat and thankfully was able to provide a decent upbringing until he moved out at 16, although I still paid (and continued to do so until this happened) a portion of his bills. The loss was extremely hard on my son as well, he came back to stay with me for awhile and we'd work through the grief together every day. I got him into therapy, pushed him to get involved in things to keep his mind busy and when he moved back into his apartment I'd call every night to check on him and visited multiple times a week. We were always extremely close.

My wife told me outright after her diagnosis that she didn't want me alone, so I made myself available. My girlfriend and I met about two years ago and hit it off. She isn't my wife, but I loved her for who she was and we really connected. I was reluctant to introduce her to my son because I was afraid he'd feel I was betraying his mother so I held off for the first year, which I regretted as they ended up getting along very well. We'd hang out together, my son was happy, I was happy. She moved in with me about 5 months ago.

This past Thursday he was over for dinner and movies. We've had this little game since he was a teenager where I'd pop up over his shoulder when he was on his phone in common areas and say ""stop looking at that!"" in an accusing way to mess with him even though he was never looking at anything. Turns out this time he was doing something and I seen topless photos on his phone. I recognized the photos to be of my girlfriend, same tattoo placement between the breasts. I grabbed the phone from him and he immediately starts pleading his case. I go into gallery and there are easily two dozen photos of my girlfriend, some of him I'm assuming he sent to her, one or two of them together. By this time he's crying and trying to grab the phone back, I check his texts and he has two weeks worth of conversations with her (under a different name) detailing the fact they've been fucking around behind my back. My girlfriend is in the room begging to know what's going on.

I'm not proud of the fact I lost myself. I screamed at them both, I smashed the phone (yes, I know this is unacceptable, yes I'm in therapy, yes it's the first time I got aggressive with either of them), I demanded details. My son kept apologizing and saying he didn't know why and that it had only started two weeks ago, they slept together 3 times. My girlfriend was sobbing and kept trying to hug me, telling me it was ""a mistake"", purely physical and that she'd never speak to him again. I screamed at my son that I'd given my life to him, that he knew what this meant to me, that he was all I had left. I pulled him upstairs and gave him the money for his phone and kicked him out. I went upstairs to our bedroom, turned her drawers upside down and packed her clothes into two travel bags while she kept asking me to listen. I put them outside, guided her through the door and told her she could have someone else get the rest of her belongings this week.

Both of them have been texting me nonstop until last night, at which point I blocked their number. I feel completely detached. The fact that after 2 years my girlfriend, knowing my history, could betray me is painful enough, and absolutely nothing will make me forgive her. She refuses to get her stuff until I talk to her so I'm having a friend drop it off to her. The fact my son, who I dropped everything for, worked non-stop to provide for, who was all I had left in this world could do this to me knowing what it would do is another pain entirely. It feels like I lost another family member. I ache for my wife all over again. I know everyone processes grief differently but this was two years after her passing, he had a girlfriend and I was there for him (as were therapists) every step of the way, so I have a hard time believing grief is the cause of his decision. I can't see this as a mistake, he didn't trip and fall. It was a conscious choice to betray someone who loved him.

I want to honor my wife by giving my son a chance, to hold on to the little family I have left. But this isn't like he stole money from me, it isn't even something that happened once while drunk. He was there for that grief with me, he knew how hard it was for me to move on. Of all the women, he chose mine. All the apologies or future effort can'r erase that fact or the memory of it. I never did wrong by him, and now I feel like the kid I raised isn't there anymore. Thanks to friends I'm not drifting into thoughts of self harm again, but I don't know if I have it in me to ever forgive him. If and when that day comes, what steps can I take to process what happened, talk to him without feeling disgust and open the door to trusting him again? And if that day never comes, does that make me a bad person?

**Edit** Some brief clarification since people on the other relationship sub took this and ran with it. 1.) Nothing caused him to move out, he asked and said it'd be cool and I helped pay his bills. No hidden resentment I've ever been aware of. 2.) Yes, popping up over his shoulder sometimes was something we both found funny. No I wasn't actually trying to invade his privacy, yes he was a part of the joke. 3.) Yes I know I was aggressive. I paid for the phone and will be discussing it in therapy. 4.) Yes I know this sounds like something out of a movie, it's not.

**TL;DR**: Lost my wife four years ago, just me and my son ever since. Found out he's sleeping with my girlfriend, feel completely empty inside. Need some sort of comfort or advice on how or if this can ever be fixed between him and I, and if that doesn't happen will I ever feel whole on my own again.",relationship_advice
"LPT: A goal towards a tidier home is not through periodic 'binge cleaning' but by keeping the house clean through small, everyday tasks.","To have a tidy, livable house that is always ready for unexpected visitors, you should focus on small tasks that keep your house clean everyday.

For example: If you pick up a book or a magazine up or play a board game, put it back after use.

If you use a blanket, fold it up after you get up. Anything that is displaced when in use - even a pencil or a remote.

Instead of piling dishes in the sink, try to wash your cup or plate immediately after you use it. This will leave the sink free and you will only need to wash the larger cooking dishes after you're done cooking. 
[EXTRA PROTIP: if you have something on the kitchen counter, put it where it belongs (even in the sink) so that your counter is always clear. Even if your sink is piled up with large dishes but you have clean counters, it's still a better look than a tidy sink surrounded by dirty counters.]

What this leaves is a tidier, clutter free home which will only require mostly vaccuming, dusting, and/or mopping. When unexpected visitors arrive, you don't have to scramble.

I never have to do much in my room. My closet is a bit tougher to maintain but the rest of the things are always tidy and in their place. I have siblings who keep their rooms messy and then they binge clean later. It works for them but I don't think thats an efficient method.

Of course its harder when there are more people in the house, but if you encourage as many people as you can then the clutter will reduce.

EDIT: Massive response, thanks! The point is to do small tasks everyday so that it 1) doesn't buildup 2) helps you maintain a habit of cleanliness where you naturally clean something the moment you see it 3) makes your home's default setting as 'clean' :) 

Also, if your house is massively cluttered, then it's a good idea to do a binge clean first and then maintain it by doing small chores everyday. It's said that if you do something for long enough, say 40 days, it becomes a habit. 
EDIT 2: When you rely on binge cleaning, your mindset is that you don't want to do it now because you can do it later. This makes you less likely to clean as you go. Whats the point when you can do it later? So the best way is to binge clean once and maintain it by cleaning after yourself.
Also i missed a word in the title, sorry!

Neighbor threatening to sue over wheelchair ramp,"My boyfriend has mobility issues and uses either a wheelchair or crutches depending on his pain levels. I've done a lot of home improvement projects to ensure he can get around my house easily, including a wheelchair ramp up to my front door. My front door is really recessed from the street due to my lawn and hidden by my porch, so the ramp isn't very visible from the street. I painted it to match the house as well.

Few months ago, a new family moved across the street and the wife's never been very friendly with me like my other neighbors are, which I chalked up to her being shy or whatever.

Bunnies are as much work as a cat, if not even more! (ok, it seems they are much more work than a cat)

They poop. A lot.

You need to clean their toilets. A Lot.

You need at least 2 Bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be Spayed*)


Bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.

Bunnies are not for picking up! They are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!

They need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.

You need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)

AITA got a tarantula so the in-laws stop coming by,"I have insufferable in laws. Father in law is manageable, but mother in law is crazy.

Wife has ignored my concerns for years. To be fair, she's in a tough spot as standing up to Chinese parents is a pain I guess.

Anyway, mother in law is arachnophobic. A few months ago she went crazy after a (wolf?) spider was simply in the corner doing nothing. Panic attack and all.

The hospital has placed a wire in my arm that I believe acts as a tracking device. It is quite obvious, especially when I flex my arm-- I can see it bulge in my wrist. I tried to take a picture but imgur is not letting me upload.

This has caused me great distress. I stay locked in my house because I'm afraid of going somewhere or doing something ""wrong"" and getting forced back to the hospital.

1. The insertion of the tracking device without my consent-- surely that's not legal? My understanding is the patient has to consent before a medical procedure is done.

2. The distress caused by this, does that count as damages? Should I sue?

3. How on earth do I get the wire removed? I don't have money to pay a surgeon to remove it. Can I get the psych hospital to pay for it?

**Good News!** My husband talked to him yesterday and R finally moved out last night. R gave him the following excuses: he couldn't find his sheets, he didn't have internet and that his new room mate had been out of town. I say excuses because I think it sounds like BS. R's new roommate has been living in that place for months at least, so most definitely has the internet set up. I know they are splitting the bill not having separate accounts. And I feel like the roommate being out of town would actually be a good time to get the rest of his things moved in and set up.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: R mentioned last night that he had leftover food at the new place which means he's been at the new place, I think likely sleeping there since he hasn't been sleeping here. Even if he didn't have internet, why was he still showering here in the morning and keeping his clothes here. Even if he has been sleeping at his girlfriend's house, why would he drive all the way to the new place just to drop off food?

Idk, I might just be bitter.

**Cleaning Update:** Although he didn't take out the trash last night, it is all in a bag. The bathroom is relatively cleaner because I left disinfectant and bleach all over it the day before yesterday so he was forced to wipe it up. It will need another pass, but screw it. He told my husband that he would come back today to vaccuum, finish cleaning etc. If he does, great, but at this point it is no longer disgusting so I don't mind finishing up.

My (18f) parents are disowned me and kicked me out because I accidentally got pregnant,"Edit: Sorry for that glaring typo in the title.

This entire situation blew up so fast in my face that I'm still reeling.

I should probably preface this by saying that my parents are extremely strict Asian immigrant parents. It's always been education and academics before love and support. I grew up being physically beat for getting a single ""B"" grade on my report card and having to give my mother my passwords to all of my accounts. Nevertheless, I obeyed their every command. I graduated just last week in the top 10% of my class and am going to Brown University on an almost full-ride (more on that later in regards to the current situation) this fall. 

Following my college acceptances, I probably breathed the biggest sigh of relief in my entire life. My parents finally had nothing to complain about since I fulfilled their biggest dream for me: ""to get into an Ivy League school."" All was good for about a month. My parents finally stopped reading my text messages, tracking my every move, etc. I was free to go out with friends, spend time with my *secret* boyfriend, and just enjoy being a high schooler. 

My boyfriend and I have been together since last summer, so almost a year now. My parents had their suspicions about us in the beginning but I brushed it off and faked my way into making them believe he was just a friend. But after I committed to Brown and they seemed happy enough, I became more lax about hanging out with him and I think they figured it out. 

We started being sexually active in December but have always been incredibly careful about using protection. The only time where I'm not 100% sure we were careful was during spring break when we went to Mexico with a couple of our friends and got drunk and had sex. It would make a lot of sense if that's when it happened. Now, I fully understand that we were both stupid and should have exercised a lot more caution. It's our fault completely and I'm not saying otherwise.

Fast-forward to about a week ago. I'm starting to get weird period-like symptoms, but no period. At that point, I honestly just knew. It was like this weird gut feeling and I freaked the fuck out. My boyfriend was incredibly supportive and drove me over to his house where he'd already gotten tests and had me take two of the pretty expensive ones. All positive. I broke down and cried for hours. 

When I got home, I was still visibly upset despite trying my best to hide it. But I wasn't acting carefully or thinking rationally because of everything that happened. I spoke to him explicitly about the situation over a messaging app that my mom has my password to. In retrospect, she definitely suspected that something happened between me and him (probably a break-up) so she logged on to read our messages. 

The very next day, I wake up to the sound of my mom lugging all of my stuff out of my room and throwing it onto our lawn. I get up and ask what the fuck she's doing and she's crying and calling me the nastiest stuff in Chinese like, ""You're a whore, just kill yourself,"" or, ""I should have gave you up for adoption you useless piece of shit."" And other completely ridiculous things like, ""Now you're a prostitute and no longer a virgin, no good boy will ever want to marry you now."" 

I was begging her to stop but the more I did the angrier she got. She was breaking the majority of my stuff, tearing up my work/papers, smashing my photographs, etc. All I could to was call my boyfriend and have him pick me up. 

It's been three days since that happened. I've picked up all of my stuff, at least the stuff that isn't irreparably damaged. My mother or father is not returning any of my calls but continuously sends me brutal text messages about how much of a failure and disappointment I am and how I turned into a prostitute. She also communicated that she will no longer be paying for my education at Brown and that I will never be allowed to call her my mother and have any interaction with her. My yearly tuition not including personal expenses is around $15,000. I have about $10,000 in my own personal checking account from just working a few jobs throughout high school. However, that's not counting the birthday money I've received and the money that my grandfather left me when he passed. Those are in a separate account being controlled by my mother. There's about $75,000 in there and I have no idea how I'm going to get it back.

I'm currently living with my boyfriend. His parents are at a complete loss as to why my parents are behaving this way and I am so ashamed. They've been nothing but supportive of us, even going as far as to offer to pay for whatever choice I end up making about the baby. We've both decided that I'll get an abortion and he's currently working on figuring all of that out while I'm still worrying about my entire fucking future. 

I don't know why but I just feel so incredibly alone at this moment despite having my boyfriend and his family. I can't my best friends because I don't want this to spread and I obviously have no familial support. I'm just so lost. What should I even do at this point? 

TL;DR: Strict Asian parents disowned me and kicked me out of the house after snooping and finding out I was pregnant. They've cut off all contact and refuses to pay for my college tuition. I fully plan on attending Brown this fall after getting the abortion, but I have no money. I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. Any advice appreciated.",relationship_advice

[UPDATE]I'm feeling a lot of anger about this child[M5] of my[M39] wife's[F39] affair that I've been talked into being a father figure for.,"[First post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cctm2u/im_feeling_a_lot_of_anger_about_this_childm5_of/)

Hey everyone it's been a few weeks since you heard from me. I guess I'm kind of in a spot to update now.

So, my post got a lot of feedback and it was *pretty much* unanimous. I heard from lots of people; parents and sons and daughters in blended families, people who'd been cheated on themselves, people who were Max in their own families and you all told me what I should have been able to admit myself, that this was not normal, that no one had ever heard of an arrangement like this.

I resolved to end the arrangement and met with my ex wife and her partner to tell them a few days after I posted, midway through their custody week. Many people advised me to speak to my boys about it first, like my ex did to me, but I wanted to deliver the message before having to take Max again. I was thinking that it might be better to instead call them out on that behaviour and try to get them to agree not to include the boys in that level of discussion before me, and then we could all sit down with the boys.

The meeting did not go well. They were both pretty mad at me. I had tried to prepare for it to be uncomfortable. I told myself just to be polite and firm, that I didn't owe them an explanations beyond ""I'm sorry, its not working out"". I guess he had made some career move based on this schedule that I was fucking up. In hindsight I do feel sort of responsible for that frustration, in that I regret agreeing to this arrangement in the first place, but in the moment I really was not giving a fuck about this man's work life balance. Then, he said something about how I wasn't being ""fair"", that they just wanted a ""fair"" custody arrangement. That made me very mad. Thinking about this all to type it out has my heart hammering. I have some different opinions on ""fairness"". I said some pretty shitty, regrettable things to both of them and then we were all screaming at each other for awhile and then I stormed out and I didn't talk to the boys.

I didn't get to talk to my boys for several days until hand off. They immediately were asking about why Max wasn't with them and I, prepared for it, held a more serious talk with them than I had up to this point. I talked about how its great that they enjoy spending time with Max, but that I'm their father and that Max has his own father to spend time with. I also talked about how this whole spectacle of our lives is difficult for me, that I don't like having to spend only every other week with them. That their mother's decision to start another family with Max's father and Max still makes me sad. This is pretty awfully difficult stuff to talk about. I've been pretty strict with myself about not venting to my son's about their mother up until now, but effectively that's meant I haven't really talked about her or our breakup at all. If you can't say anything nice, as they say.

Trying to maintain that respect for their mother and also talk frankly about my own feelings is a difficult tightrope balance. I don't want to blame their mother, but I also don't want to *not* blame their mother, if you know what I mean. This would be one of the situations I identify as ""unfair"", where the responsible thing is to never say anything disparaging or ""poisonous"" to my sons about their mother, my ex, but that means I have to describe the current state of affairs and what has happened to get here in a way that isn't disparaging to their mother and act like this is normal. ""She decided"".

I think I actually did a good job navigating the conversation. My sons absorbed it easier than I expected. A few weeks later and things with them are basically normal. 

I have had a few short conversations with my ex since our big embarrassing blowup. I sort of feel like I want her to apologize for this whole thing, but also know that I'm not doing myself any favours waiting for that to happen. I think she remains upset with me, more for the things I said than the rejection of this arrangement with Max. Or maybe that's just projection, because that's what I feel guilty for. I also regret that the last time I spoke to Max was dropping him off before ending the arrangement. I don't know. I guess his mom has explained to him that she missed him too much, to have him gone each week, but I don't know how sturdy that story will be.

Rereading my last post has me feeling pretty shameful of how I talked about Max. I know he doesn't deserve my sustained ire and that he's not going anywhere, so I'll have to be able to adjust to his presence. I'm obviously holding on to a lot of anger that is really about my ex wife but she isn't obligated to give a shit about that and I am obligated to interact with her politely so I guess that anger just got set aside and then vented onto Max just because he was there in my face, but that was my own fault.

So, I sort of expect things will pretty much return to normal from here. Contact with my ex is curt right now, but that'll loosen up.
Thanks to almost everyone who commented or reached out to me.",relationship_advice

TIFU by melting my mother's wedding gift and getting my house infested with tarantulas.,"This happened about two years ago in the summer when I was home from college. 

So background story, I am infamous among my friends for being horrible at cooking because I get really impatient when it comes to food. I hate waiting for water to boil or waiting for the oven to preheat and I'm bad at following directions. I have flooded microwaves trying to make microwave mac n cheese, burnt soups, and unforgettably melted my mom's $400 wedding gift pot. 

My mom loves to cook and often makes these delicious broths that she boils for hours on staying up during the night which she boils through the morning and turns the stove off in the afternoon. 

On this particular morning, she made it on a weekday and therefore had to go to work in the morning and put me in charge of turning the stove off in the afternoon. I was like okay mom no big deal I can't fuck this up, wrong. After standing in the kitchen for a solid 2 minutes I get bored of waiting and take a nap setting the alarm for noon, fuck up number one. 

When I wake up, I hear fire alarms going off and look at my phone feeling betrayed because my alarm never went off only to realize I had set the alarm for 12 AM instead of PM. I run downstairs to the kitchen to find it filled with smoke. I immediately turn off the stove and run to open all the windows and doors. I go back to the stove and lift the pot and lo and behold the bottom of the pot melted off from the rest of the pot, bubbling and hardening into molten metal. 

I quickly bring the pot outside and try to scrape off the molten metal off of my glass stove with a spatula, fuck up number two. As I frantically scrape up a chunck of the hardening goo I hear my stove crack. I think ""shit, I just melted a pot and cracked my stove all in one day this cannot get any worse"", wrong. 

Because I had opened all the doors and windows a freaking tarantula, A TARANTULA??!! (By the way this is in Georgia so tarantulas are not common here and I had never come across one until this day) crawled in through the door and made its way into the kitchen. Now this was when that viral video of the guy swatting a tarantula with a broom resulted in it exploding into million baby tarantulas. I had the maybe I shouldn't smack the tarantula thought in the back of my head but when that mother fucker moved I screamed and smacked it with a fly swatter, fuck up number three. 

All hell breaks loose and it explodes into millions of baby tarantulas. I was mortified and tried to spray ant poison at it but by the time I found the spray can many of the baby tarantulas had made it way to different parts of my house. 

I now had to call my mother telling her I almost set the house on fire, wasted her time and efforts going into the broth, melted her wedding gift pot, cracked the stove, and infested the house with tarantulas. My mom came home immediately and after getting an earful of anger and confusion she told me to make myself useful and move the bed in the third floor guest room to my room on the second floor. I rush over in shame and begin to move the box for the bed down the stairs until I see a baby tarantula crawling on the wall and drop the corner of the bed box on my foot. I wailed in pain and just broke down and cried like a bitch. 

My mom rushes over and starts laughing at how ridiculous I am and said ""poor sharonoelee nothing ever goes right does it"" and deems I had enough and makes me sit on my bed and keep my hands to myself so I don't cause any more accidents. 

It was a horrible day and I had a persisting limp for a good 2 weeks, but I can laugh about it now. 

TL;DR: forgot to turn off stove, almost burn down my house, melted my mom's wedding gift pot, cracked the glass stove by scraping the melted pot off with a spatula, tarantula entered in through opened door, when I smacked it, it exploded into millions of baby tarantulas infesting my house, fun stuff.


Edit: The wolf spider looks almost even more terrifying than the tarantula/spider demon I encountered in my house. The mother and the babies were all black, hairy, and the mother was bigger than my hand. Thankfully, hopefully, none of the baby tarantulas grew up to be that size *shudder* but I do not need more pictures of spiders in my life, please do not send me any more pictures of spiders please and thank you.

Edit #2: Some people are confused as to why my mom sent me to move the bed. I came home from college for the summer so my bed was in my apartment in another town so I had to move the extra bed from the guest room to my room, sorry for the confusion.

Edit #3: To those saying the stove was long gone before I scraped it with the spatula, there is a crater in my stove because the stove actually melted too and the crack grows every year. We still use the stove, three out of the four heating spots still work! I think I managed to do about $3,000 in damage in one day (sorry mom and dad, I love you).

Edit 3.5: I will relink my photos of the incident into the edit tomorrow, afternoon, whenever I wake up... thank you for all your kindness and not kindness they all made me laugh throughout the day!

Edit 4: [pictures from that day] (http://imgur.com/a/kVno8) I don't have pictures of the tarantula/spider demons because it was such a chaotic day and the last thing I would have wanted was to have pictures of them on my phone. I go home in about 2 weeks so I'll post pictures of the crater in my stove which I named Timmy.",tifu
AITA for disagreeing with my friend's idea of a 'microaggression'?,"I recently caught up with my high school friend attending a far away university whom I had not seen in months yesterday. Unlike her I go to a local community college and asked what it is like for her living in a dorm and what kind of rules she had to follow. This led her to tell me about the sensitivity education she had received, partially towards minorities and what is to be considered offensive to certain groups but not obviously offensive in the perspective of the person making the statement. She gave me an example and said that telling a black person ""I like your hair"" is a microaggression.

I told her that is ridiculous and borderline insanity to say that giving a compliment to someone is considered offensive. After hearing what I said she got considerably upset and said that I was a mildly racist and told me to get educated because we live in the year 2019. So AITA because I haven't caught up with the current social norms or is she being ridiculous?",AmItheAsshole

"My daughter (7) keeps getting touched inappropriately at school, school brushing it off (Washington)","On a near daily basis, my daughter (age 7) is getting groped by a boy at school.  She says he typically does it when the class is lining up and when the teacher is not looking, or at recess.  So far he has touched her butt, her chest, and proclaimed ""we should have sex.""

We talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  This has not helped.  We escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  Not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

The principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""  The read between the lines comment was: ""the boy's parents are not taking the issue seriously.""  The principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

"My sister(F22) ripped up my(F19) Stan Lee autograph and I haven't forgiven her even if my mom(46F) is pressuring me to, for families sake.","I made a post yesterday but forgot my password so I made a new alt.

Okay so I am a huge Marvel nerd. The kind of nerd that Cosplays, goes to cons and draws her own stuff. Mostly fanservice.

My sister ridicules my hobby saying that it's pathetic and ""retarded"". She claims I am delusional as a grown woman playing dress up.

Besides that we have a good relationship. We are not friends but sisters if that makes sense.

So 3 years ago I managed to safe up enough to go to a con in the USA and meet the real Stan Lee! He signed one of my own pictures I did of the big 3 and complimented it. It's was one of the best days of my life.
Since then the signed picture has always been on my wall.

Flash forward. A few weeks ago my sister asks for my jacket and I tell her no. Reason being that she was a bitch to me the whole week. She pouted and I left the house.

When I come back is see my fucking Stan Lee autograph ripped up on the flor! I fucking lost it. Then my sister came in and started teasing me (look at that  grown ass woman crying over a piece of paper). When she saw that I was for real distressed she started saying that it was just a piece of paper that I can get a new one.

I pushed her out of my room and have been extremely short with her since. She tries to engage in conversation but I shoot her down. She tries to bribe me with movie tickets and I tell her to go with her boyfriend etc. She hasn't apologized for it. She just says that I should be over it by now.

My mom says the same. She says a materialistic things shouldn't come In between family and that I should simply let it go. My dad is also really mad at sister and by extention mom. He is as big on Marvel as me and he was livid when he found out. This whole ordeal is literally splitting our family apart.

My mother and sister think i am being unfair by not letting go and I think they both disrespected me. Mom is mad at dad for not ""talking sense into me and taking my side"" and dad is mad at mom for ""failing to punish my sister and spoiling her""

I feel awfully guilty but also raging mad. Can somone help me with this?

Edit :thanks guys for listening to me. I feel a lot better. I will take what many of you said and I am going to send them examples of how much Stan Lee's autograph costs. But I think I have to word it very good so that they don't think that I would ""split up the family over money""

Update : Thanks for the support. My dad and I found somone that restored pictures and we are taking my piece to it.

WIBTA if I called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?,"My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I've been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I've always been supportive of him and his identity. 

I've been with my fiancé now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I've gotten to know him really well. However my fiancé told me recently that she does not want my son's boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He's my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It's my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. 

After that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn't been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it's unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his ""step grandparents"" in the future anyway. I still don't feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?",AmItheAsshole

"WIBTA if I ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?","My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.

So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty.

Bonus update: I've gotten like 5 messages that you can't tell sex of the baby that early, and y'all can go take it up with the tech who seemed pretty fucking sure of herself.

(Sorry I posted this like an hour ago and then got super paranoid my older son was going to see it so I deleted it, but I just low-key found out he doesn't even go on Reddit anymore so I'm going to try this again.

Hey this is really shitty but I'm 39F and mother of two teens, and married to a (40M) guy I'll call Steve. Sorry if this is all a mess, it's a bit of a messed up story

The marriage was basically one of convenience. Steve and I are both divorced and have been friends for decades. This past spring Steve found out he has a rare cancer and the doctors gave him 6ish months to live.

Three years ago Steve sought out the daughter he had before his marriage from a one night stand in his 20s. When he found her he discovered his daughter (10 years old, I'll call her Sara), was being horrifically abused by her mother, who had had some kind of mental break I guess. Anyway he spent a year fighting for custody of this child he hadn't seen since she was a baby, and he eventually got it, then spent 2ish years working with her and getting her to heal and trust him and SURPRISE! he's fucking dying.

Anyway the marriage thing was mostly about Sara. We were advised that is getting married would be the quickest/easiest way to make sure I get custody of Sara when Steve passes, in case Sara's mother decides to try for custody again.

And as a side note I 100% do want custody of Sara, no question, I love her very very much. She's already like a sister to my two kids and similar in age. That girl has gone from not owning a fucking pair of shoes to being a funny, smart, all around great kid.

Anyway we got married on paper (no wedding), and Steve and Sara moved into my house. All the kids knew what was happening and were surprisingly cool with it.

Yeah so, stuff happened between me and Steve. He confessed he had been in love with me for a long time, and I just kind of said it all back to him even though I'm not 100% sure of my feelings. It all just happened fast idk. Maybe that was wrong of me but I wanted his time left to be happy and I do care for him a lot

In the last few weeks Steve has gone downhill very quickly. He is still mostly at home except for a few short hospital stays. There are nurses that come every day and he is on strong pain medicine, so sometimes he's himself but a lot of times really out of it. He's basically just here dying right in front of my fucking eyes and it sucks.

And I just found out this week that I'm pregnant. I'm not sure that I want to keep the baby. I'm old as dirt with now 3 teenage kids to think of. I'm strongly considering not telling Steve at all, but it feels very wrong.

Telling him also feels wrong. He's more upset about leaving Sara than he is about dying, so finding out he's leaving another kid behind will probably only hurt him.

Having an abortion feels wrong. Keeping the kid feels wrong. Nothing about this is okay and I really just want a cigarette and a bottle of wine.

TL;DR hahahaha life sucks

Update: I am pretty sure I'm going to keep the baby and tell Steve, but I want to sleep on it first (also Steve is definitely out for the night). Thanks for listening. Going to do the dishes, feed the cat, and go to bed. Will continue to read and respond to comments when I can and hopefully update at some point before the weekend.

Update update: Saw obgyn this morning way too early (seriously why are you even open at 8am?) and here's the twist: I'm not a month pregnant, I'm like 3+ months pregnant. No I'm not relieved, I'm pissed off that I had another choice taken away from me. I'm sick of my life feeling like a speeding train that I have no control over. I'm sick of everyone romanticising everything. I'm tired of everyone saying I'm strong when I feel like I'm just doing the bare minimum to keep my head above water.

"*UPDATE - Don't want to have a ""Click-Bait"" Title - Wife's Wedding Band(s)","[**\*\*\*Original Post\*\*\***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b8kigy/cant_wait_until_thursdaymy48m_wife44f_is_going_to/)

So, I have just returned from lunch, where my wife received her new bands.  We kept it low key, no pictures/video, and semi-private.  What we did was planned to take her cut band to a local jeweler after lunch, and invited our two sons to lunch before the ""appointment"".  While ordering, Oldest son asks to see the damaged/cut wedding band, saying he might be able to fix it, he takes it below the table and starts acting like he is squeezing and straining, and then places a complete ""fixed"" band on the table, and asks his mom if that works, she is ASTOUNDED, and places the band on her finger, but....it is too big.  Youngest son says he can fix THAT and asks for the band, wife reluctantly and with a look of ""WTF is going on"" on her face, hands the band to our youngest, he takes it below the table, and squeezes and strains, and makes it ""smaller, but not quite perfect"" when she puts it on.  She is now trying to figure it out, and as she takes it off and starts to inspect it, I take it away from her and do the same ""act"" as our boys, but this time, the band fits PERFECTLY on her finger, and she has quite LITERALLY had enough!  She finally takes it off, and is inspecting it pretty hard, and cannot figure it out.....until My oldest places her cut and older band on the table, our youngest places the too large band on the table, and I place the next size on the table.  At this point she's just staring at all of us, and I explain what had happened, and how I was able to find the jeweler, etc.  I even showed her the Reddit post.  She didn't start crying until reading about the comments and all the caring and support you guys posted.  Lunch was ordered, we all talked about everything, ate lunch as a family, parted ways back to respective work, home, etc.

She (wife) did mention that after reading all the replies, she would have KILLED me if I had gone full public display, and all that, so very thankful to those that suggested to keep it low key and semi-private.

So, about the jeweler.  They responded to my email regarding posting the name/info, and would like to maintain their privacy.  The oldest son IS making jewelry and doing repairs ONLY to catch up previous orders and work requests prior to their fathers passing.  Once it is all caught up, they are closing it for good.  They sent copies of the drawings and mold for our bands and we placed them in our safe at home in case this happens again, we can get something made/designed.  I followed up asking if there was ANY way to repay their kindness, and haven't had a response.  Regardless, my wife is planning on hitting up some local spots and making them a ""Texan"" Gift Package and sending it to them.

And that's it.  She is extremely happy and overjoyed.  I am really glad it's ""over"" as I had NO idea this would garner this much attention, and can now go back to our normal lives.  Thanks to everyone for their suggestions, and we are grateful to all the outpouring of genuine caring, thank you to everyone that sent Silver, Gold, and Platinum, it wasn't necessary but greatly appreciated.

***Edit - I keep reading comments about the Jewelers, and this being fake.  The Daughter, Son, and an Uncle are all working part time to finish work that was commissioned prior to their fathers passing.

"[Indiana] Landlord pulls rental agreement when he meets me for the first time, refuses to refund my $100 application fee, I think it's because I'm black.","I found a great place on Craigslist several weeks ago that was going to be available on Tuesday. When I called, the guy was very polite, talked me through everything, sent me the link to the rental application on his website, made everything really simple. I did some research myself to make sure it was all above board, being on Craigslist and all, and the phone number and website definitely match up to the property owner. There's no office since it's only a 16 unit building but the guy is locally known for owning it. It definitely isn't a ""meet me at starbucks with cash/money order"" type of apartment listings, it's real.


Since I live out of state I knew I wouldn't be able to see the inside of it first, but a friend who lived in the same building a couple of years ago said they've just been renovated and he confirmed the pictures were what I could expect. Great! Send in the application and $100 admin fee, he contacts the place I rent from now, gets my credit and calls my work. A week later he emails me and says that everything came back good, he'd just need the first month of rent and a $250 deposit on the day I move in.


Fast forward to yesterday and I meet the owner there at 10 am. I tell him my name and he goes ""The same (my name) who I've been talking to at (my phone number)"" Yep that's me. ""And your email address is (my email address)?"" Yes it is. And he just stood there for about 10 seconds looking at the paperwork and said he'd be right back. He went to his car and I think he got on the phone. Maybe 5 minutes later he comes back and says ""I'm sorry, but there's been a mistake, your credit came back unsatisfactory, you can't have the apartment""


When I told him I don't have any loans - student or car, and I pay my credit card off every month so I can't possibly have bad credit he just said ""Sorry, it's not available"" as he's basically jogging back to his car at this point. He just drove off, I'm standing there alone flabbergasted, what the hell just happened?


As I'm driving to my friends house to help him clear some space in his garage for my furniture, which is now on its way with the movers and I have to change the delivery address, it hits me. This guy hadn't seen me before, my name is something very common so he couldn't have known what I look like. He just lied to me and refused to rent to me, after he said everything was fine, because I'm black.


When I emailed him demanding the $100 fee back he replied back with ""Sorry, that fee is non-refundable"" I'm out nearly $1000 from the movers, the $100 for the admin fee and I'm probably going to have to take the first thing I can find apartment-wise because I don't want to be a burden to my friend in his guest bedroom.


How can I get my $100 back and possibly my mover's fee from this guy?",legaladvice

TIFU by starting small talk with a kind little dude on the subway.,"Yesterday I got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. I squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. I notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where I'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. He looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. As a larger human, 6'3"" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.

Though I couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so I decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. As I sat down I thanked him for making room and told him I really appreciated the gesture. We high-fived and in hindsight I should have ended it there.

I noticed he had his backpack with him so I asked how school was that day. He told me it was just alright. Then I asked the fatal question, ""Do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?"" He let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. Unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.

Her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. She yelled ""Oooo boy!! You told me you finished that yesterday! Guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! You, ya little liar!!!"" His head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 

A few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. He looked back at me as they departed, a look that said ""bro, I thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???"" His look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. 

Hang in there little buddy! One weekend may seem like an eternity at your age, but time flies!

"[Alabama] Tailgated by police for 3 minutes, then searched and ticketed for going 56 in 55","  

I'm driving down a country road with a posted 55 speed limit. Cop car gets in behind me. Bad experiences with cops so I do everything by the books, change to the right lane and use autopilot to maintain the exact speed limit, letting the cop pass.

Cop changes to my lane and starts tailgating instead of passing. I maintain speed limit. After several minutes, the lights and sirens go on and I get pulled over. They search my car and repeatedly make me do several sobriety tests. I ask to blow into a breathalyzer to prove that I don't drink or do drugs but they didn't have one and kept making me do sobriety tests for around 10-20 minutes while searching my car.

They didn't find anything after wasting my time for half an hour, then gave me a traffic ticket for going 56 mph on a 55 mph road.

Not sure if this is legally relevant, but I'm a black male in my 20s with no criminal or traffic violation record. I also had an LSU sticker on the back of my car.

TL;DR Airline says I was a no show on flight (but I can prove I was on it) and cancelled my return reservation - Need Advice,"Need advice or help about traveling home to the US.

​

On August 15th, I flew from the US to Croatia with a stop-over in Munich. My return flight to the US is scheduled for September 4th. I booked my flights through online 3rd party budget ticket agent.

​

My problem is that apparently the airline is saying that I was a no show for my flight from Munich to Zagreb in August, even though I was on the plane. They cancelled my future flight with them on September 4th claiming it is their policy to cancel return flights if a passenger no shows. (But again, I didn't no show. I was on the flight.)

​

I have called my travel agent company multiple times but get the same answer - they tell me every time that they need to verify with the airline, put me on hold, and then tell me the airline will not budge - the airline shows me as a no show and won't reinstate my return flight. The travel agency says there is nothing they can do since it is the airline's policy and the agency wants me to purchase a new return flight, which I cannot really afford, and don't think I should have to anyway.

I called the airline directly and they keep saying that their register is showing me as a no show for the Munich to Zagreb flight. But I was on that flight. When I arrived and boarded the plane in Munich, I was told there was not an actual attendant to check us into the flight so we were guided to scan our tickets and board the plane, which I did, along with the other passengers. There are people who sat next to me on the plane and I had conversations with who can witness I was there, besides airport CCTV which I am sure can prove I boarded the plane and exited the plane in Zagreb. I have a visa stamp in my passport from going through the boarder in the airport. It is so scary to me to think this airline allowed someone to board the plane and has no record of them on the flight. What type of security is that??

​

I need help - I am at a stalemate. I am not sure what to do since I was 100% on that flight and it is the airline who made the mistake. I have been recording the names and numbers and taking notes of all my conversations. Can anyone give advice on what I should do? I have 3 more days before my planned return flight should leave. Any help is greatly appreciated.

​

TL;DR My airline made a mistake and said I was a no show even though I was on the flight. Subsequently, they cancelled my upcoming return flight reservation. Neither the airline nor my travel agent will fix it, as they both push it off on each other.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Thank you all for helpful advice and support! There are definitely some suggestions made I would never think of and I will definitely look into. Just some additional information and updates:

Yes, I'm US citizen.

As someone mentioned about the luggage, I did have issues when I landed in Zagreb, none of my checked bags made it to the destination. Looking back, if they thought I was a no-show they might have pulled it from the plane. However, when I landed I didn't know that was a possibility and just thought my bags didn't arrive. I immediately filed a lost baggage claim, called the airline and they confirmed that my bags were on the next flight to Zagreb. I received my bags the next day. While on the call with the airline there wasn't any mention of me not being on a flight.

&#x200B;

I've spent the afternoon on calls with the airline and they haven't changed their position, although they agreed to pull the flight manifest and notify me when they have more information.

&#x200B;

I had already thrown away my printed boarding pass and luggage tags. I'm making a customer services complaint with documentation of an e-boarding pass, iPhone location data showing me in Munich airport and then after the flight to Zagreb airport (the times match the flight), passport visa stamp and luggage tracking sticker. I'll attempt to get the lost luggage form from the airport as well.",legaladvice

I've decided not to press charges, I don't really have the money/time for it, and all I needed was my medical expenses paid. I just plan on not going to any family gatherings where he is for a long long LONG time.

"TIFU my whole life. My regrets as a 46 year old, and advice to others at a crossroad","TIFU. More like more whole life really.

Hi, I my name's John. I've been lurking for a while, but I've finally made an account to post this. I need to get my life off my chest.  About me. I'm a 46 year old banker and I have been living my whole life the opposite of how I wanted. All my dreams, my passion, gone. In a steady 9-7 job. 6 days a week. For 26 years. I repeatedly chose the safe path for everything, which eventually changed who I was.

Today I found out my wife has been cheating on me for the last 10 years. My son feels nothing for me. I realised I missed my father's funeral FOR NOTHING. I didn't complete my novel, travelling the world, helping the homeless. All these things I thought I knew to be a certainty about myself when i was in my late teens and early twenties. If my younger self had met me today, I would have punched myself in the face. I'll get to how those dreams were crushed soon.

Let's start with a description of me when I was 20. It seemed only yesterday when I was sure I was going to change the world. People loved me, and I loved people. I was innovative, creative, spontaneous, risk-taking and great with people. I had two dreams. The first, was writing a utopic/dystopic book. The second, was travelling the world and helping the poor and homeless.
I had been dating my wife for four years by then. Young love. She loved my spontaneity, my energy, my ability to make people laugh and feel loved. I knew my book was going to change the world. I would show the perspective of the 'bad' and the 'twisted', showing my viewers that everybody thinks differently, that people never think what the do is wrong. I was 70 pages through when i was 20. I am still 70 pages in, at 46. By 20, I had backpacking around New Zealand and the Phillipines. I planned to do all of Asia, then Europe, then America (I live in Australia by the way). To date, I have only been to New Zealand and the Phillipines.

Now, we get to where it all went wrong. My biggest regrets. I was 20. I was the only child. I needed to be stable. I needed to take that graduate job, which would dictate my whole life. To devote my entire life in a 9-7 job. What was I thinking? How could I live, when the job was my life? After coming home, I would eat dinner, prepare my work for the following day, and sleep at 10pm, to wake up at 6am the following day. God, I can't remember the last time I've made love to my wife.

Yesterday, my wife admitted to cheating on me for the last 10 years. 10 years. That seems like a long time, but i can't comprehend it. It doesn't even hurt. She says it's because I've changed. I'm not the person I was. What have I been doing in the last 10 years? Outside of work, I really can't say anything. Not being a proper husband. Not being ME. Who am I? What happened to me? I didn't even ask for a divorce, or yell at her, or cry. I felt NOTHING. Now I can feel a tear as I write this. But not because my wife has been cheating on me, but because I am now realising I have been dying inside. What happened to that fun-loving, risk-taking, energetic person that was me, hungering to change the world? I remember being asked on a date by the most popular girl in the school, but declining her for my now-wife. God, I was really popular with the girls in high school. In university/college too. But i stayed loyal. I didn't explore. I studied everyday. 

Remember all that backpacking and book-writing I told you about? That was all in the first few years of college. I worked part-time and splurged all that I had earned. Now, I save every penny. I don't remember a time I spend anything on anything fun. On anything for myself. What do I even want now?

My father passed ten years ago. I remember getting calls from mom, telling me he was getting sicker and sicker. I was getting busier and busier, on the verge of a big promotion. I kept putting my visit off, hoping in my mind he would hold on. He died, and I got my promotion. I haven't seen him in 15 years. When he died, I told myself it didn't matter what I didn't see him. Being an atheist, I rationalized that being dead, it wouldn't matter anyway. WHAT WAS I THINKING? Rationalizing everything, making excuses to put things off. Excuses. Procrastination. It all leads to one thing, nothing. I rationalized that financial security was the most important thing. I now know, that it definitely is not.
I regret doing nothing with my energy, when I had it. My passions. My youth. I regret letting my job take over my life. I regret being an awful husband, a money-making machine. I regret not finishing my novel, not travelling the world. Not being emotionally there for my son. Being a damn emotionless wallet.

If you're reading this, and you have a whole life ahead of you, please. Don't procrastinate. Don't leave your dreams for later. Relish in your energy, your passions. Don't stay on the internet with all your spare time (unless your passion needs it). Please, do something with your life while your young. DO NOT settle down at 20. DO NOT forget your friends, your family. Yourself. Do NOT waste your life. Your ambitions. Like I did mine. Do not be like me.

Sorry for the long post, just had to get it out there.

TL:DR I realised I let procrastination and money stop me from pursuing my passions when I was younger, and now I am dead inside, old and tired.





Edit: I am quite overwhelmed at the response, thank you for your time. I had posted on a whim, and did not expect the reception.

In regards to my post, I must admit I was quite emotional at the time. As I read what I had written earlier, I can't stop myself from noticing an abundance of spelling and grammatical mistakes, phrases that I would not usually say. I don't think I have used Capital Locks so much in my life. 
However I will not edit them. That would not do it justice.

I have read many of the replies and will try my best to answer the reoccurring questions. I will add that the replies have given me a new perspective of life, Reddit and humanity in general. The amount of encouragement and humour persists to amaze me. Despite my situation, I even found myself laughing at a few of the comments.

What my plans are.
I am planning to cut down my hours substantially. I will take a new job if I have to, as I am relatively well-off. I am going to talk to my wife. Divorce is currently not what I have in mind and I hope that our communication and relationship will improve. If it doesn't, then so be it. We will both move on. I see there are quite a number of negative comments about her, however I am going to have to say in her defence, she really is a lovely person. She is smart, empathetic and has a great sense of humour. I'm not saying it was okay for her to do what she did, but she's not an evil person. I know that. We were both in the fault. We let communication dwindle, and with it, our relationship. There is so much more to being a head of house than just being able to bring in the money. A steady balance of emotional connection, love and finance is what I will strive to give.

My son. I don't any anything about him. I really don't. I have unknowingly distanced myself from him; I only see him around dinner time. I do not recall having a proper conversation with him, it's quite preposterous now that I think about it. I'm not exactly sure how I'll start bonding with him, I have become quite a boring person. However, I plan to change that. I refuse to be a poor role model. I will ensure that he does not make the same mistake I did with my family. I have decided I am going to start watching his basketball games and rugby games on Saturdays. I never have, due to work, but I will ensure that I do. Perhaps I will even play video games with him. There was a time I had a collection of SNES games, and I wasn't half bad either. Who knows, I might really connect with my son, and it seems to be something he enjoys.

In regards to the novel and travelling, I admit, I am a different person from my youth. I no longer have the creativity and desire to complete the novel. When I found the long-forgotten 70 pages, the writing was no longer mine. I have changed substantially in 26 years. I am sorry to disappoint as so many of you seemed incredibly keen to read it. However, I am just as excited to read the stories of all of you aspiring writers that have expressed their passion!
The travelling, I might still do. Family trips probably, in the school holidays. Maybe with my wife every now and then, if she'd have me. 

I can't turn back time and see my father for a final time, though my mother is still alive. She lives in London, so visits are quite difficult. However, I will make an effort to see her. I do love my parents. I only wish I had not prioritised them as I did.

In regards to the advice I have given. I stand by what I said. Live your life. Do not procrastinate and let lethargy stop you. However, I might add, avoid living in poverty. I have had the good fortune to have had never experienced hunger or homelessness. I would imagine chasing your ambitions and being happy would be considerable more difficult without proper nutrition and living standards! I believe someone mentioned their dream was financial stability. I say, that is just as valiant as any dream to have. We are all different and are missing different things in our lives, be honest with yourself and you'll know what you really want.
I believe there were arguments upon my language and university/college or what not. I will clarify that, although Australians generally call tertiary education 'university' here, I have made small efforts to pertain to Americans, as they are the main users, at least I assume. And yes, university/college was free when I attended. I believe Australians now are able to attend them relatively free (upfront) and can pay their fees after they graduate.

I believe I have covered the general scope of questions. 

P.S. Thank you for the gold, I do appreciate it, but they aren't of real value to me. Perhaps if Reddit ever includes a re-gifting gold feature, I will gift them to some of the commenters. And yes, please stop sending me gold! I also believe someone tried to even donate to me? I assure you, money is not what I read. Please save it for yourself!

I don't think I'll come back to Reddit, unless i hear about a way to re-gift gold. I thank you all for your sympathy, your time, and I wish all the best for those in difficult situations. I have faith in your capacity and ability to change, to become happy, to help yourselves. Because after all, you're the person in the best position to.
And no, I am not considering religion, I just do not have the correct mindset. I am logical to the point that I cannot, however that is not to say religion isn't bad, it gives people the hope and sense after death which I really do envy.

Sincerest of Regards,

John.

My gf was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby,"Really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my GF was raped. It was done in a park. She didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. I couldn't force her, so I just stayed with her.

She was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and I've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. We went to therapy, and she knows I'm there for her. She has a history of depression, and I've been really worried.

Last week, we found out she was pregnant. I was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. So the baby definitely isn't mine. She is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

So we had a discussion. She is a devout Catholic. We initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her Mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

I flat out told her that I would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. She cried and begged me not to leave. I told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and I leave, or she aborts the baby and I stay. I would not let this go.

She didn't want either of those things to happen, so I told her we were done...

TIFU by fucking myself with a stick full of maggots.,"NSFL? If you're eating something then I'd suggest not reading this.

You ever seen those stories on the reddit museum of filth? Like, the crusty cum shoebox or the Rainbow Dash figure that was boiled in a jar of cum, and realised 'Why is there no female version of this?'. Well, sit down because I'm about to tell you the story of how I inadvertently fucked myself... with a stick full of maggots.

&#x200B;

So, I have this pool diving stick that I use to fuck myself. I live with my parents so I can't really get an actual toy. Now, this pool toy has two holes on the 'shaft' to allow water to fill in and out of it so it can sink to the bottom of the pool. This also allows it to fill with my girl juices when I use it. The problem? The fluid gets stuck in there since it's relatively more viscous than water. So I've had this thing for about 6 months. I try my best to clean it out by running it under the tap and rinsing it out every couple of weeks but I can never really get the solidly dry stuff. This, combined with the fact that I always just sort of shoved it down the side of my bed, or stuffed it in my bedside cabinet once I was done with it made for a pretty nasty smell. It wasn't usually that obvious unless you got close, but earlier today, once I had finished fucking myself, I put it in my drawer and sat up in my bed. I noticed that not only did it smelled significantly worse than usual, maybe due to the summer heat, but also 'down there' also felt like it was on fire. Not enough to be painful, but enough for me to notice it.

&#x200B;

Here's where the interesting part starts. I decide. 'Hey, It's currently 4AM, everyone is asleep, I can go and cut this thing open.' Sort of like a fucked up episode of 'What's Inside'. So I reach into my drawer, grab my phone and make my way downstairs into the kitchen where I clear out the sink and put this thing down in it. I use a pocket knife to start cutting it open, starting from one of the holes on the side. I'm scared to open it, but I understand that I must, and I put down the pocket knife and gently tease apart the two sides of the incision I made. 

&#x200B;

I. Am. **HORRIFIED.** Dozens of little maggots squirming around inside. I started gagging, until the realisation set in. 'I just stuck this thing inside of me. I may have maggots crawling around inside of my vagina right now.' The fact that they were maggots... doesn't that mean they had been there for a while? How long does it take fly eggs to hatch? In my state of panic, I snapped a quick photo (already knew that I was going to post that thing on 4chan), and rinsed out the entire thing with water, before cutting it into another 3 pieces and thoroughly rinsing them out with bleach and double wrapping them in a plastic bag and throwing it in the bin. I return to my room, disgusted, and make a [4chan post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/c6uwi5/femanon_embraces_her_inner_neckbeard/) I didn't know what to do after that, except wait for my family to wake up so I could have a shower without worrying about disturbing them. I have my shower and take a nap. That's the end.",tifu
"Fiancee (28f) cheated after her cousin's funeral while I (28m) was away, together 6 1/2 years","I had to go away for a little over a week for work last week. Her cousin passed away on Wednesday, the funeral was on Saturday. I never really met this cousin and they had a falling out before she and I were together but they used to be close like sisters and were neighbors growing up living on the same street. They saw each other when they couldn't avoid it but generally avoided each other.





On Sunday morning I get a text saying I love you so much, I'm sorry but we need to talk when you get home. I started calling like crazy because that's the worst thing possible you can do IMO sending a message like that. Unfortunately her phone stopped ringing so she must have switched it off. I was worried and panicking most of Sunday and yes my mind jumped to cheating.





So I get home yesterday and she's there and tries to hug me but I pretty much just tell her to say what she needs to say because I was angry she just messaged that to me then went dark. Her cousin died and she was devastated despite their falling out. At the wake on Friday she ends up meeting a family friend and drinking a bit. Then on Saturday after the funeral they end up spending more time together in a group then alone before she had sex with him several times on Saturday night. When she woke up on Sunday it hit her just what she'd done and she freaked out. 




According to her she was devastated, not thinking clearly and just needed something to take her mind off of what happened. She was apparently in a really bad way and wasn't thinking about me or us just then. She's been nothing but apologetic to the point of near groveling since yesterday.




But Idk, I'm devastated, I feel sad because I knew she was always kind of torn up about her falling out with her cousin but this doesn't excuse her hopping into bed to grief fuck away her emotional pain. I mean jesus christ we've been together 6 and a half years, our wedding is in October. And I couldn't even sleep yesterday or last night because I can't stop getting enraged thinking about her being with another man regardless of the reason.




I looked at her this morning and felt nothing except intense sadness and disgust. She tried hugging me and I just left and went for a drive. I took the day off today and I'm regretting that because I'm just at home now with this shit playing through my mind. 



TL;DR Fiance of 6 1/2 years grief cheated on me with another guy while I was working away after her cousin's funeral




**UPDATE/EDIT**: I did not read through every single comment yesterday. However the ones I did read were enough for me to do some thinking last night and realize that I likely won't ever be able to get past this. It would take a truly herculean effort for me to forgive her and move past this and there is every chance in the world that I might just believe I meant it when I forgave her but the pain from her cheating would remain and then reopen like an old wound at a later date.




There's also the whole trust issue thing - I travel for work quite a bit, at least once every two months and at this point I don't know that I'll be able to travel with the peace of mind I used to have before this weekend. I was cheated on in the past and I feel like anytime I get on a plane now I'm going to be worried she's off fucking some other man. I realize this weekend was a complete one off, I know some people may not believe that or agree with it but I know her better than most.



I really do believe her when she said it was a terrible mistake and she wouldn't do it again. I still love her immensely.  **But I wasn't worth being faithful to after 6 and a half years together so she's not worth giving a second chance.** It would be a massive and foolish risk on my part. All she needs to do is be forgiven. I'm the one who would have to work through the pain of being cheated on, the task of trying to forgive her and making sure that I mean it and ultimately going through the extremely painful task of learning to trust her again. So I'm done, as much as that hurts to even begin thinking about and despite the fact that I still love her.",relationship_advice
TIFU by buying my mom an Amazon device.,"I want to start by giving some background here. I basically live, eat, sleep and breath Amazon. I need something, straight to Amazon. I use kindle and audible daily. Want to stream music, Amazon music. Want a new movie, prime video. Run out of something randomly, ""Hey Alexa......."" Laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. Amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. So when looking for a place to store photos, I see ""prime members have free unlimited photo storage with Amazon photos"". Naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. Automatically upload photos from my phone? Even better. 

Rewind to September 25th, my mom's birthday. I thought about her gift for a while, but when I remembered she didn't have a smart TV, the answer was easy. I hop on Amazon shopping and use my Amazon credit card to purchase one FireTV stick. She was so happy she could watch Netflix on her TV now. Yay, success! Or so I thought. 

Yesterday I get an email from Amazon with the subject line ""welcome to the Fire TV family"" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! Not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did I imagine that it would sign in to my Amazon account without even asking for a password. Surely she'd have to use her own account. 

Fast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. Eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. Sitting in my mother's kitchen, I glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65"" photo of my vagina. 

I spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. I happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. I'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. I took probably 40 pictures that night for my SO to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my ENTIRE FAMILY to view. I have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. 

Nobody helped me. The remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where I'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. I didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, I just ran away. 

The worst part, I asked Alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand ""sorry, I'm not sure about that."" Fuck Amazon.

Update: I promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. I talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. However, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. 

I'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an Amazon ad, I just wrote it how I wrote it because I thought it was funny. I wish Amazon was paying me for this crap. 

I'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. Yes I fucked up, I was a dumbass, that's why I posted it here. Yes, I should have known this could happen. Call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my SO do. It's fun. I don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. It happened.

AITA for flipping out on my boyfriend for eating my cake?,"My birthday was this past Monday, and my parents got me a cake for it, naturally. I'm originally from Michigan but go to school in Texas, and as a surprise my parents mailed me something called a 'bumpy cake'. They were like my favorite thing when I was little and I'm not sure if they're ONLY available in Michigan but I definitely can't get them in Texas. 

My boyfriend and I each had a slice of the cake, and then put it in the fridge. When I got back from work the next day I was super excited to eat more of it, only to find that not only was pretty much all of it gone, but it was butchered in a way that suggested it had just been eaten out of the box with a fork. 

I went into the bedroom where my boyfriend was and showed him the cake box. He laughed and said something along the lines of ""I couldn't help it!"" I called him a selfish asshole and told him I couldn't believe he felt so entitled to something that didn't belong to him. 

He seemed really shocked and upset and said he didn't think it would be such a big deal. He started apologizing profusely and said he'd get me another cake but I was so upset with him I just left. I came back a little while later and he had gone from sympathetic to angry. He said he couldn't believe I was so mad at him over a ""stupid fucking cake"" and he ended up storming out. 

I realize it seems stupid and I might have overreacted, but I still think it was completely out of line for him to do that. I've told some friends about the situation and they similarly thought I was being ridiculous and that I shouldn't have been so mad over cake. 

Am I the asshole?

UPDATE: I've gotten a few messages asking for an update, so I figured I'd post one here. I haven't been able to read every comment, but I've looked at responses from every viewpoint and have taken everything to heart. A lot of you seem to think I'm just really stingy with my cake, but what I articulated to my boyfriend this morning was that I moreso was extremely upset that he felt entitled to what was essentially my birthday present. 

When he came back he had cooled down a lot, and we talked about everything. He apologized for eating all of the cake, and I apologized for losing my temper about it. When we argue we both have a habit of leaving instead of letting the argument escalate. I'm still not sure if this is the right move or not.

AITA forbidding my wife from using my daughters old room,"This has been an ongoing argument between my wife and I, but it resulted in a huge argument today and I'm starting to wonder if I'm in the wrong. I think it's impossible for someone in my position to see my wife's point of view fairly so tell me who's the asshole here. I'm also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it's solely this topic/argument that I'm interested in hearing your judgement on.

So my wife and I have two kids together. But before I met my wife I had a daughter with my now ex-wife. My daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. We haven't said a word to each other in almost a decade and I have no desire to speak with her anyway.

I still own the same house as then and I've pretty much left my daughters room as it was. At first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it's kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? I can't really explain the logic behind it because I don't think there is any. It just doesn't feel right to change her room.

This has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and I have really had. The house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there's my daughters old room. My kids know not to go in there and it's just left there. Occasionally I will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. It's therapeutic in some weird way.

My wife has always wanted to change the room. At first it was because she wanted a study, but I refused and eventually she gave up. 

We're now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. Again I put my foot down and said that wasn't an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.

 She really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. She was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. She was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. She said a lot of things but I think that basically sums it up.

When she said these things I was really hurt. But I've had a few hours to think it over, and I think I might be the unreasonable asshole here. It's not fair to make my kids share a room because I won't let go of the past. It's not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn't my first love.

"[24F] Went through a toxic breakup this morning and ringing in 2019 alone with no friends and terrible home life. Need advice on everything, feeling really lost and depressed","EDIT: Truly did not expect this post to take off like this. I am so overwhelmed (in the best way possible) by the immense outpouring of love and support from each and every one of you around the world. I've read every comment, post, message and am trying to reply to every single one but please know all of you have made my 2019 start on the best note possible and I'm so thankful for all of you. Thank you for your advice, support, love, sharing your stories, kindness to a complete stranger. I love you all ❤️

Hi everyone, long time follower of this sub, first time posting using a throwaway. It's 2 hours short of 2019 and I [24F] haven't felt this alone or sad in a long time. I'm sorry in advance this is so long and kind of all over the place but that's kind of just my life recently. 

Went through a breakup this morning with an on-again, off-again guy [27M] I've been seeing since September. We love each other but have a lot of issues and it's been getting increasingly toxic. We've broken up probably 5+ times and this probably sounds so stupid that I keep taking him back but it's really painful and hurts because he's my best friend. I know I just need to stay away but he always tries to reconnect about a week after we end things saying he loves & misses me and things will change, and they do for a few days, but then he goes back to being really distant and canceling plans and messing with my head and making me feel like shit. My New Years resolution is to stop taking him back and cut him out for good. 

Aside from that, I really feel like I don't have any true friends anymore and I even don't know how I got here. My other best friend is an ex - we have been platonic for almost a year now, dated for 1.5 yrs but have been friends since high school. He asked to stop talking for a while because he felt like he still had feelings for me and I don't; I fully understand and respect that. Beyond that I have other acquaintances, mostly from work, but no one I'm really close with. I know the simple solution here is to make more friends but I can't figure out how. I've gone to bars alone more times than I'm willing to admit, fitness classes, hiking, etc - it usually ends up in more acquaintances or hookups just to not feel lonely for the night. And so I've kind of lost interest in trying new things and putting myself out there. Sometimes I go on dating apps just to feel like I have someone to talk to (my matches). 

Lastly, I live at home with my parents because I work nearby and rent here is just outrageous and it just works out, but they're extremely anti-affectionate and always super negative. We've never celebrated a holiday, birthday, special occasion for no particular reason and they've never really been supportive about anything. Always distilling the idea that I'll never be good enough (at my job, to keep a guy, etc). Over this holiday break I've been cooped up at home with nowhere to go and it's constantly dead eerie quiet 24/7 (they don't speak to each other) and just a horrible atmosphere. They're also extremely overprotective and get upset when I go out and need to know every detail of where I'm going, when I'll be back, etc. They put alerts on all credit card and banking activity and insist on shared accounts and what not. 

I've tried therapy but it's always been really discouraging and unsuccessful, and especially today where everyone's celebrating and seems so happy, I've never felt more alone and hopeless. Just seeking words of encouragement and advice from anyone who has been or are currently in my shoes. Normally it doesn't affect me that much because work is a huge distraction but with all this down time it's really beginning to mess with me. Thank you for reading. ",relationship_advice

HELP- my autistic son's behavioral therapist called CPS over turmeric. Not kidding.,"EDIT: thank you all so much for your feedback. The irony in all of this is that I am a mandated reporter as well which, in a sense, has made me more concerned. Alas, I'm trudging forward with abandon and will be kind and cooperative. I'll be sure to post updates. 


I am in California. I need help and I'm hoping that some of you may have some insight. 
My autistic  6 year old has been with the same ABA (behavioral therapy) company for 4 years and we love them. Several weeks ago, we got a new behavioral therapist who is with my son 4 days a week, 2 of them at our home. I have not been happy with her as she rubbed me the wrong way from the start: harsher that necessary with my son and overall cold and calloused. I spoke to our BCBA (supervisor) and she said the therapist was brand new to the company and that they'd give her further training. 

Today, I get a phone call from our BCBA who tells me that CPS was called over a concern that there was a bottle of supplements (turmeric, to be specific) on the counter that my son allegedly picked up and it concerned her. The therapist never said anything to me about this.  Our BCBA then says that she herself has been to our home many times and is here to back me up in anyway needed and that she has never been concerned about anything in our home. 

Questions: 

1. should I obtain legal council or just move forward and willingly work with CPS knowing that there is no case?  My thought is that this is something frivolous and clearly not neglect, but I honestly have no idea what to expect with this process and want to do what's best for my family. 

2. If I do decide to move forward sans attorney, do I allow them in when they visit? 

3. How much (or little) information do I give during the home visit? 

Any feedback would be much appreciated. This is brand new territory for me and, quite frankly, I'm terrified even though I know that I'm a damn good special needs mother.

The left needs to stop treating the right as their mortal enemies,"I know it doesn't mean much but I'm a lefty myself. And I've stated before that I hate what the left has become and is becoming. And one of the big things about that is this attitude that every person who holds conservative politics is immoral, fundamentally bad, and even evil.

The left has just been talking itself into an absolute frenzy lately and seem to think that say, if one or even multiple right wingers commit violent acts that everyone on the right wing either wishes they'd been the one doing it or condones the act. It should go without saying that this is untrue, just as if a group of communists were to bomb some place that rational reaction wouldn't be to blame the entire left wing movement. But yet they do. They also seem to forget that this isn't just your average low brow Republican, you know the one who sits at home watching fox news and votes straight R's down the board. These are people like nazis and 1488ers and other extreme groups among right wing thought.

But what aggravates me the most about this is the calls for calm. Not because it's something that shouldn't happen, but because it's so damn hypocritical. The left spends almost all it's time making the right wing out to be these mustache twirling super villains cackling to themselves while they plot the downfall of every woman, minority, and child in all of America and then they have the audacity to act like the problem is all from the other side. I'm not saying they are responsible for violence, but I am saying that if the left wants unity and calm, maybe the first place it should look at is in the mirror. It drives me batty what my party has become. I have no love in my heart for the right wing, but god  damn I don't think they are the most evil people to crawl from the earth, all with evil intentions and bad motives for any action they do. And I can guarantee you now that, because I'm saying this, I'm going to be accused of actually being a right winger.

The long and short of it is this: the right wing needs to settle down. Without question. But the left hasn't any high ground to cling to when they too are dolling out every insult they can latch on too. Unity requires us to work together, not for the right wing to just roll over and give the left anything and everything it wants, which is what many seem to think unity is. We work together, not as adversaries. Not that I honestly believe it will get through to many people in my party, but hell I'll at least give it a shot.",unpopularopinion

AITA for being unsympathetic to a trans guy that's mad at being dominated by cis guys on the swim team?,"Using a throwaway. 

So, there's a FtM trans guy at my school, let's call him Don (since I'm watching mad men, lol) who recently came out as trans. He says he isn't transitioning using harmone therapy or anything of the sort to transition. As a girl, he was a pretty good swimmer on the team who did the 100M. He switched over to the male team. The coach casually told him the competition might be a little stiff (not in a harsh or transphobic way, more just 'you might want to be aware/prepare yourself' way). Don nodded along and said that's okay.

But the way he's been acting recently shows he thinks it's anything except fair. Since our swim team is pretty competitive (we're won state just last year), his times for the 100m fell to near the bottom of the pack. And he's been whining about this, calling it unfair and saying he should get a handicap of some sort. 

I disagree with this, partially. I do agree that it's unfair that he has to swim with cis guys as a biological female not undergoing transition. But he decided to join the male team, knowing the competition would be stiff. I know it may be have been triggering for him to stay on the girls team, but it's a trade-off: if he wants to be on the male team, he can hardly expect to be given advantages over other guys. 

One time, after practice when Don was complaining, I civilly shared my opinion. He got offended at this.

It might be purely because of connotation at this point, but i do feel like usually the people calling it that are the dramatic idiots that make mountains out of molehills and theres a reason why even though i cant properly verbalize it. 

Edit: first off, im a girl, not that it matters. Secondly, a lot of people seem to be getting the impression that id actually chew someone out for calling their OWN self harm battle scars. Id never do that i only get annoyed by this enough to bitch and moan about it on the internet

"AITA for telling my friend to fuck off with his 9/11 ""survivors guilt""?","Someone I went to high school with happened to be in New York like 3 days before 9/11 and stayed at an hotel near the World Trade Center.

I got sick of this shit so I called him out for it on Facebook telling him to stop making this about him and to stop seeking attention and sympathy on Facebook.

LPT: Blend dog food and low-sodium chicken broth together and freeze it in a hollow dog toy. It will keep your dog busy and occupied for hours while also providing them a healthier treat.,"Edit: Whoa FP!!! So many people to thank! 

I definitely want to address some of the most popular comments:

A lot of people have brought up the mess factor, in my experience my dog finishes this well before it melts, if your dog is picky or loses interest in challenging tasks quickly this might not be for them or might need to be an outside only treat.

Also, definitely check your chicken broth for onions, many of you have mentioned that they are bad for doggo. My vet recommended this to me and did not mention this as a concern but I will definitely be taking this into consideration. 

Kong balls/bones work best as they are very difficult for your dog to destroy. 

TL;DR: might be best to give to dogs outside; onions are bad and in broth; Kong Balls are where it's at!",LifeProTips

TIFU by jerking off and forgetting my PetCam was faced directly at me,"So I want to just say this is 100% true and 100% embarrassing. 


So I usually have Monday's off and spend the day doing homework, tidying up, playing video games, and today... jerking off. I don't usually feel inclined to do this however today I had the urge. It was about an hour before my girlfriend got home so I definitely had time. I go into my room and get into bed and start skimming thru Ol' Faithful AKA Pornhub. 

I finally find a video worth B'ing my L to and get down to business. As I'm about to... ya know... I get an alert on my phone that my girlfriend had just accessed the PetCam we have in our room that's on our dresser. (We got this PetCube camera for Christmas so we can watch our two dogs while we are at work/school/out.) I immediately stop, now knowing that my girlfriend just witnessed me jerking it mid-Monday so I text her ""........"" . She doesn't answer for about 2 minutes and then I see that she's calling me. 

Now we've been together 2.5 years so this isn't like a make or break thing and I honestly thought that although it was slightly embarrassing, it was also pretty funny. So I answer the phone laughing, ready for this to be something we joke about for a long time to come. Unfortunately, I was sadly mistaken to this being ""funny"". She tells me that her co-workers had asked about our dogs and she wanted to show them on our awesome PetCam! But instead of two cute dogs on our bed, it was just me with my shorts down at my ankles, going to town on myself! So needless to say I don't think I'll be invited to any of her work Christmas parties in the future.

TL;DR : Decided to crank it before my girlfriend got home and forgot my PetCam was faced directly at me. She wanted to show her co-workers our dogs and instead showed them me jerking it in our bed.

Edit: lmao just some clarification... she's shown coworkers before because they love our dogs and ask to see them because it's ""cute"" to see them live and sleeping. Also, in her defense, I told her I was doing homework and what not so the last thing to cross her mind was me yankin it probably. Also the cam is tucked in the corner so I forget it's even there most the time. (B'ing my L = blowing my load)

Edit 2 (last one) : for everyone saying ""why would you have a PetCam facing your bed?"" That's where our dogs are 90% of the time. When we are out of the house, that's where we leave them. When we are home, that's mostly where they want to be unless we're on the couch with them. Don't you think we put the camera there..... for a reason? Lol and btw, my gf and I are fine! She was freaked out about it at first but now it's already funny. That's why I love her so much lol so take it easy on her, we both fucked up!


LAST AND FINAL EDIT:

Not that i need to prove anything but this is for people asking to see them. (It's a Great Dane and Am-Staff btw)

AITA for making my boyfriend believe our cat ran away?,"We are both 24 and have lived together for 2 years in my apartment. For my birthday last year and he got me a cat for us to share which he named Lucy. I thought it was a cute name and I took care of her so well and love her very much. Last week we were having sex and he moans out Lucy's name. I ask him why he is moaning our cats name and he says it was just an accident. I ask some of his friends if he knows anyone names Lucy and discover that is a coworker of his that I didn't know he had. I talk to her and find out they have been cheating for the whole time we've had the cat. He literally got me a cat and named it after her so he would have an alibi if he accidentally said her name. I told her that he was my boyfriend and she didn't believe me so I showed her some pictures of us together and she started crying saying that she didn't know he was dating anyone. I told her that I was sorry and that it wasn't her fault but I'm glad we found this out. I kick my boyfriend out for cheating and he moves in with his brother. He tries to take the cat that he gave me. I don't feel that he should get the pet since he didn't buy it out of love but only as a cover for his cheating and I've been the one taking Lucy to all her vet checkups and buying all her food and toys and everything. I convinced him that the cat ran away and he's upset with me for that but I don't really care because I'm done with him and I don't feel he deserves to keep the cat that he gave me and never really took care of. AITA?

Edit: I'll try and answer the most common questions. 
- I don't think he planned to moan the cats name during sex, he has called me Lucy before in casual conversation and I didn't think anything of it because of the cat. 
- I did try to tell him the cat was a gift but he started spamming me with messages and since he knows where I live and work I didn't want him to start stalking me since he was showing signs of that. Once I told him the cat ran away he got mad and now doesn't want to talk to me anymore since it's my fault I lost the cat. So now I can just take care of my cat without worrying about him showing up unannounced 
- yes I am renaming the cat, one of the comments suggested Lucky and that will be her new name. :-)",AmItheAsshole

AITA for blowing up at my husband's brother for how he declined donating sperm to us?,"**I want to make it very clear that this isn't about him saying no, it's about how he declined. If he'd just said no, this wouldn't be a conversation.**

My husband and I have been trying for kids for a while. He, as it turns out, has azoospermia, which is no sperm. We've been taking about donors, and he's only comfortable with it if it comes from his brother. Adoption isn't something we could possibly afford right now, and I don't love the idea of a 3rd party getting to call all the shots about us having children. Eric has donated before in college and currently has a son with a girlfriend. He's a little smarmy and self important, but not a bad person. So we asked him, and now I have regrets. 

He sent a very detailed email in which he went into excruciating detail of all the reasons he felt we wouldn't be good parents, and what we'd ""need to change"" before he would ""give us"" a child. At the risk of making this post as long as the email itself, there were two main points. 

1. He didn't feel that our income was high enough. He demanded to see financial records. He wanted to see his brother more advanced/settled in a career, and wanted to know my career trajectory as well. Both of us have been in the same companies for 5+ years, and don't have dead end jobs. He also wanted us in a house and not an apartment. 

2. He felt that I and his brother needed to get therapy for ""being different"". Along this line, he wanted his brother to ""act more normal"". We would also need to convert and follow their family's religion and ""not be a heathen"". 

I was furious when I received this. HE COULD HAVE JUST SAID NO. That he acted like the sole way for us to have children and like he could control our lives is ridiculous. I don't want to adopt BECAUSE I don't want to have a third party telling me what my standards are. I'd rather be childless. I called him, screamed at him for the horrifying email, and said I wouldn't want his goods if he was the last person on earth.

TIFU by taking my 3-year old daughter into the men's room,"I'm a dad of a beautiful 3 year old girl.  Any dad of a daughter will tell you that bathroom stuff is part of the deal.  If mom is not around, or tending to one of the others, I have to take my little girl into the men's room.  So this happened at a quiet little mom & pop restaurant.  It was just the two of us in there.  I wipe off and cover the seat so she can do her little tinkle...but then I realize I really have to go.  No big deal.  I just place her in the corner of the stall and say ""don't move.""
I start to pee.

I hear the door to the restroom open, meaning we are now no longer the only two occupants.  I hear two guys walk in.  As one of the sets of footsteps draw near, my little girl starts to back away from the door and ends up right next to me.  She looks down at what's going on (with an ""open door"" policy on the bathroom at home, and her two brothers...it's nothing she hasn't seen before) and loudly exclaims:  ""Daddy!!  Look at your little penis!!""

What...the...

I hear the other guys in the bathroom kind of snort...and then let loose in laughter.

First of all...wow.  She's never said that before...or since.  Second...WHAT IS HERE FRAME OF REFERENCE!!??  

I didn't know what I could possibly say to make it any better.  I kind of wanted to yell out ""Um..She's just kidding...it's normal size""  but I figured that any remark trying to clarify my size would just come off as creepy.  I just stayed in the stall until the other two guys left.  I couldn't face them.  I'm sure they were out there in the restaurant watching to see me come out so they could tell their wives about the guy who has a tiny wiener by three year old standards!!

I am at my wits end, what can I do to stop it?","**edit2: putting this here since this is locked. Thank everyone for all the advice/support. I will be following some of the advice recieved and update once I have one. If this works I'll be able to stay though an overwhelming amount of what I've been told leads to me accepting that there is a 60% chance I'll have no choice but to move. Thanks expecially to all the  orthodox people who have reached out with practical advice and information about this group and how it works. That has been expecially helpful because it's put my situation into perspective. Yeah it sucks but worst case I can move across down the block or something  and be rid of it which isn't the case for people within the community. And even though the NYPD has been helpless from my perspective, they have always responded to my calls and made the group stop in that moment, which again, is not an option for people within the community. Hearing from people on the other end has really helped accept the situation i've Found myself in for what it is. Will update when I can.**


*Edit: since i am geting this a lot, to clarify: my building has cameras. the police have seen the footage. the police have responded to them harassing me and are fully aware of what is going on.  it hasn't helped. most of the time (today included) i have to call the nypd in order to get them to move and stop preventing my guests from coming in the building or to stop harassing me in that moment. they come, tell them to stop, then leave and they just do it again. today the nypd came to my home SEVEN times. and this is common.*

I live in Brooklyn NY. I purchased a condo about 2 years ago in a building where a good chunk of the apartments are rented out by Orthodox families. i would say that 45% of the building is occupied by Orthodox families renting and the rest are condos owned + occupied by non orthodox people. I honestly did not care and did not think this would be a problem.

Since i moved in though, this has been a HUGE issue. I don't want to go into to much detail since it would just lead to a rant but the families in by building do not like/agree with my ""lifestyle"" and have been trying to make me uncomfortable enough to force me to move out. I honestly don't give two shits about their opinions and typically try my best to ignore them. The issue is that they have been using the Jewish police to harass me. 
To give you an idea of the shit I am dealing with I'll tell you what prompted this post.  I chose to have a Superbowl viewing party today. About 30 minutes into the start of the party (when there were FIVE people here) I get a knock at my door and standing there are two fake police who try to tell me they got a 'noise complaint' and a complaint that we are using 'illicit substances' that i have to end my party. We were in my yard at this point literately just talking and smoking (cigs). My condo is on the ground floor and people who live above me can see directly into the yard so i am assuming they are who claimed the cigs were drugs.   Since then, they have been standing outside of my building trying to prevent people I INVITED from entering and have been harassing my guess, treating to ticket them and demanding to search them. I don't want to make this post too long but this is the smallest of the shit that I have had to deal with from these fake police over the last two years. 

I am fucking done. I want this to stop. I have tried everything i can think of and dont know what else to do. I have tried calling the NYPD every time they show up. This has not worked. I have complained to my condo association. No help. I have contacted my elected officials, filed complaints with the city AND state, contacted the fair housing justice center to file a discrimination complaint, and NOTHING has worked. I keep being told that what they are doing is not illegal and that they have permission to impersonate (my word) the police and attempt to enforce (their version) of the law. 

at one point, i was gone for a week and my boyfriend was harassed for 'trespassing' for going into the home THAT I OWN WITH MY PERMISSION. 

Im sorry that this is such a long run on rant. I am just so fed up with this bullshit. I am being discriminated against and harrassed by fake police who are trying to bully me into moving out of a HOME I OWN on behalf of a bunch of people who dont even pay market rent to live in my building because they cant stand to live with a gay person and everyone is telling me this is legal.

AITA for playing a big prank on my religious cousins?,"I'm in a...not good situation right now. My mom is having some personal issue, and she's making me (15M) stay with my cousins in Tennessee for a few months. They (aunt, uncle, son (14M), daughter (11F)) are very Christian and superstitious. They believe in casting out demons, and they anoint us with oil and don't allow any video games or modern tv. They think it will let evil into the house. They drag me to church two times a week, and it's like a weird one where they speak in tongues. I don't want to disrespect their beliefs, but it's really not my kind of thing. 

I really enjoy reading fantasy books, and I liked watching those kind of movies too before I moved here. Yesterday, my aunt found out I had a copy of City of Bones and a few other books like that, and she lost her shit. She burned them in this fire pit thing they have, and now she want to do regular inspections of my room. 

I was obviously pissed, so after she went to bed, I took ketchup from the fridge and drew a pentagram on the bathroom mirror (supposed to look like blood lmao). I also wrote names of random demons I knew around it, along with the phrase ""we will eat your soul."" 

Needless to say, they lost their minds. And they called my other aunt to come get me. My aunt hadn't said a word to me, and she's anointing every doorway in their place. My uncle made me wipe it off and he called me some not very Christian words. 

AITA for doing the prank?

Edit: for the people saying that my mom is an asshole for leaving me...she didn't really have a choice. My mom is in rehab right now unfortunately. If she didn't go she would have to serve time.

Last edit: to update you all, I'm hopefully staying with my other aunt until my mom gets back. Thanks to all the people who offered to replace my books— I appreciate you all. I only had five in total burned though, and my aunt is working on getting my religious aunt to give me money to replace them.

TIFU by sexually harassing a 9 year old boy,"TIFU, and it actually happened today. I was driving with my 12 year old daughter. We got caught at a red light next to a restaurant. I glanced at the restaurant and saw a kid walking in the parking lot by himself. It looked like my daughter's friend Gabe. I said to her, ""is that..."" and before I could even finish, she said yes. 

So I suggested we say hi to him. I rolled down my window and screamed ""Gabe!"" The kid turned around, and that's when I realized it wasn't Gabe. It was a younger boy, maybe 9 years old. 

So here's the thing. This kid isn't Gabe. God only knows if he's even heard the name Gabe before. And it's a busy intersection, so it's noisy. 

The kid had such a puzzled and embarrassed look on his face, and he ran to his car. And that's when I realized, this 9 year old kid thinks a middle aged woman just rolled down her car window, screamed ""gay!!!"" at him, and drove away. My daughter laughed her ass off at me.

AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?,"Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.

Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?

My Mom: Nothing.

A long ass pause.

Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.

So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.

The conversation ended with this:

Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

So I say my part before leaving.

Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.

My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

Me: No.

My mom: But [me], we really need the money...

Me: That's too bad.

I get up and go off to my room.

So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""

My mom, who's listening in.

""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""

Me: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.

My mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.

That was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.

TIFU by breaking both my arms whilst riding a bike I'm not allowed to ride,"I'm a  backpacker travelling around South America on a miniscule budget, jobbing my way around. I've been working in a hotel in the Colca canyon, Peru. My boss splits his time between the hotel and his family home in Arequipa (a city 5 hours away).

We have mountain bikes for hire at the hotel (STRICTLY FOR GUESTS) and I'd taken to sneaking rides on the bikes when my boss is away.

Anyway, I took one of the bikes out in the morning and rode 45 minutes to the next town over. Glorious day, no problems, having a great time. On my back, I'm getting up a bit of speed (it's mostly downhill) when suddenly I hit an improvised speed bump made of rocks outside of a rural orphanage that wasn't there earlier in the morning. I go flying over the handlebars and into the road, breaking both of my arms and completely mangling the bike. 

8 hours and a $1300 ambulance ride to Arequipa later, I have to ring my boss and ask him to drive the 10 hour round trip to collect my stuff from his hotel and bring it to me in hospital. I also have to explain that I destroyed one of his bikes.

I am currently holed up in a hotel room in Arequipa waiting for my shitty insurance to organise a flight back to England. I can get dressed and type but, crucially, I can't wipe my arse. I was also supposed to move on to Chile for another 2.5 months tomorrow in preparation for a glorious Christmas return.

Bonus detail: The only reason that I rode to the town in question was to ask out a girl in a coffee shop who turned out to have a husband anyway.

I crippled myself while disobediently riding/destroying a bicycle owned by my boss and I'd have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling kids.

I notice that my acquaintances and friends who tend to be very accomplished people, and are the epitome of the successful man tended to be some of the realest and most genuine people around me. For example the traits they shared would be: athletic accomplishments in sports, lifting, strong career and academic goals, involvement in clubs and student activities (both in HS and college), traveling, open mindedness, self created good appearance (due to taking care of self and clothing), and humble/positive personalities. I've had lab mates who went to Oxford and Harvard who I wouldn't have even suspected gone to such schools, because when you talk to them,  they wanted to know about you and really laid back people. You know they're awesome people from just the way they carry themselves.

I had former friends and acquaintances who were the opposite. For example one example of a former close I had was somebody who barely got through high school and participated in nothing back then. After, he would be extremely stubborn about getting a job, going to a job training program, or putting himself in positions to meet new people, ect. His ass was just sitting around broke and always creating drama with other people, while mooching off others. He did not work out much, yet bragged constantly about his childhood accomplishments, claiming to have played 10 different sports. He always talked about being alpha and tried to act like the top dog around others.

TIFU by hiding in my girlfriend's room while her parents are home,"As the title says, I am currently fucking up by being in my girlfriend's room. 

You may be thinking she's here with me, scared to be caught, but she's not. In fact she's nowhere near me, because she's at school.

My girlfriend and I live about an hour away from each other and she has school so you can imagine seeing each other is not the easier thing right away. My girlfriend also lives with her parents, and she's Asian, meaning no boyfriend until college (though her mom seems okay with it).

On Wednesday we developed a plan to have me sleepover her house without getting caught. The plan was simple, I would come when her parents were gone at work (they own a restaurant) and I would leave in the morning when her dad takes her to school because her mom would still be sleeping.

It went great, I made it out, even ran to my car which wasn't necessary because by the time her dad was coming back I was driving out of her neighbourhood. 

Fast forward to that night and I end up going back over. Thursday goes good, I go to her room in the morning and end up going back to sleep until she comes home. 

Now it's Friday morning. Her dad almost caught us because he wanted to take the recycling out but she quickly got it for him. Then she leaves, I lock her bedroom door and settle in her bed where I'll be for the next 7 hours waiting for her to come back. 

Her dad comes back, comes upstairs, tries to open the door. Fuck. It's locked. He pauses, turns the light on, I assume he looks in her brother's room, then tries the door again. Still locked for obvious reasons he does not know about. He says something to himself (I don't speak Chinese but I really wish I did), then goes back downstairs where he sleeps on the couch.

I text girlfriend, almost dying because of how scared I am to get caught. She tells me to chill, tells me they don't have keys to their doors, the only way to open it is to take the handle off. She texts her dad, saying the doors locked and she can unlock it later, he says okay. Her dad doesn't always listen so that worries me.

Pretty sure her dad went back to sleep now, and her mom isn't awake. Now I'm currently laying in her bed wide awake, texting her, asking my parents what to do (have had similar experiences and got caught), and trying not to freak the fuck out because I can't do anything.

Escaping is impossible. Her window has blinds and a screen and is second story. Going downstairs and out the door is foolish, her dad sleeps on the couch and the stairs are noisy. Plus I have no idea what time her mom wakes up.

I have no choice but to sit it out for the next 7 hours, maybe try to get some rest but I doubt I will. Anyone have any advice? She's 19, I'm 20, her parents don't even know she has a boyfriend.

I imagine they'll be beyond pissed if they find out I'm here, we'll both be fucked. Not only is she dating me but I'm staying in her house without them knowing. It's scary to think there could be someone in your house and you wouldn't even know it, I feel bad for doing this but I love my girlfriend and I'm literal melted butter in her hands.

Update: probably should have gotten up with her right away but chose to stay in bed... now I have to poop really badly. About 6 more hours to go though. Rip my bowels and my asshole. Also for some reason everything in her house fucking creaks, so I have to be very careful with what I do on the bed, sleeping position wise.

Update 09:54 am, about 5 more hours: I still have to poop, not as badly though. However a new probably has arose. I grabbed a hard boiled egg earlier when her dad was gone, two baby oranges, and a piece of Hawaiian bread. I ate the egg obviously because I can't really eat all day, and most of one of the baby oranges, and two bites off the little square of bread. Tummy feels a bit weird. Hope I don't throw up because it's very hard to be silent while your guts spill on the floor. Also think of napping but too afraid I'll let out a massive fart or make some noise. Girlfriend stopped replying due to class. I've given up the idea of escaping a long while ago. The dad is of no concern, pretty mid level threat but low for now. Mom is high level once she wakes up though. Hopefully she'll leave for work but it looks like that might not happen as she isn't awake yet and supposedly would leave at 10:30. 

Quick update 09:55am: mom is awake and went downstairs, I think she'll make breakfast or something. Dad is talking to mom, don't know what about. Hope they don't try the door again, really feel like I'm gonna shit and throw up now.

Good update 10:03 am: good news, pretty sure the mom just left, pretty sure I can hear her dad snoring. I can finally relax a little. Might actually catch some shut eye. Off to play a bit of fifa mobile and then maybe sleep for a few hours.

Okay another update since it was asked for: 10:20 am, mom's long gone for sure, dad's asleep, not snoring but I'm pretty sure he's sleeping. Unfortunately girlfriend hasn't answered texts for the last two hours I think. Finally beat a team in fifa after playing them for the 20th time. Every time the air conditioner turns on it makes this loud ass noise so every time that happens I get spooked. I'm glad everyone is getting a good laugh out of it. Someone thought this post was fake, which is fine. Not really sure how to prove it's real. As I said before hiding under the bed is impossible, the only place to hide is her closet which will be a tight squeeze. Hoping it doesn't come to that. Dad will probably sleep all day, as he stays up all night talking to his friends in China so his body is in another time zone. Might just nap when the girlfriend comes home as she usually naps after class. Thanks for the good luck. See you in an hour or when something interesting happens. 

Updated 11:40 am: hello, my girlfriend knows this exists now so hello, enjoy my pain and these comments. So far dad's still asleep, mom is at work, AC still spooks me. Here's some answers to questions: gf's birthday is late, yes dad works but ""he can't handle work"" so he goes later (around 6 I think?), and I'll make it clear now I'm not planning to escape, it would be stupid. I truly think gf's dad doesn't care enough to try and bust down the door. Also yes, Florida is a Stand Your Ground are but dad doesn't own guns, just knives (I feel like I could run faster, used to play soccer and have been practicing boxing for years and more recently muay thai so I know how to run and fight). To those asking for proof, if you tell me how to upload a pic then I'd have no problem doing that. As for my poop situation, I still have to go but it's not that bad anymore. Yes I have a bit or orange and bread left, and I have headphones that are supplying me with some nice Spotify service. Also, I played campaign mode in fifa, finally beat chapter 2 after 3 days. See you in an hour. 

Not really an update but I'll post link to gf and I'd texts and her room door (had to reupload bc her face was exposed) [proof reddit](https://imgur.com/gallery/9Pv91je) 

Update AGAIN: uhhhhh I didn't see a post that got deleted. I deleted the link to the pic bc it had her face in it, but I uploaded a new pic and posted the link up above. If this shit is deleted then uhhhh what the fuck reddit you wanna fight? As for my bowels, still gotta go but not as badly. I'm probably going to watch some YouTube or Netflix, since sleeping isn't a good idea. I'll update in an hour as always. 

UPDATE: try using your phone to view. Anyway GOOD NEWS. As we speak I am shitting in the toilet. Dad left. Pooping has never felt so good. I'll update you when my girlfriend comes back.

Update: girlfriend is home, I pooped as soon as the dad left. Yes I know it's stupid staying longer but now that my girlfriend is home I'm safe. For those who are asking why didn't I leave when I got the food, there was a very tiny window to do things, and I didn't have my bag packed. There will be one more update after this when I get home, the true safe zone. As for now the girlfriend and I are going to play fifa and chill until I have to leave. 

FINAL UPDATE: hello I am at my house in bed, nowhere near my girlfriend's parents. I have pooped twice, it went well thank you for asking. About my girlfriend's age,,, she went to school in China at first, and has a late birthday, therefore she's making up credits and will be going to actual uni soon. She's not finished university and gotten a degree, therefore, NO BOYFRIEND. For those of you saying she's an adult her parents don't control her... they do. As long as she lives there and they support her financially. Not to mention she isn't white... She's Asian (Chinese specifically). I myself am Italian/Cuban, so the same rules go for me until I move out (planning to before the end of next year).  Many of you ask why I didn't leave when her dad left to pick her up, instead pooping. First off I had to poop so badly. Secondly I won't see her for awhile, and recently she got hurt so I've been helping tend to her wounds so she doesn't need to go to the hospital (mom's a nurse, taught me everything since I was young). I wanted to be there for her in person. Also yes, her parents own a restaurant. I won't post anymore updates (99.9% chance I won't bc it's over) but will reply to DM's and replies :)

Final permanent update: yes it's about almost a year later, she broke up with me a few months ago. I'm glad you all enjoyed my pain lmao just wanted to write this just in case anyone comes back to read this and is wondering what happened almost a year later. I'm currently happy, perhaps have a bit of a thing going on with a different girl, I'm mentally and physically better than when I did this stupid shit. I will never do this again, and I don't suggest anyone else does it, I had about 5 heart attacks throughout the whole thing and it was a shitty thing to do, if I was the dad and found out I would be beyond pissed. Sorry Mr.Ex's Dad. Yeah, I hope everyone is doing well, I'm doing better, enjoy your day/night :)

Please reach out to that person and let them know you care. I've been on that end and it is so reassuring to hear from someone even if you don't feel like being around anyone.

"I believe it should be illegal, with very limited exceptions, to fire someone for something they said or did outside of the workplace.","I am so glad I found this forum, as I think I have something to contribute!  This always gets downvoted when I'm arguing elsewhere so I think it would fit in here.

Lately there's been a whole lot of posts on Reddit, and elsewhere, where ""oh look this guy said the N word on Twitter and a bunch of people called up his work and he got fired, let's all laugh nazi tears QQ!""  No matter how despicable someone's views are, something about this, and the celebration of it, doesn't sit right with me.

This isn't so much about trying to protect people that say racist shit on Twitter.  This is about workplace protections for employees, how much of bullshit ""at-will employment"" really is, and wanting to see all employees essentially carry what amount to union protections currently.

I work in a job that has these protections.  Trust me, there are many things you can do that will get you fired, and there are some things that you can do outside the workplace that will still get you fired.  Thing is, that list is very clear-cut with little if any wiggle room.

Did you commit a felony?  Yeah, you're gone regardless of when or where.

Did you commit a misdemeanor, but it was something related to your line of work?  Yeah, that's enough to fire.  Like...if you're an accountant but you get busted for fraud, or retail and you were caught shoplifting from Kohl's or something.  Because it's specifically related to your daily duties it's enough to let go of someone.

But beyond that, you're not going to get fired.  Did you get in a fight with some guy at a bar over the weekend and get locked up?  Okay, you'll get called an idiot, but you're not going to face disclipline at work over it (nor should you.)

There's also a very clear-cut social media policy.  If it's on a forum that's run by the employer, they can discipline you based on what you said.  If it's on the internet anywhere, but you did it from a company device, or on company time, they can nail you.  But outside of work, outside of the employer's forum, and off of company-issued devices?  Nope, you can't be touched for it (unless it breaks one of the above felony/misdemeanor rules, which is usually pretty hard to do on social media.)

""But what about fields that hold someone to a higher standard, like lawyers or doctors or police?  They'd look horrible if they had to continue to employ someone that went on some bigoted rant!""

And I get that, which is why the employer should get some outs - but nothing as easy as ""oh, we just get to say you don't work here any more because we feel like it and you made us look bad.""  We're giving way too much power to SJWs and internet mobs by allowing for doxxing to have an instant life-ruin effect on someone, even if the person is an asshole.

Morality clauses in contracts are fine in some cases - but NOT as a ""you agree to this to get the job.""  It should run more like ""okay, we're paying you $x/hour for your normal time, and an additional smaller $x/hour, ABOVE your standard salary, as an expectation that you are still 'on the clock' and will not do anything that would bring us into disrepute.""  Alternatively, if a company doesn't want to go that route, and wants to do it on a reactionary basis, a severance clause could come into play.  Something that says ""Okay, we don't want you here, but you haven't done anything or done enough at work for us to have a reason to fire you, so we want out.  So we're going to pay you $XXX,XXX, which will be enough for you to get yourself situated in another job, or move to another location.""  Whether it be upfront saying ""we expect more and we'll pay for it"" or after the fact, regardless of which it should NOT BE FREE for an employer to fire someone unless workplace misconduct or one of the above rules about criminal acts can be proven.

If the job in question is one of those high-profile jobs where there's millions of dollars to be lost from a PR fiasco, these are exactly the jobs where they should be able to cut a six-figure check to have someone leave and still be able to turn to the people complaining about whatever the idiot said on social media and say ""They don't work here any more.  Are you happy now?""

On a similar note, if someone is under a contract to produce work, and the contract doesn't have a per-hour morals clause, and the employer wants to sever ties, they should have to pay out as if the person under contract completed all work on the contract.  To have an easy example, Roseanne Barr should have been paid for all remaining episodes/seasons under contract even though her series was cancelled.

Right now it's really easy for people to be okay with swarms to get people fired who say really reprehensible things, because those swarms are going after the ""right"" people.  (After all, beholdthemasterrace IS doxxing, or doing the bare minimum to appear like they're not, but they DO dox, and the sub should be banned for it, but it won't because who's going to go against the people that are pointing out figurative and sometimes literal Nazis?)  It's easy now.  But let's look at another extreme that's constantly in Reddit news.  China's new Social Credit system.  Oh, you play video games too much, or you get caught littering or smoking?  We're revoking your right to hold certain jobs, or rent luxury hotels, or fly first-class, or even get a plane ticket at all.  By being okay with firing people for off-work behavior, that sets a precedent that you're never truly separated from your employer.  And eventually that line's going to move, and it's going to result in decisions that aren't as easy.  It's not going to go from ""let's get racists fired"" to ""let's control every aspect of someone's life for the sake of the country/employer"" like China is doing overnight, but gradually I could see where we could end up having someone get axed from a job because they posted about drinking too much, or posted a clip of them shouting ""get fucked"" when they kill someone in Call of Duty or something that is currently considered pretty mundane.

That's why I want to see laws that protect workers similar to what Europe has, for everyone in the US.  It might protect a few assholes, but it'll probably protect way more people who aren't assholes later on.

AITA for not caring about my wife's injury.,"so my wife (26f) and her friends decided to do a 4 day Vegas holiday, she saved up heaps of money to blow on the poker machines and picked out some super sexy outfits. 

I'm 27m

3 days into the trip her and her friends decided to drive drunk and they managed to get themselves into an accident, all 4 of them where extremely over the limit and it looks like my wife's friend might be getting jail time. (she was the driver)

they wanted to drive to this new bar that had opened. 

my wife's court date is soon 

she managed to break her leg and has been relying on crutches to get around.

"This morning I (27M) found out my gf (27F) cheated on me, where to go from here?","So our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but I asked my boss if I could come in late as I had some stuff I had to do. However I went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. She gave me a key to her apartment and when I went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




As soon as I walked in she saw me and burst into tears. The guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. I freaked out at first and the guy left. She kept asking what are you doing here, I thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. I tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. Eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



I took the flowers and the gift and left. I'm sitting at work right now because if I went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





We've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. I was looking up rings. She said it's because I was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. She thought I wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. I asked if there were any others but she said no. Idk what to believe at this point. 




The kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. We had lunch and got a hotel room together. We had dinner at my place with my folks and I dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. I trusted her for fucks sake.




 How and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? What am I supposed to do from here?



TL;DR spent valentines day morning learning my girlfriend is a cheater and the details of that cheating, sitting at work staring at my screen 




*edit at roughly 1:30PM. : I broke up with her, I told her I'll be by later to get my shit and to have it ready. I'll be taking her stuff over and giving her back her key.*

TIFU by honey dicking my wife after she found my used condoms...NSFW,"Well brethren, I too wanted to partake in the great Coconutting frenzy. Today was my day off and was also my wifes longest day of work. It should be mentioned shes on her period, and sex is out of the picture for her. I havent busted a nut in roughly 4 days, and the idea of penetrating a milky coconut somehow thrilled me after reading the whole coconut-fucking-bonanza today.

I went to the store, got a coconut and a bottle of wine to set the mood. After getting home, I uncorked the wine to get my buzz on and proceeded to open the coconut via hammer and nail. Once the hole was set into place, I expanded it apropriately to fit my member by using some of the untensils int he kitchen. Once I got a good fit after doing a ""test run"" I found the hairs to be a little too much. I shaved her in the bathroom using my wahl clippers. The preparations were made, the mood was set, and I opened up a pack of condoms and went to work on my new bitch.

Fast foward a few hours later, and my wife comes home. All is well, we ate dinner and talked, usual bullshit. I knew I fucked up when she confronted me with the condom wrappers I had used. Aparently she found them in the trash can and freaked the fuck out asking who was over.. I told her I cheated on her with a coconut. .. It took a lot of convincing and showing of reddit threads to prove I didn't have anyone else over and I simply needed a good couple of fap sessions alone. She was furious and I tried to console her by saying I'd never cheat on her with anyone..Just was having a hard time due to her time of the month and it seemed like a good idea. I'm not allowed to buy cocounuts anymore :/

TL;DR : Fucked my coconut with a condom, wife found them thought I was cheating on her, had to fess up.

Also, I'm French, so my English is average at best.

We lost our 14 yo daughter to cancer( I don't want to discuss that here ) a couple of years ago. These two years have been very difficult for us. Though I've learned to cope up, nothing can ever replace her. 

My wife attended a support group, where she ended up befriending another woman, whose 11yo daughter had the same cancer our daughter had and they became close friends. Her daughter survived. We are really happy for her. She and her daughter visit us sometimes. 

Last time, when her daughter was here, she came across my daughter's custom made neclace which I made for her( I'm a jewellery designer by profession ). She saw it in a small room in which we made a small memorial for our daughter. It has her pictures, belongings and all her favourite things. She really liked it and asked my wife about it. 

Now, after they left, my wife asked me if I can make the same one for the girl. My wife told me that the girl really liked the neclace and asked if she could have one. I told her that it was something I made for my daughter and I don't want to share that or make it for anyone. No one can replace her.

AITA for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children,"Saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

A few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

I pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn't even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.

I've always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they're still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn't confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?

Edit- okay I get it I'm an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn't think the triplets had different fathers. I'm not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by using Google Home to convince my kids they weren't getting any presents.," So today I came up with an evil plan to use my Google Home to make the kids be good. I found that you can get the Home to say anything you need using the custom Shortcuts settings from the home app. So I spent a little time perfecting a role play between Google and myself.

Trigger:
""Hey Google, Are any of my children on the bad boys and girls list?""

Response:
""I have just checked with Santa and yes, both Laura and Joel appear on the bb and g list this year.""

After a couple of seconds of shock and confusion. Laura was screaming and Joel slowly sank to the floor bawling in disbelief. It took 5 minutes to convince them that I had played a trick and yes, I was bad dad.

Feel free to try it yourself if you hate your children. The action is 'repeat after me blah blah blah'

I left some volatile gummy bears on the desk now my co-worker wants to sue me,"This is in Michigan. I am originally from Germany and very unsure how the law works in the United States so bear with me. 

Last year I received a job offer to work as an assistant professor in the German language department at a large university in Michigan. I recently finished my PhD and was really excited to fill a research position (and possible post doc position) in the specific field I applied to. 




Most of my time I give classes in German literature but additionally the university would like me to help students with writer's block so I joined an interdisciplinary workshop. 

There are at least 4 people connected to this workshop and we get along fine most of the time. Sadly there is one elderly woman who made me out as a rival day one. 

I do not know what provoked her but there is something about me that makes her mad.  Cue the incident...I had an appointment with a student, gave him some tips and instructions and left my bowl with gummy bears on the desk. 

Mind you, these gummy bears a sugar free and volatile, if you eat more than a handful you are in serious fart troubles and you will occupy the toilet bowl for the rest of your day.

But my co-worker ate the whole bowl, first she excused herself from any commitments and then she called in sick. The next day she confronted me and blamed me for the whole ordeal, that I deliberately placed those gummy bears and it was all a ploy to humiliate her. 

According to her she has already informed HR and her lawyer and that I will be kicked out of the country in no time. The only thing I can blame myself on is that me and my colleagues giggled at her bowel distress signals.

If our only 2 options are an entire lifetime of work or potential death via overexposure in the streets then suicidal ideation is absolutely rational.

AITA for being frustrated that my wife is angry about the sex of our baby?,"My (24m) wife (24f) is 24 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. She made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about ""sending it back"" if it was a boy. The jokes all seemed lighthearted and I just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. Fast forward to our 20 week scan. We go in super excited and nervous. I don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. 

We go in and find out we are having a boy. My wife immediately bursts into tears and I hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. She doesn't stop crying the whole day. I let her calm down and try to comfort her. 

It's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. She refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. Family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. 

Now that it's been nearly a month I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. It's just such an overreaction. I told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. She cried and called me an asshole. I told her she needs to get a grip. I felt awful but I feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous. 

My wife and I made up but she's still acting the same and I'm getting upset again.

TIFU by pranking my Sister-in-law,"My sister-in-law is an absolute technophobe. She has always had some shit mobile phone but recently upgraded to an iPhone due to some pressure from her kids. She was having some problems with certain aspects of it, certain things draining her battery etc and asked me if I could have a look at it. So, me being the absolute evil genius that I am, entered a text shortcut so that when she typed the word 'Jay' (which is her husbands name) it would come up 'you're a fat bitch! Lol jk'. I know this is hardly an imaginative prank, and an infantile text, she would try and text her husband 'Hi Jay' and it would come up 'Hi you're a fat bitch! lol jk' which seemed like a pretty harmless joke that he wouldn't really be offended by. So I sit back to wait for the outcome.

Fast forward a couple of hours and I hear an ungodly hammering of my front door. I answer the door and she shoves past me, ""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY PHONE?!?!"" I am completely taken aback by how angry she is and was like ""Sorry Kelly, it was only a joke, was Jay pissed off?"" to which she replied ""I didn't fucking text Jay, my friend's mum had just died, I wrote to her on facebook to say 'So sorry for your loss, thinking of you, love Kelly and Jay'"" What she had actually written was ""So sorry for your loss, thinking of you, love Kelly and you're a fat bitch! lol jk""

TIFU by trying to have a threesome with my girlfriend.,"So this happened last night. My girlfriend and I have been trying to have a threesome for a while now but could never really find the right girl. Yesterday she reconnected with one of her old middle school friend and they were hanging out at the mall. She called me and asked if they could come by my place after for some drinks and I agreed.

They come over around 9pm and my girlfriend gave me that look. I knew that she talked to her about having a threesome with us and the girl agreed to it. So I play some music and bring out some drinks. Everything is going good until she brings out her own stash of alcohol and weed.

The girl brought two 4Locos and starts chugging. (For those who don't know 4Locos is this really harsh alcoholic drink that's 4 servings of alcohol in one can that can really fuck you up.) She has two of them. Then she rolls a blunt and smokes it. (I didn't drink or smoke at all) By that time my girlfriend is tipsy from the Hennessy I have and starts making out with me. The girl is on the bed watching and obviously starts getting turned on. But a few minutes later she told us she's really tired and wants to go back home. I'm bummed out but we all get in the car and I drive her home.

I'm driving her home down these dark back roads. The whole time she's telling us how she loves having us as friends and that she's sorry for being so tired and all that. Then she starts gagging and making pre vomit sounds I guess? Anyways I pull over to the side of the road so she can do her business. She gets out and starts sprinting down the road (Rip Me) I start chasing her down the the dark road and I catch up. She looks me dead in the face and asked me who I was. I told her I'm her friend and that she's not feeling well and my girlfriend and I was taking her home. She's says ok but continues to walk away and a car goes by. She waves her arms and screams for help and I grab  her saying wtf are you doing? Then she bites the shit out my hand. I let go and she runs into the street. I'm a black guy with dreads and she's a skinny white girlfriend so the sight of me chasing her is pretty comical. She managed to flag down a truck, a man and wife, and begs them for help. My girlfriend pulled up and very calmly told her friend to get back in the car. The girl screamed get away from me hides in the bush. The couple calls the police. The police showed up and asked everyone questions and took the girl back to her parents place.

No sex was had but instead I got a few cuts from the bite so that's kinda kinky I guess.

Tl:dr- Girlfriend comes over with her friend for a threesome. Friend gets drunk and high instead and runs away. Friend freaks out and bites my hand and strangers calls the police. Police takes her home

Husband [31] makes fun of me [25] around his family for earning little money,"We are married for six months now. He started doing this about two months ago and does it often since then. 
He earns about 3k monthly while I get just 750€. I work as sales assistant in retail, he is a process mechanic. That being said before we married he tried to convince me to staying home and promised to care about me but I didn't want that, I also wanted to work.
Now he makes fun about my earnings, mostly on family events. He says things like ""I need vacation. What about you go to work and I take some free time for myself? Oh but wait, we would starve with your pay, right?"" 
""Get a real job""
""What you are tired? I wish you could work at our company for one day, then you would know what it is to be tired!""


I felt awful maybe because he is right, he pays our rent our bills and everything but I tought we had a balance by me doing all the houshold and paying for groceries, cook and so on.
I told him that I don't like it when he makes my job looking worthless but he just says that it's the truth because I dont earn much money. We started to fight because of this almost every day. I don't know what to do. I tough about doing a second job but I don't know how to manage it because I also do distance learning. Any advices?

(UPDATE):My MIL exposed my (28f) past group-assault to my husband (34m). Who had no idea. Wants him to divorce me. Please help me.,"Tldr: MIL told my Husband and their family about my assault after stealing my journal where I wrote about it in detail and how it caused my infertility. Hubby and I are solid. She then texted everyone pictures of the things written in my journal and said she was doing the Christian thing. 

Hi guys, I just wanted to give you a quick update about a post I made 5 days ago on here. You were very kind to me. Thank you. It got locked and deleted because I had the wrong username so I've just made another account and added the ""throwRA"" to my normal username LullabelleAnabelle, so I can make a quick update for this subreddit. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to my post because I posted it on another subreddit too. A lot of you suggested I go to the mother in law subreddit which was also a big help. Thank you everyone. You're wonderful. 

To clear a few things you enquired about and to just speak about my wonderful partner a little more (if I may). I'm not American, European born and raised, but my husband is and we live here. We met at his friend's wedding where I did the bride's makeup (I'm a wedding mua), and he drunkenly told me during the reception that she looked a bit like a chucky doll (she didn't, and he still doesn't know or care what blusher is). We had some serious words, mostly where I told him to stfu, and then he invited me to dinner as a way of apologising for being an ass and I fell hard. And you guys are so right, he is the best person I have ever met. He's a serious, stoic, super focused and quiet kind of guy, doesn't really speak or smile until he needs to but he's so sarcastic and funny and charming and just so sweet and kind. And he says that he really enjoys my giddy chatterbox. So I think I'll need to hold onto him because that type of patience is rare. He's just my world. 

It hasn't been easy. A few things have happened and I can't honestly say that I'm better off for it. But I'm trying.  Again, really not a troll post. I'm not creative enough to write something that fantastical. This is all true and a little bit long so im sorry for that. 

I didn't know how to tell him. Or what I wanted to tell him. A bunch of you said to show him this page or my diary but those were my private thoughts, I didn't want to show him ever. So, I told him I could show him the details of the court transcripts and my medical records. They aren't particularly easy to read. Those men weren't very nice to me. They had found me walking through a park near my house in the evening and grabbed me and pulled me behind one of the paths where a lot of trees and bushes were. And they had gone to jail. 

He got really upset and told me that he didn't care what any of those pieces of paper said, he knew instantly that his mother was lying and just spewing bullshit. That I didn't have to work up the courage to tell him anything about my past if I didn't want to, he'd never thought for a second I was ever hiding anything from him that would ruin our relationship. He'd always known there was something because of the way my anxiety would come out and my nightmares and struggles during intimacy at times, but he would never have pushed the issue. He wanted me to feel safe with him and he trusted me completely. He said he was so scared that I would leave, especially after offering him a divorce. And he was keeping his family away from me because he didn't want them to stress me out any further. They were just confused and concerned and trying to reach out to us. Nothing malicious or accusing. 

I thought it was going to all be okay eventually but unfortunately, 3 nights ago, she sent him a text with some pictures of some parts of my journal. She'd taken pictures of the parts where I described things that had happened almost too vividly and then I had pointed out ways I could have defended myself and questioned why I hadn't fought back, before explaining it away as being my fault, blaming it on the way my body had developed and the way I looked and wanting them to do those things to me. Its a disgusting, jumbled piece of my mental state at the time. It was stupid but it was just a way back then to pull all my negative thoughts out of my head and get rid of them so I didn't have to think about the ways I could have stopped it. Maybe it was the wrong way to do it but it's all I had, I never went to therapy. She put in her message that I had spread my legs and got her son to believe my sob story but she had proof I was a willing whore and she would never let her children and grandchildren be alienated from her. 

His sister rang him crying and told him that their mom had sent her the same text. And to the other siblings and some others in the family. Fil was apparently furious and the family have reached out multiple times to my poor husband to apologise and ask after me. 

Things haven't been going well. My husband is so broken over his mother's actions and is just lashing out. He's broken all ties with her and is just so furious at anyone in the family who even reaches out to ask if we're doing okay. He won't let them get in contact with me and is just so angry. He owns the house my in-laws live in and financially supports them 100% and has told them that they'll need to get out immediately and he's done financing their shit. But I'm trying to get him to not do that. It's just a house and some money, it doesn't matter. I don't know how to comfort him or what to say or do to reassure him that he is not to blame for what she's done. 

As for me, I'm just in a fog. I don't know how to process what she did, so I'm not going to until I'm ready. My husband isn't leaving me alone and it helps to just cuddle up and pretend nothing has happened for a little bit. I think we might start some couples therapy, just to be able to learn ways to help each other through this and become closer and communicate better. I'm not ready for any therapy regarding my own stuff yet. It sickens me that they know this about me, that they know a chunk of what my feelings and thoughts were back then. I hate it so much that my husband read those parts and he knows I thought like that about myself. I never wanted to be some damaged victim in front of him. Its just shit. 

I won't be posting on here again. 
Thank you all for your lovely words. I hope you take care.

Edit: thank you all so much for being so kind and wonderful. And thank you to the commenters who privately messaged me telling me how much I must have enjoyed and asked for it and offering to reenact it with me again. No.",relationship_advice

"Apartment owner wants WiFi thermostat registration just to ""watch""","I'm in Florida.

I rent from an HOA, through a landlord. The owner of my apartment wants to use the internet enabled thermostat ""just to watch"". The thermostat has abilities to link to the internet so you can change and monitor the temperature remotely, which is a function I would like to use.

Repeatedly, my landlord informed me that the owner wants to ""look"" at the thermostat. I've always feigned not knowing about it. When I first set it up, I had to de-register the last user, who I thought was the previous tenant, not the owner.

I consider this private information, as the schedule of cooling and heating indicates when I'm at home. It would also reveal any vacations away from my apartment, unless I just waste money to keep the apartment cool.

Most recently, the landlord told me the owner now wants to see the thermostat (I assume re-register as the user) under threat of stopping internet service. I have not yet responded to my landlord. I have never met, seen, or talked to the owner.

Internet service is among the lease requirements, but I suppose he could downgrade it to something unusable.

AFAIK, thermostat control is not required to be in his name. Furthermore, it just seems way more reasonable for me, the tenant, to have sole access to that info.

What throws this into murky waters is that I understood the lease I signed to be demonstrative and not ""real"", as part of a tenant application process - that the real lease would be signed after I was approved.

I was hesitant to sign this electronic lease, and only did so after asking, via phone call, the landlord to email me saying the lease was not real. She replied ""dates are wrong [in the lease]"" in an email.

I decided it was enough since I was in a rush to move in, so I went with it anyways.

Later I called her after being approved to find out when the real lease signing was to take place. She said, as a matter of fact, the first one was already real.

Any ideas if this is worth pursuing? I think it's silly for the owner to need this thermostat more than I do.",legaladvice

My father is abusive towards my mom (serious),"Throwaway.

Some quick context: my mom wants to divorce my dad because he cheated on her 3 times and still does to this day but when she brings that up he gets crazy and insults her and hits her (not as hard to kill her or do some serious damage, but she still gets bruises). When he gets drunk he also gets really mad and does the same thing but this time he threatens me when I intervene.

TIFU by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye.,"Well, fuck. 

Not a throwaway because I have no shame left to feel. 

TIFU by orgasming so many times I went blind in one eye. That's right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

Seriously, though. Last night I was trying to sleep (obligatory ""not technically today"") but failing miserably. I have bipolar disorder, I'm off my medication (that is a TIFU in itself), and I was in the early stages of a manic episode. For those who aren't batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. I tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my Mothman musical, and thinking about Al Gore. At about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, I decided I had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

[Enter stage left] lesbian porn. Here's the part where I mention how my clit is made of steel. I came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. For some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. Having finished the porn (which I actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) I decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. Now, whenever I'm jerking off to just my vile thoughts, I always have to go completely under the covers. Unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where I live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. Super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? Anyway, for some reason I can't come on my own if my head isn't under some blankets/cloaked. Maybe Saudi Arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? Since this incident I've only slept for four hours. I'm losing my mind. 

Anyway, at this point I'm abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. After ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. My clit breathes a sigh of relief and I emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. My right eye is stinging a little bit, and I realise the acne treatment I'd put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. I grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

I'm sure you can see where this is going, but I certainly didn't. And now I could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. I wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. The weird angle I'm bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. For some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. I felt genuinely betrayed. Like, how dare you? YOU did this to me. This is YOUR fault. Et tu, Clite? 

Once my eye starts to swell up, I call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. Arguably the weirdest walk of shame I've ever done. 

I continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn't go down, an eye patch. The swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. My eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of ""what the fuck have i done"" red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

Now I've got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that I'll probably have to cancel. I've been wanting to bang this guy for WEEKS. Also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and I can't even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish I'm shit out of luck. 

TL;DR: I masturbated and now I'm
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

EDIT: Sweet baby jesus's clit, what the fuck? This blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if I wrote it. Damn my unforgettable Mothman musical. Anyway, I did not cancel my dick appointment. I told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (Less endearing when I got to his place and wouldn't stop dirty talking using pirate puns. I've never been more grateful for the colloquialism ""booty""). Also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. Hallelujah.

Relationship in jeopardy because I (21m) asked my fiancé(21f) for a prenup.,"Me and my girlfriend have been together since we were in the 6th grade. I love and trust her more than ANYTHING in the world. Shortly after hs she decided to go to college and I decided not to so I could pursue starting a business like I dreamed of. Long story short, I was lucky enough to be successful quickly and sold my first startup 2 years after graduating for a very large amount of money. We decided together that she would drop out of college and work for me as an employee on my second company and we would live together. Not too long after that I proposed, she said yes, and then the happy side of the story ends. Now I hate to admit it, but I absolutely worship money. I know people say it's not a good thing to do, but I grew up watching my single mom struggle to put food on the table for me and my siblings. Often going nights hungry because she had to feed a family with $20 and wanted to leave enough for us. It was engrained in my mind that I needed to make money so I could support my mother and younger siblings so they don't have to live under those conditions anymore. So when I proposed a prenup to my girlfriend she was livid. She couldn't believe that I didn't trust her or have any faith in our relationship, and felt outright disrespected that I would even entertain the idea. She left me with an ultimatum of no prenup or no relationship at all. I'm completely conflicted. She's the love of my life and I genuinely do trust her with every bone in my body, but I can't jeopardize the stability of the financial freedom I'm providing for my mom and my younger siblings (4 of them oldest being 15 youngest is 6). I don't want to put their lives in the hands of somebody they don't know as well as me and can't trust, because if worse case scenario happens and we get divorced I need to know that won't effect us in anyway. Any advice?


Edit 1: I see a lot of people assuming I coerced her into dropping out of college and sacrificing her future to help me and my dreams out. This isn't the case. She wanted to drop out because she hated driving to and from my house and college all the time and leaving stuff at her dorm or my house when she needed it. She wanted to just live with me and work and I told her I'm ok with that (I was actually ecstatic bc I ofc wanted to see her all day), then offered her a receptionist job since it was easy and nearby since she wanted to work. She DID NOT drop out and help me build my company. It was already operational.


Edit 2: I also idiotically forgot to mention that I kinda rained on her parade when I did it. She seemed like she was having the time of her life planning the wedding and I kinda just sacked her with a prenup. Should've found a way to ease into it in hindsight.",relationship_advice

Update: I think my husband cause our neighbor to commit suicide,"Hello, everyone. Considering the flood of messages and responses I have received, I decided that I would put out a response as soon as I had gotten myself together. I hope to answer a few questions and give you a bit more information on what has happened. 

Why did I let my husband take the money? 
I did not know how much she gave my husband until he came back to the backyard. I would have told him to give it back if she'd still been in the neighborhood but she'd driven off. 

Why/what did your husband tell the father? 
My husband is a military man with very strong morals. He believed that helping her lie to her father was morally wrong. He tried to return the money to her father and told him that his daughter hit our fence, paid for it and asked us not to tell him but because we had the supplies, he was looking to return the money and get him updated on the situation. The father did not accept the money and ""slammed"" the door shut. 

Why didn't you notice anything was wrong?
My husband and I are Catholics in a predominantly Mormon neighborhood. We are mostly ignored. Up until a few days ago, we hadn't spoken to more than a few neighbors besides in passing and knew nothing about their home or family lives. We have never been around children and took her crying for normal teenage hysterics. 

Did you tell the police?
Yes. I called the non-emergency line this morning and told the operator about what I knew since my husband was afraid they might arrest him for not reporting what he saw. They did not ask to take my statement down at the station but said they would ""look into it"". The funeral is in a few days and we are not invited. I donated a few hundred dollars to a charity chosen by the mother that her daughter supported and will be picking up their younger sons from school in a few hours. 

My husband and I are looking to book separate appointments with a counselor nearby. I do not know if I blame him for her death but it has brought some things to light that make me very nervous. He called our lawyer to see if he could be held liable before telling me what happened, tried to hide that he knew the girl was dead, and generally acted in bad faith. It is a culmination of everything I dislike about him and I do not know how to move forward.

No, I do not know how she died and I am not going to ask.

My wife is cheating on me on F*cking Valentine's day,"I am crushed right now. Now I have a real reason to hate valentine's day. This morning, before leaving to work, I[32M] saw my wife's[33F]  phone notification light flashing so I checked, it was a message from a private number so I read through all the messages. The messages were from the night before and here are how some went; 'hey can't wait to see you tomorrow my husband is going to work so we have all morning long' 'Look wear something like this for me tomorrow baby' 'I wanna be inside you already especially inside your own house' 'I will do anything you want me to do for you in bed, I'm doing specially for you I don't even do it for my husband'. We have been together for 12 years total and we had plans to have kids already and have a family

I took pictures of the chat with my phone since I think this is most likely ending in a divorce. I decided to come home early and I walked into my house silently and it was confirmed they were cheating on my own bed. I left without making noise and I had a big beautiful rose for her, I cut a small part of my wrist and let some blood on the paper with the rose and I wrote a note to her saying 'here is your love'.

I drove off to a liquor store and bought whiskey and swishers and I picked up half an ounce of Marijuana from a friend. I drove to a mountain that has a cliff of the whole city and right now I'm here and she keeps on texting and calling me like she is desperate. I am losing my mind here. I am still up here just looking at the lights and I feel like my world just ended. I hate the thought of myself now and I just feel like I don't even belong here anymore

Tl;dr my wife is cheating on valentin'es day and I don't want to be here anymore

Update 1- I am driving home now and will probably sleep outside in the hammock or something

Update: I am home safe now ordered some food and I have another blunt left but I will stay outside in the backyard for now- I am invited my cousin and his wife over, he is basically like a brother to me so I will most likely be okay

Update- she heard my cousin and his wife pull up and she came out. Okay she started crying and basically throwing a tantrum and begging me to forgive her. Well my cousin's wife Maria took her inside and sat down with her so they're talking and I'm outside with my cousin taking a smoke break

Update: I woke up to her crying to me and begging. I didn't say anything. I feel dead on the inside like if somebody ripped my heart out and smashed it on the floor

Edit:i didn't expect even half of these comments thanks a lot for the support sorry if I don't grt to reply to everyone I fell asleep. I am off to work for the day and will rewd your comments after I am back thanks again

Edit: I haven't done much yet but I plan on going up the mountain again with my cousin and his wife to look down at the lights. We are going to hang out up there and hit some Wax to relax a little. I talked to my wife finalky asking why she cheated and I don't know whether to believe this or not but she said 'it was the thrill of having a new guy showeing with attention"" then again she cried and begging to work it out and I went for a walk without saying a word. Apparently she has been talking this guy for a few months and met him at a grocery store. She told me the while truth and that they onky went in dates and that that was the first time the had sex. I am not trying to be cucked so fuck no I am not trying to fix this shit anymore I'm done being a helpess mister fucking nice guy.

TIFU by throwing shit out of the window,"Hello reddit.

English is not my first language.

I just moved from a small city to a larger one because I got a better paying job on a bigger company. I work as a software engineer. On my first day I received an invite for a meeting but it was just for the men of the floor, not the women. The invite had no subject, and there were different team's so it could not been related to work. I attended the meeting, and the summary was that there was a legendary pooper on the office. No one could caught him, and he would always take big shits, all over the stalls, on the walls, and such, leaving an horrible mess behind.

He was even known as the ninja pooper, because one day  he took one of his big shits and them when people found it, the shit had one footprint on it, and by investigating it, people concluded that it was fresh. So they put the whole company on lockdown and looked through everyone shoe's soles but found nothing.

The human resources would often take pictures and send them to all of the men of the company, trying to shame the unknown ninja pooper into a confession. And it was not a intestine issue either, because his ""attacks"" would only occur when the company did something bad. It was always ""politic"". Unpaid overtime? shit all over the bathroom. Too much overtime? shit all over the bathroom. Switching health insurance to a worst plan? shit all over. No bonus that semester? shit all over.

And in the meeting, the men of the floor were really tired of his shit (sorry for the pun), and were telling that they would caught him in the end. And they even were suspecting that the ninja pooper could be more than one person, so that's the reason that he was not caught yet. The multiple pooper theory is important to my fuck up.

A couple of months and some shit attacks later, I was having a hard time with the work. too much to do and too little time left. As I was really worried with a task, the urge to take a shit starts to get stronger and stronger. being too focused on my coding I ignored it as much as I can, until I could keep it in no more.

Here is the fuck up. I got up and rushed to the nearest bathroom. A single bathroom with no stalls. Did my business. When I tried to flush, the horrible conclusion came to mind. It was clogged. Then for no reason the multiple ninja poopers came to my mind and I was really scared of being labeled one. And if I took too long in the bathroom I would raise more suspicion to myself. Well, in a fit of desperation I took toilet paper, made a glove, took the shit (Lucky me, the shit was a single and really solid piece) and threw it out of the window.

Now, my office was on the 7th floor. The time was around 2PM. I never ever looked out the window, or talked to anyone about that. till the end of my work day, no emails or commentary were made. I started to fell safe and relaxed, thinking that it was all over.

Then, by 6 PM came an email saying that the office would change buildings. Listening to the gossip, it became clear.

My poop wrap came undone mid air and the shit landed on the white car's hood of one of the directors of my company. He them accused the sewage of the building, the building denied, The conflict escalated and the office will change to 5-7 blocks away. That is really bad because the office was right in front of a subway station, now it will be in a worst building and location. It may even need an extra bus fare in days of rain. Some people are already thinking about changing jobs over this. \*\[EDIT\] Also, the relationship with the building was strained already because the rent was expensive, the building had a lot of companies and the parking was not evenly divided, and other issues about past rents. that shit was the last strain to go. As for the window, the building is not that big, so it have small windows in the bathrooms to exchange air. there was not a central AC.

Thank you for you time.

TLDR; I was heavily in need of taking a shit and took it in a clogged toiled. got scared and trew it out of the window of the seventh floor, landed on a director's car, caused a fight with the office building and my entire company is changing address now.

CT - Boss dictates weekend activities?,"Hello - writing on behalf of a friend ""John"". (x-posting to r/askhr)

In the past year, John started working at a new job. He loves what he does at his job but he's had some issues with some of the unspoken expectations that he has learned of as he has gone along (yes he is already looking for new employment). John works a typical Monday-Friday schedule with nights and weekends off. Occasionally during the times he's not at work, he will get phone calls from the people he supervises with questions. (Probably worth noting here that John is an exempt salaried employee.)

One weekend, John was moving into a new place and one morning his boss (let's call her Karen!) called telling him that he needed to come in to work because one of his direct employees had called out and there was no other employee at the same level that could cover. John explained to Karen that he was in the middle of moving and literally waiting for the moving truck to arrive at his new house. Karen told him that it was an emergency and these things happen ""sometimes"" and he HAD to come in. So John went in and myself and another friend met the truck at the house.

The next instance was when John was at brunch. He again was called into work to cover for one of his direct reports. He told Karen that he absolutely could not come in as he had been drinking at brunch, had not taken his car to the restaurant, and felt he was too intoxicated to drive. Karen told him that he should ""watch what he does"" on the weekends. John wound up calling all of his direct employees and found someone that COULD cover.

After this, John approached Karen about having some type of on-call schedule. His reasoning was that he totally understood that there were times that he would need to come in outside his regular hours but he felt that he couldn't live his life - he felt like he couldn't travel far from work, couldn't go out with friends, or couldn't be somewhere that he wasn't accessible by phone. Karen told him that ""this was nonsense"" and that he could do whatever he wants on his time off. John specifically pointed out the issue that happened with brunch and she told him that she doesn't drink and that she was ""surprised by his behavior"". John again stated he would feel more comfortable with some type of schedule so that if he knows he's the one that would be called in, he would stay close to his job and refrain from drinking. Karen said they would not be creating an on-call schedule and that he shouldn't worry about having to be called in since it happened infrequently.

So now we've reached the part where John asked me to look into this for him. Our friend group had planned an overnight outing (Saturday-Sunday) for next weekend at a location about four hours from where John works. Since John was not scheduled for those days, he didn't request any time off, figuring he would drive up on Friday evening and return Sunday evening. A few of us did take Friday off work so two weeks ago John asked if it would be possible for him to take that Friday off. Karen asked him why he wanted that Friday off so John explained that he had weekend plans and would like to leave a bit early if possible. Karen then told him that he could NOT go away for that weekend because she had weekend plans and he would need to be on call. He asked if any other employees that are at his level could be on call and Karen told him no because they also had other plans. Nobody had requested any time off because it was the weekend but I guess John was just the last to disclose his weekend plans?

From his previous job, John is aware of a Connecticut law that says people cannot work more than six calendar days in one week or twelve consecutive days ([https://www.cbia.com/news/hr-safety/hr-hotline-many-consecutive-days-can-employees-required-work/](https://www.cbia.com/news/hr-safety/hr-hotline-many-consecutive-days-can-employees-required-work/)) but he is unsure of how this applies to being on call. John is working on-site this coming Sunday so if being on-call counts as working, that means he should be allowed to not work on Saturday, correct?

Outside of this specific incident, is being on-call basically 24/7 even legal?

&#x200B;

EDIT: A bunch of people have been commenting that he should just not answer his phone. He did this once inadvertently. Karen called him at some super early hour (like before 5 am) because coverage was needed. He didn't answer because he was sleeping. She tried several times but a ringing phone will not wake him up. Karen proceeded to call his emergency contact (me!) at whatever ridiculous hour it was and she told me that she was a) worried about him because he wasn't answering and b) needed me to relay the info to him. I was half asleep so agreed but made him take me off as his emergency contact.",legaladvice

Is this seriously a legal requirement? Or some policy that the clinic came up with for their own weird reasons? I can't possibly imagine that I should need someone else's permission to get birth control.

"(WV) Neighbor paints curb yellow across from driveway on public street to prevent us from parking there, then paints it white so his wife can permanently park there for weeks.

Our house sits on one side of this corner/""end"" and our neighbor is directly across from us. He parks a huge RV/his truck in his driveway so his wife has to park her van around the corner on the other street instead of in his driveway.

When we moved in, there was an area outside of our front yard that the curb was clearly not painted and we used it maybe 4-5 times when we had friends visit.   This curb is directly across from his driveway. He asked us one day to not park there anymore because it was hard for his wife to get out of the driveway (whose van never moves from the spot around the corner?) and we agreed to avoid it unless we had guests. He didn't seem satisfied with our answer but left.

A day or so later we noticed that he had spray painted (literally) the curb yellow overnight so that we couldn't park there anymore. We just shrugged it off because parking isn't a huge deal and I'm not about to go to war with a neighbor over something so silly. However, a few days later he spray painted it white, then parked his wife's van there and it didn't move for weeks. They just left for vacation before Christmas and he spray painted it yellow AGAIN, parked the van in their driveway and took the truck wherever they went. This all seems super petty and dumb, but my husband parked there since they were gone last night and this morning we had a parking citation. 

Our neighbor has a ring on his door and I feel that he saw the movement, saw the parked car, and called the cops. It is painfully obvious he is spray painting the curb (different color yellow, paint sprayed into our grass, cinder blocks just sitting there so he can use them again next paint job). 

What can I do? Is this behavior even legal? How can I contest the citation?

WIBTA for selling my son's home because they decided to be childfree?,"I know the title sounds bad but hear me out.

I'm 47F, my husband is 49M, my son is 28M, his fiancee is 27F.

When my son proposed, we talked to both he and his fiancee to find out their game plans for the future. We wanted to buy them a house but one question decided *how big*: do they plan on having children?

Their answer was ""yes"", so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. Because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. At least in our names, our family is protected. We think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing.

They've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this October. But we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. This is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. But it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption.

We would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. But instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. This is like the difference of a factor of two. We spent our money needlessly.

I'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. My husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. I don't think they did it with malice ""hehe we get a bigger house if we lie"", but I think they knew they didn't want children. You don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right?

Would I be the asshole for selling their home? We'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. They'd never be homeless.

**EDIT**

Just so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. The problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. Children need extra space. Now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house.

Our other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. Same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. In our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. This is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. There's already been hubbub between my children ""why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom"", etc. ""Because they're having children"" can't be our reasoning anymore.",AmItheAsshole

So as the title says my, soon to be ex wife, works 15-20hrs per week making minimum wage. Doesn't have any medical disabilities or anything like that stopping her from getting a job. The job she currently has is after care for a local school. 

I have told her in the past that she needs to get something that pays more or get another job sense she has set hours and she would yell back at me that she has a job, it's not her fault she gets Summers off or doesn't work more.

I work at a grocery store in the meat department and make 40k ish a year. Working 30-40hrs a week making 19.20hr.

She currently is living with her parents and has no plans on getting her own place. Her only bills are her auto insurance and gas. Her parents pay for everything else.

I got my own place after we split up and am paying for everything myself. I have given her $770 so far to help with remaining bills.

We were married for 5 years with no kids and she is trying to get me to pay her $500 a month for 2.5 years. I countered with $250 a month for 1 year and she rejected it.

I personally think that she should not get anything and that I shouldn't have to pay someone because they were too lazy to get a job themself. Am I wrong in thinking this?

First of all I want to thank everyone for reading my previous post and giving me good advice. Your comments gave me further insight in this situation. I apologize for not giving you guys frequent updates to this situation as I was busy with work.

So after my last post I talked with my friends and my college professors about this mess. Fortunately almost all of them were ready to help. Later during that day we all decided to talk to my friend (21F). We explained to her about the severity of the situation as she was not ready to run away from her house and if she does not act fast she might end up getting married to the old thug ( I know though she might have been frozen in fear, as this is a important decision in her life and she had not made any such decisions before. She is of the type that always follows the crowd and obeys what the others say. ). After lot of convincing from me other friends and professors she finally decided to act. But she was still hesitant to run away as she might bring a lot of suffering to her little sister(14F) who would still be with her parents. So we had to act keeping her little sister in mind. So we convinced her to take her sister with her. We also involved her sister in our plan.

Now the main problem was where they would stay and who will help her get along. Which was managed by our professor *( Dr M. I will not give his full name here. But Dr sir I know you browse this sub so if you are reading this, I thank you million times. ).* Apparently our professor has a extended family thousands of kilometers from where we live, who are happy to let her and her sister stay rent free for sometime.

So on 25 july at 4am in morning we planned her and her sister escape. We made sure she took her important stuff and documents of her and her sister with her. After we had breakfast at one of my friends place. We all left for the train. We made sure she destroys her old sim card. Skip to the day 27 july we arrived at the place and I helped her unpack. Bought some clothes for her and her sister and overall they seem to get adjusted pretty quickly. We still need to take admission to school for her sister (Fortunately there are free schools for girls in India). And she recently landed a good job. So financially she is settled, but I will still be helping her however she needs.

Meanwhile recently we had filed police complaint about her parents and that man. We also informed women's welfare center about this. Things seem normal and I will keep you guys updated as things progress.

And I already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there's no way I want to go through it again so soon. I'm also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it's still in the womb. I don't want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won't be mine. I gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me ""it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me"". She told me all she wants is another baby and that I shouldn't deprive her of it when I can help her so easily. I tried to reason with her but she literally told me ""if you don't do this to me then I don't want a relationship with you anymore"". I asked her if she was serious and she told me ""yes"" and left. I don't know what to do. My mom is very stubborn and very vindictive so she probably means it at least for now. I'm not sure how I should handle this. I think she's acting crazy.",relationship_advice
Detained and Deported at London Stansted due to Airline incorrect re-routing,"This is a request for advice regarding an extremely unfortunate set of circumstances that led to a situation at London Stansted on Thursday April 18 and Friday April 19 (in the early hours of yesterday morning). I am a South African national, Dutch residence card holder who requires a visa when transiting through the UK. I was detained and deported from London Stansted on the night of Thursday April 18 and sent back to my port of departure (Eindhoven, Netherlands) in the early morning hours of April 19, Good Friday.

&#x200B;

I hold a full Dutch residence permit, and was travelling to Dublin, Ireland. My original flight was a direct Eindhoven - Dublin trip, but due to overbooking on the Airline (which I won't name at this point), I was denied boarding and given a rerouting free of charge through Stansted. Upon being given this routing, I asked to check if I was allowed to travel without a UK visa through Stansted. I was told yes from the Airline customer service, and that I could follow up with both Airport and Airline officials at Eindhoven when I arrived at EIN airport.Upon arrival at the airport, I insisted that Eindhoven officials call the Airline Immigration office to check the route was compatible with my travel documents. They did, and were told by the immigration manager there (of the Airline), that I was okay to board.

&#x200B;

This information was incorrect. I boarded the flight and was assured everything was okay. Upon arrival at Stansted, I was detained for 15 hours, interviewed, all belongings searched, my biometrics were taken, my photograph was taken, and then I was deported, and given a refusal-of-entry stamp on my passport. 

&#x200B;

I have gone back to Eindhoven and collected all the information to build a case against the Airline (and their immigration department in particular) for giving incorrect travel advice to Eindhoven airport officials, and by extension assuring me that it was okay to board when in fact I had absolutely no entry clearance whatsoever. I have contacted the South African embassy in the Hague. I have not received response yet, but hope they will stand by me and support me in this fiasco. I don't know what the consequences are of having a denial-of-entry stamp but it was completely not my fault. In fact, when I got back to Eindhoven, I insisted that an official there call English Immigration directly to confirm that I should never have been given the green light to board by the Airline Immigration officials (or re-routed via Stansted in the first place by the Airline). English immigration confirmed that Airline Immigration acted in error.

&#x200B;

I have documents proving the advice that was given to Eindhoven airport officials. I also have documents proving that Eindhoven supplied all necessary and complete information to the Airline before a decision was made. I have the name of the Airline immigration manager who gave the go-ahead, I have the boarding pass that clearly states: ""OK TO BOARD"" and I have the internal documents that state ""CALLD IMMIGRATION. SOUTH AFRICAN PP WITH DUTCH RESIDENCE CARD -- OK TO STANSTED"".

&#x200B;

I did not leave that airport until I had acquired scans of every document I could. I have scans of all internal documents with respect to my trip. I even have an email sent from the Airline Immigration Manager to the Manager of the Visa Check at the Airport saying ""Yes he can travel without a visa through UK if he has Dutch residence card hence my advice yesterday."" --> which is false.

&#x200B;

At this point, I have taken the following steps:

Made an official, strongly worded complaint to the Airline (and attached a name of a customer service rep who I spoke with for easier follow up)

I have contacted my embassy

I have contacted the British Home Office who runs the border force that detained me. Not with a complaint, but simply an explanation of what happened and why I was there, similar to above)

I have also sent a strongly worded complaint to the Airport, strategically knowing that the Airport will likely shift blame to the Airline when they see the docs and add pressure.

From the Airline's side, this is approaching professional negligence and I will pursue them as much as is humanly possible. I should never have been re-routed via Stansted, and I should never have been given an explicit green light to board (after asking multiple times and making calls to Airline immigration, and having been assured of my correctness in boarding).

Is there anything else I can do? Thanks for reading.",legaladvice

My wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary,"Tl;Dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. Brought flowers to wifes office. Found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

Yup. Tl;Dr  says it all. My (35m) wife (35f) and I were married ten years ago yesterday. She has been working on a big project for the last few months. The last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. This is a career maker for her.

 I work construction. With the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. So I work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. If its raining when I get up I dont go in. Somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. I usually hit the gym for an hour or two. Thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. We go home. I go to the gym as usual. I cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife Mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. We really havent seen much of each other this week. I went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. Not unusual for past month. 

I stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. Nichole was at the receptionist desk. I told her I got here later than I wanted could she put the flowers on Mehgans desk. She said ""I dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" She buzzed the door to get back to the offices. The place was deserted. I went to her office, the door was closed . I always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. I walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. She is giggling only as she can. Saying""we got to get this done"".  I am gut punched. I slammed the flowers down said ""Happy Anniversary"" and walked out. I didnt hear what she said just went past Nichole said goodbye and left. Made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

I balled my eyes out all the way home. Went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. I drove about 2 hours to a State Park. I had no idea what to do . I just had to run. I hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. I dont drink much so I had no booze, I just sat there thinking. Looking back I am glad I was in a rush, normally I bring a 45cal. With me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. The way I was feeling I might have ate the barrel that night. My phone was blowing up fom Mehgan so I had turned it off. I left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. I called him back. He said Meghan called him to check on me, make sure I didnt do anything stupid. We talked a bit, told him I got to think this thru, would catch up on Friday.

So while I am thinking about this, I go over our marriage from the beginning to see what I missed. We come from completely opposite backgrounds. My Grandfather raised me with my mom. He taught me about life. He had a little saying about everyhing. He told me marriage would be the hardest job ZI ever had, you had to work on it everyday. God I miss him. We did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. They worked hard and my brother and I did not miss out on anything we knew of.

Mehgan was born into money. Not overly rich but very comfortable. Went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. And she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. I would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  We met hit off started dating. I was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. We dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. Our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. Families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. Her dad and I started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

She graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. We work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. I took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. We agreed we had to experience the others interests. She was really enthused about the more physical things we did. I kinda like the symphony and such. I own two tuxes now.

I look back and do not see any red flags. Her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. She was paraded out in front for photo ops. Invited to conferences when other newbies were not. At dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. She quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . This 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. She seems very happy. We seemed very happy. 

So now, Friday, I am home. I called her. Asked where she was, back at work. I being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. She responded since I would not talk what was she to do? Fair enough. She will be home in an hour. So I wait. I want to save our marriage. If I am lacking in providing then I want to fix it. I want to ask why of course but I can not accept  a IDK answer. How do I phrase this? What else should I be asking? I know I will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  What she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. Thank you in advance.",relationship_advice

My [45M] Wife [42F] revealed she was unfaithful and I'm divorcing her. Our children [15F & 17M] hate me for it.,"Edit: Guys, I appreciate the advice. But I'm not asking on how to get past the infidelity. I've made my decision, and it's not something I'm willing to forgive. I'm looking for advice on how to handle this with my kids, and how to reassure them we can still be a family even if we aren't married.

My wife and I have been together for 18 years. We had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. We've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

About two weeks ago I brought up an advice column in the paper I had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and I could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so I asked her what was bothering her. She confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. This was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. She says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. Claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. We talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. I realized I knew I'd never be able to let this go, nor would I be able to forgive her. She's distraught.

We sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. Obviously this was extremely tough. They acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. My wife and I agreed to tell them it was mutual, but I guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. This had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. My wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. I don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so I'm being trying to explain as tactfully as I can, but they're gone as far as saying that when I get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that I still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. My wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since I've told her of my plan to leave.

I love my kids, but I don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. I don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that I'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. I just know that I cannot get past this, and for my own happiness I need to leave. Any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

Tl;dr wife revealed past infidelity. I'm leaving. Kids hate me for it.",relationship_advice

"AITA because I ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?","What I thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and I'm up at 7:05 AM dealing with it. I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. 

I'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. 

Last night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

Well to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

I offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

I woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

Was I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

Edit: I guess I've been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can't find out why.

To answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn't a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it's about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don't get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",AmItheAsshole
