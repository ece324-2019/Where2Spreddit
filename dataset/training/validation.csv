"for 'promoting religion at work'?. i'm a man with a hindu background working in the uk - that is to say i'm not very religious but my family are and if they're doing something related i don't mind joining in. it was a diwali this past weekend which is a pretty major festival in the hindu religion. 

i had a lot of indian sweets left over, and so i decided to bring 2 unopened boxes and leave them in the break room. at the end of our morning briefing, i stood up and said 'hey, it was diwali yesterday and so i brought in these sweets. help yourself and happy diwali!'. 

what was meant to be a nice gesture to ingratiate myself (i only started a fortnight ago) has left me seething after a meeting with hr. apparently, referencing diwali was akin to promoting a religion and therefore inappropriate at work. apparently i'd also given out hindu sweets (this i find ridiculous as they are just indian sweets with no religious connotations).

to me, it's no different from saying happy christmas which i know this company has no issue with, as evidenced by their christmas promotional video i watched in preparation for my interview. 

to be clear i know i'm not ta for brining in sweets, my question is to do with the promoting religion bit. i'm pretty sure i did no such thing, but it's possible i'm being blinded by my own involvement in the issue.",3
"because i finally learned how to wipe my butt. i asked my girlfriend the other day, ""why do the doors of the bathroom stalls have space on the bottom?""

she told me they're like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a ""duh\~"" tone.

i followed up by saying, ""but sometimes, people can see my butt.""

she started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.

so i had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; i wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.

i then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/(http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and i was shocked.

we were both curious where/how i even learned that from.

was it a potty training error? apparently not. we asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, & uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.

so, i've been wiping my butt and mooning hundreds of people in bathroom stalls for 20 years of my life.

\#dead

tl;dr

for 20 years, i squatted all the way to the ground after pooping in order to wipe my butt.",4

"by basically buying a serial killer starter kit at my local hardware store.... this happened earlier today and i'm pretty sure i'm on a police watch list now.

needed to pick up a few things from my local hardware store i was running low on that i like to have around. zip ties, duck tape, and things for quick repairs. 

while i was there i noticed they were having a store wide sale. i'm an avid outdoorsmen and with hunting season coming up i like to keep certain back up items in my truck if i need them. i figured i would grab some things while they are on sale.

walking through the isles i start randomly grabbing items i think i might need for my kit. such as a tarp, some rope, large knife, headlamp, latex gloves, and a lantern with extra batteries.

keep in mind i already have zip ties and duct tape in my cart when i walk up to the register. these are things i generally purchase, buy never all at once.

girl at the register greets me as i start placing items on the counter. i give her my number for rewards points and she quickly starts scanning things.

about half way through she slows down a bit. she looks down at my already bagged items, at the stuff left on the counter, and then back to me. i'm just standing there waiting with my wallet in hand, clueless as to what is now processing in her head.

then we have a light convo that in hindsight prob made things worse:

her: ""wow that's a big knife.""
me: ""yeah i like having cheap, throwaway knives around. same with tarps and stuff too.""
stares at me funny after my reply as she scans knife.

her: ""can i see your id to verify your at least 18 to purchase this.""
me being 30, going bald, and grey in my beard looks at her weird as i've never been asked for my id here. pull it out and hand it to her. 

she quickly looks at my id info and then glances up at her screen where i noticed my reward info was pulled up. didn't think anything of it at the time.

she says thanks, hands it back while still looking at it, and finishes scanning my items. almost looking like she was taking inventory of what i had.

she gives me my total and i hand her some cash (prob another red flag, no paper trail.)

i get my change, grab my bags, and head for the door. she yells back don't forget your receipt as she walks it over to me. i grab it as i notice her quickly glance up at the security camera in front of the door.
i say thanks and leave thinking that whole situation was weird.

i get home and start unpacking my bags to sort stuff out on my kitchen table when my wife comes up behind me. she glances at my items and jokingly asks if she should be worried.

i was like what? still clueless. before she points out that it looks like i'm about to go tie someone up and murder them.

girl at register must have thought the same thing. checked my info and i'm pretty sure made sure she got my face on the security camera in case someone pops up murdered on the news later.

told my wife about cashier and she about died laughing at me for being so clueless.

tl;dr: 
bought zip ties, duct tape, knife, tarp, rope, and other questionable items randomly for hunting season on sale at my local hardware store. pretty sure cashier thought i was a serial killer.",4
"by falling deeply in love with my own smell.. this didn't really happen today, more like over the course of the past 4 years. this is a throwaway because i'm very embarrassed. sorry about formatting, i'm typing this on mobile. my girlfriend of 3 years passed away in a car accident about 4 years ago. it was a horrible event and i still haven't been able to get back into the game since. i was and still am very much in love with her. now to the fuck up.

my favorite possession of all time is her pillow. it smells like her, and i usually sleep with it every night. i haven't washed it out of fear of losing the smell (i know, gross but i don't think straight anymore). i hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. but this morning when i went for a particularly long morning run i started smelling the smell. really strong. it confused me but i wasn't going to start complaining.

this morning, about 20 minutes ago i arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. and the smell grew more pungent. this was the moment i realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, i got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. i'm embarrassed and distraught that the smell i thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.

tl;dr- slept with my passed away girlfriends pillow for 4 years, and have fallen in love with my man sweat.

edit: i would reply to all of you if i could, but today has been very emotionally taxing. thanks for all your kind words.",4
"for removing the stereo faceplate from my car before a long (3+ hours) drive because my gf wouldn't stop muting it to take/make phone calls?. to preface this i think i might have overreacted because honestly? i can't stand driving. i hate it. but i gotta get places and where i live that means driving.

little bit of info first, my car is an older car with the stereo that you can change the faceplate, like the buttons and stuff. a few years ago i sent it to a mechanic friend for a tune-up and he put bluetooth in it as a gift.

i occasionally(usually averages out to once or twice every 2-3 months) have to drive several hours to see a specialist for a medical condition i've had since i was born. over the last year or so my gf(r) has started to come with me, which i appreciate very much because i know hospitals bring back a lot of not-good memories for her.

for the issue at hand. r is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told ""this is important"", or ""i need to hear this"". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.

it drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.

she's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.

edit: to answer some faqs, she doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.

i always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, dr death, ymh, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. i love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when i'm allowed to listen again

i can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.

i've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for that long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. i never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.

after thinking about it and how i felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and i feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. i'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough.",3
"neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the two spaces in front of our home. after asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving all their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home.. california here, getting that out of the way. and full disclosure, its not my home. the home belongs to my parents, but i house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus i love my parents and want what's best for them). i will just be saying my home or my driveway so i dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


these neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with all the memories. i thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

my parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. he has it parked in the middle so that it takes up all the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. it has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. why? i don't know. perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. all i know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

i want to also mention they have a full garage. they also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. and a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

i politely asked him to move his car when i saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. he followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. several days later i visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

i spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since i had asked him to move his car as payback. they said he's really mean and to just let it go. this did not sit right to me, so i later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. i explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

bad idea. i assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. i assumed mom would just tell 'billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. turns out he got it from mom and dad. i get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how i did not just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

i didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. my mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an fu to my mom and dad. that's also when their car got keyed

so since i made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. now the parents are retaliating too.they finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. the one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. the beater was moved so its parked on the other side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. sorry for the run-on sentence. did that all make sense? i hope so.

this has been going on for a few weeks now.

is there anything that can be done? my parent's just seem to want to let it go. not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. my parents travel a lot and my work makes it so i cant always be there to sit the house for them. they fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. i used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?


tldr - neighbors parked all their cars in front of my parents home and wont move them, only rearrange them. the neighbors go out of their way to be jerks to my parents. parents fear retaliation.",2

"dumped before valentine's day. so.... it's 11:09pm on february 13th. less than an hour until valentine's day. and my boyfriend of 7 years, who i had big plans with for tomorrow, just texted me out of nowhere and said our relationship is over. no explanation, nothing. then he blocked my number and all social media accounts. needless to say, i'm super confused and completely devastated. how am i supposed to survive valentine's day? it's always been our day. we've always done something big and extravagant because valentine's day is our anniversary. and i just feel crushed. some people have suggested i have a girls night, but i don't have really any friends that live near me. and i really don't want to have a night to myself, it just feels so cold and lonely. any advice?

edit: forgot to mention, not that it's super important to this specific situation, but him and i have a 2 year old son together. so it's not just me that this is going to effect, it's going to impact our son's life too.

edit 2: a lot of people are asking our ages and why we don't live together. i'm 20 years old, he's 22 years old. and we don't live together because we were given an eviction notice a few days before christmas telling us we had to vacate the premises by january 1st. it was such short notice, and right at christmas time, we had absolutely no money for a new apartment so we moved in with my parents. he lasted about 2 weeks in my parents house before deciding he couldn't live with them, he said it made him feel uncomfortable. so he moved back home with his family, almost 2 hours away from me and our son.

edit 3: my son was only in this post so people could understand that i'm not just being a whiny bitch because i got dumped. i'm upset because he not only walked out on me without any explanation, but he did the same to his kid. and please stop giving me shit for having a kid at 18. that was my decision, not yours. oh, and just so you assholes that were harassing me for getting evicted know, we didn't get evicted for not paying our rent. we got evicted because he invited friends over and they were smoking weed in the apartment whenever my son and i weren't around. we live in ny where weed isn't legal, so honestly he's lucky we only got evicted and he didn't end up in jail or worse, we lose our kid. so i'm not irresponsible for spending money on a trip months ago and getting evicted.",8

"by hiding in my girlfriend's room while her parents are home. as the title says, i am currently fucking up by being in my girlfriend's room. 

you may be thinking she's here with me, scared to be caught, but she's not. in fact she's nowhere near me, because she's at school.

my girlfriend and i live about an hour away from each other and she has school so you can imagine seeing each other is not the easier thing right away. my girlfriend also lives with her parents, and she's asian, meaning no boyfriend until college (though her mom seems okay with it).

on wednesday we developed a plan to have me sleepover her house without getting caught. the plan was simple, i would come when her parents were gone at work (they own a restaurant) and i would leave in the morning when her dad takes her to school because her mom would still be sleeping.

it went great, i made it out, even ran to my car which wasn't necessary because by the time her dad was coming back i was driving out of her neighbourhood. 

fast forward to that night and i end up going back over. thursday goes good, i go to her room in the morning and end up going back to sleep until she comes home. 

now it's friday morning. her dad almost caught us because he wanted to take the recycling out but she quickly got it for him. then she leaves, i lock her bedroom door and settle in her bed where i'll be for the next 7 hours waiting for her to come back. 

her dad comes back, comes upstairs, tries to open the door. fuck. it's locked. he pauses, turns the light on, i assume he looks in her brother's room, then tries the door again. still locked for obvious reasons he does not know about. he says something to himself (i don't speak chinese but i really wish i did), then goes back downstairs where he sleeps on the couch.

i text girlfriend, almost dying because of how scared i am to get caught. she tells me to chill, tells me they don't have keys to their doors, the only way to open it is to take the handle off. she texts her dad, saying the doors locked and she can unlock it later, he says okay. her dad doesn't always listen so that worries me.

pretty sure her dad went back to sleep now, and her mom isn't awake. now i'm currently laying in her bed wide awake, texting her, asking my parents what to do (have had similar experiences and got caught), and trying not to freak the fuck out because i can't do anything.

escaping is impossible. her window has blinds and a screen and is second story. going downstairs and out the door is foolish, her dad sleeps on the couch and the stairs are noisy. plus i have no idea what time her mom wakes up.

i have no choice but to sit it out for the next 7 hours, maybe try to get some rest but i doubt i will. anyone have any advice? she's 19, i'm 20, her parents don't even know she has a boyfriend.

i imagine they'll be beyond pissed if they find out i'm here, we'll both be fucked. not only is she dating me but i'm staying in her house without them knowing. it's scary to think there could be someone in your house and you wouldn't even know it, i feel bad for doing this but i love my girlfriend and i'm literal melted butter in her hands.

update: probably should have gotten up with her right away but chose to stay in bed... now i have to poop really badly. about 6 more hours to go though. rip my bowels and my asshole. also for some reason everything in her house fucking creaks, so i have to be very careful with what i do on the bed, sleeping position wise.

update 09:54 am, about 5 more hours: i still have to poop, not as badly though. however a new probably has arose. i grabbed a hard boiled egg earlier when her dad was gone, two baby oranges, and a piece of hawaiian bread. i ate the egg obviously because i can't really eat all day, and most of one of the baby oranges, and two bites off the little square of bread. tummy feels a bit weird. hope i don't throw up because it's very hard to be silent while your guts spill on the floor. also think of napping but too afraid i'll let out a massive fart or make some noise. girlfriend stopped replying due to class. i've given up the idea of escaping a long while ago. the dad is of no concern, pretty mid level threat but low for now. mom is high level once she wakes up though. hopefully she'll leave for work but it looks like that might not happen as she isn't awake yet and supposedly would leave at 10:30. 

quick update 09:55am: mom is awake and went downstairs, i think she'll make breakfast or something. dad is talking to mom, don't know what about. hope they don't try the door again, really feel like i'm gonna shit and throw up now.

good update 10:03 am: good news, pretty sure the mom just left, pretty sure i can hear her dad snoring. i can finally relax a little. might actually catch some shut eye. off to play a bit of fifa mobile and then maybe sleep for a few hours.

okay another update since it was asked for: 10:20 am, mom's long gone for sure, dad's asleep, not snoring but i'm pretty sure he's sleeping. unfortunately girlfriend hasn't answered texts for the last two hours i think. finally beat a team in fifa after playing them for the 20th time. every time the air conditioner turns on it makes this loud ass noise so every time that happens i get spooked. i'm glad everyone is getting a good laugh out of it. someone thought this post was fake, which is fine. not really sure how to prove it's real. as i said before hiding under the bed is impossible, the only place to hide is her closet which will be a tight squeeze. hoping it doesn't come to that. dad will probably sleep all day, as he stays up all night talking to his friends in china so his body is in another time zone. might just nap when the girlfriend comes home as she usually naps after class. thanks for the good luck. see you in an hour or when something interesting happens. 

updated 11:40 am: hello, my girlfriend knows this exists now so hello, enjoy my pain and these comments. so far dad's still asleep, mom is at work, ac still spooks me. here's some answers to questions: gf's birthday is late, yes dad works but ""he can't handle work"" so he goes later (around 6 i think?), and i'll make it clear now i'm not planning to escape, it would be stupid. i truly think gf's dad doesn't care enough to try and bust down the door. also yes, florida is a stand your ground are but dad doesn't own guns, just knives (i feel like i could run faster, used to play soccer and have been practicing boxing for years and more recently muay thai so i know how to run and fight). to those asking for proof, if you tell me how to upload a pic then i'd have no problem doing that. as for my poop situation, i still have to go but it's not that bad anymore. yes i have a bit or orange and bread left, and i have headphones that are supplying me with some nice spotify service. also, i played campaign mode in fifa, finally beat chapter 2 after 3 days. see you in an hour. 

not really an update but i'll post link to gf and i'd texts and her room door (had to reupload bc her face was exposed) proof reddit(https://imgur.com/gallery/9pv91je) 

update again: uhhhhh i didn't see a post that got deleted. i deleted the link to the pic bc it had her face in it, but i uploaded a new pic and posted the link up above. if this shit is deleted then uhhhh what the fuck reddit you wanna fight? as for my bowels, still gotta go but not as badly. i'm probably going to watch some youtube or netflix, since sleeping isn't a good idea. i'll update in an hour as always. 

update: try using your phone to view. anyway good news. as we speak i am shitting in the toilet. dad left. pooping has never felt so good. i'll update you when my girlfriend comes back.

update: girlfriend is home, i pooped as soon as the dad left. yes i know it's stupid staying longer but now that my girlfriend is home i'm safe. for those who are asking why didn't i leave when i got the food, there was a very tiny window to do things, and i didn't have my bag packed. there will be one more update after this when i get home, the true safe zone. as for now the girlfriend and i are going to play fifa and chill until i have to leave. 

final update: hello i am at my house in bed, nowhere near my girlfriend's parents. i have pooped twice, it went well thank you for asking. about my girlfriend's age,,, she went to school in china at first, and has a late birthday, therefore she's making up credits and will be going to actual uni soon. she's not finished university and gotten a degree, therefore, no boyfriend. for those of you saying she's an adult her parents don't control her... they do. as long as she lives there and they support her financially. not to mention she isn't white... she's asian (chinese specifically). i myself am italian/cuban, so the same rules go for me until i move out (planning to before the end of next year).  many of you ask why i didn't leave when her dad left to pick her up, instead pooping. first off i had to poop so badly. secondly i won't see her for awhile, and recently she got hurt so i've been helping tend to her wounds so she doesn't need to go to the hospital (mom's a nurse, taught me everything since i was young). i wanted to be there for her in person. also yes, her parents own a restaurant. i won't post anymore updates (99.9% chance i won't bc it's over) but will reply to dm's and replies :)

final permanent update: yes it's about almost a year later, she broke up with me a few months ago. i'm glad you all enjoyed my pain lmao just wanted to write this just in case anyone comes back to read this and is wondering what happened almost a year later. i'm currently happy, perhaps have a bit of a thing going on with a different girl, i'm mentally and physically better than when i did this stupid shit. i will never do this again, and i don't suggest anyone else does it, i had about 5 heart attacks throughout the whole thing and it was a shitty thing to do, if i was the dad and found out i would be beyond pissed. sorry mr.ex's dad. yeah, i hope everyone is doing well, i'm doing better, enjoy your day/night :)

i called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . he seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  he said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. i sat her down and we talked. all she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . i tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. i asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. she said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . so i did. she kept changing subjects or saying that "" a mother just feels it. you wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". she got very agitated and was crying telling me that if i wanted to leave her i should simply leave but i shouldn't call her a liar.

somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

after she did i went on her computer. i do **never** snoop on her. but i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . oh boy. she was in 2 facebook groups. one was a normal mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. in the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. they were feeding in each others delusions. a woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. my wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. so many women were making her fear that i would leave. saying things like men can not stick to a woman . many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

i was really fucking scared. i researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of schizophrenia(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3361851/). so to say the least i could not sleep. i was and am still very afraid of losing her. she woke up and i tried to act like nothing was wrong . we were going to the doctor. and it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. she was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. he was really tactful when talking to my wife. he tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. we tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. she got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . she began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . we could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . she could not breathe. the doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . she had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. did an ekg to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

at that point i really had no other option than to inquire about involuntary commit. so i could not do it myself . i needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . after that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". so far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . my wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. when i last her she was furious with me. she said i was taking away her freedom which i am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. she is so mad at me. i feel like i am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. i love her with all my heart. i am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . i feel like i failed to protect her. at this point i am just rambeling . sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . i feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : i will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! when i gave my vows i meant trough illness and bad times. i am not only on the ride for the good times. if you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? i am here to stay. i will not divorce her. she is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. i hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

sorry for the rant. but if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. i understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it beginns to mess with their mental health  and i respect that but i won't do that.

edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. she was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

i don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as i was so distraught. but i was not a sedative. i think it was something along the lines of valium or baldrian. over the counter stuff mostly.

she has family. she is estranged from most of them. her sister is now at our place to help.

also refrain from such stupid comments like ""i'll bet she will leave bro. she is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. just seems like you want me to divorce. get a life.",8

"by telling a girl on a first date that i work with deaf children and know sign language.  

so first of all i'll start off with a little context… i don't usually do formal first dates, especially when its with somebody i barely even know. however, i've just come back to university for my final year of studying and i met up with my old flat mate from last year. she had already moved into her new flat and met all of her new flat mates, one of which happened to be a very attractive girl who we will call stacey. now my old flat mate was always trying to set me up on dates last year at university, but i always had an excuse. now with it being a new year i thought ill have a fresh start and really knuckle down and stop going out all the time (i said exactly the same after my 1st year) and focus on my uni work and look for a serious relationship instead of having flings. 

so i get shown a few pictures of stacey and my old flat mate is telling me how nice she seems and how great she is and honestly i just thought why not, i may as well, what harm could going on a date possibly bring about? so she gives me staceys number and we start to text and chat for a couple of weeks and we seem to be getting along really well. so much so that i suggest we should go for some food one evening to meet in person and get to know one another a little better. now bearing in mind i never ever do this, i usually just speak to girls on nights out when i'm filled to the brim with liquid confidence and i'm usually so drunk that my confidence is through the roof. however i feel myself really starting to like this girl, i've never really been one for texting but our conversation seemed to flow naturally.

so i meet stacey at this very busy restaurant last week, i'm full of nerves but i'm ready for the date. we get sat down and we begin chatting away and things seem to be going really well. im still nervous but after a few pints the nerves start to settle and i get a bit carried away telling my stories and my somewhat crude jokes. at the best of times i'm a very loud person, however, after a few beers i turn into a human fog horn and unbeknownst to me, i'm speaking at a level high enough for the whole room to hear. i know this because all of my friends love to remind me how loud i am when we're on a night out. now here comes the fuck up. 

so being full of my favourite ale and with the nerves starting to settle, i'm growing louder and louder by the minute. so much so that stacey, very politely i must say, lets me know that i need to turn the volume down just a tad (especially when telling my alcohol fuelled jokes). now i'm not an angry person by any means, but i can't begin to count the amount of times i've been told to quieten down when drunk, and for some reason i decided this night was the night where i'd have enough. so instead of apologising like any normal person would, drunk me decided it would be a good idea to try and turn it back on stacey. i don't know what come over me but the only excuse i could muster was ""well i do apologise but, you see, i volunteer working with deaf children so i'm used to having to speak really loudly, i've actually just come from there before our date"". 

now if you knew me you would realise how ridiculous this sounds. once i told my friends and my old flat mate about what i had said they were falling to the floor with laughter. so far it doesn't seem that bad, until stacey says something along the lines of ""wow, i'm really sorry, that is great, you must know sign language then?"". drunk me thinking i'd got one up on her proceeded to nod and claim that i do in fact know sign language, i think i even threw up a few fake hand signs which probably looked more like gang signs to cover my tracks. however, what i didn't expect was for stacey to have a younger deaf brother who would apparently love to meet me as she's never dated a guy before who can do sign language!

honestly my heart sank, she was sat across the table from me signing something to me and god knows what she was saying. i just smiled and nodded and to this day i still don't know what she was saying but my unenthusiastic smile and nod seemed to work. i quickly moved the conversation along and got swiftly off the subject. so now stacey thinks i know sign language and what's even better is that she can't wait for me to meet her younger brother who would be so excited to be able to sign with a guy she's dating!

ive tried youtube videos but all i've managed to pick up on is being able to say vowels and ask someones name. i don't have the balls to tell her and i really don't know what to do. im seeing her again next week and i know i need to tell her the truth, she seems the sort of person who would just laugh it off but she seemed so happy when i told her and she's even suggesting we face time her brother when we're next together so i can have a conversation with him. i just feel like a dick now and i don't want to let her down or upset her younger brother, but i don't think asking him his name over and over is going to cut it. 

tl;dr im a loud idiot when i've had a drink and instead of apologising about being such on a first date with a girl, i tried to cover it up by claiming i work with deaf children and know sign language. turned out she has a younger deaf brother who she now wants me to meet and speak to using sign language. i don't have the first clue about how to sign and i don't have the balls to tell her the truth because i don't want hurt her or her brothers feelings.

edit

wow i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did, i've just woke up now and had a chance to read through all of your comments, thank you for the platinum and what not, i just want to clear up a few things i've read. 

thanks for all your concern regarding me possibly be a high functioning douche bag alcoholic. first of all when i say really loud, i'm not a boisterous loud, all attention to my please sort of loud, i just speak really loud when i'm drunk enough for other people to hear, it's because i get overly excited and it was a mix of that and the nerves which made me start talking over excitedly and get carried away with the volume. 
also i've seen a few comments about the lying. i know it wasn't right but that's why i tried to stress i never do anything like this, me and in person first dates just don't mix. my nerves just got the better of me and i'm an anxious person at the best of times, i knew right away that coming clean would have been the best thing to do but i'm so awkward that i just didn't know what to say or do and i just wanted to move on the conversation as quickly as possible. i said it in the first place intending it to be a light hearted joke (clearly i'm not funny), i wasn't actually going to roll with the lie that i work with deaf kids. however the last thing i expected was for her to come back with that and it just completely threw me off. i'm seeing her again next weekend so i'll be sure to update you all on how this turns out, thank you for all the advice and the genuine concern a lot of you have, and especially to all of you who have helped me see the funnier side of this situation.",4
"neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. update: i'll be sure to post updates so please stop pming me or replying to my comments/post history outside of this sub asking me to do so or suggesting i shit-bomb them back. 

my wife noted that what we think might be his kid comes around most weekends. in the interest of remaining neighborly and with the possibility neighbor dude might be losing his mind, we're going to talk with them before lawyering up or involving the fuzz. updates forthcoming.

original post:
hey all, i have a shitty situation here that i'm hoping to get some advice about. this is in idaho.

&#x200b;

my neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. a new neighbor bought a house across the street about 6 months ago. a few weeks back, i was working in the garage when i saw him take his dog directly across the street, into my front yard. he let it pee in my yard and then walked straight home. he didn't notice me  - my garage is set up as a shop and is pretty busy, and the garage door is up a lot - but this piqued my interest because it's goddamned weird. now, my wife and i have a dog so there are a few dog droppings from her that we pick up on a regular basis. my wife had been doing the dooty duty recently, so i asked her if there are more piles than normal. sure enough, she said there had been a ton for a while now. she figured it was assholes walking their dogs and letting them crap in our lawn. i figured it was our new weirdo neighbor.

&#x200b;

it happened again around a week later: i was in the garage as the neighbor took his dog into our lawn. this time the dog dropped a deuce and he started to walk away without picking it up. i called out to him, asking him if he needs a plastic bag to pick up after his dog, and he avoided eye contact and scurried back home.  i went across the street and knocked on his door. he didn't answer. we set up a security camera to discretely watch the front lawn and i kept an eye out for when he was next out in his yard so i could talk to him.

&#x200b;

i reviewed the footage over the next few days and, sure enough, he was consistently taking his dog to do the deed in our yard. why our yard? no clue, we've never had any interaction with this guy whatsoever. the next time i saw him walking to his car, i confronted him. i simply told him that i knew he was taking his dog to shit in our yard and if i caught him doing it again i'd call the police to report him for trespassing. he denied doing it, claiming it must be other neighbors, got in his car, and drove away with me standing in his driveway.

&#x200b;

so i review the footage from the last few days. dude is not walking his dog into my yard anymore: he's letting the dog shit in his yard. he then scoops it up, walks it across the street, and tosses it into my yard with a shovel. what the absolute fuck.

&#x200b;

how do i even begin handling this?",2
"a good movie is still a good movie even after an actor or director does something bad or illegal.. same with music and other media. you can enjoy watching or listening to something regardless of whether the person who made it was a kiddy fiddler or murdered someone. it's not a reflection on you or your beliefs.

too many people are so concerned with what these famous people are doing in their personal lives and i honestly couldn't care less as long as the things that entertain me aren't affected.",6
"by sleeping with a married woman.. so, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. nsfw or for anyone, really. and i may not be alive much longer, because i'm probably going to be murdered.

i'm at the bar the other night, watching the hall of fame game. after it's over, i go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before i uber home. this girl sitting next to me, very attractive. out of my league. like wayyy out. i'm just scrolling through memes on my phone. and she asks me 

""hey! can i trust you to watch my things and not drug me?""

 ""uhh what?""

 ""can you watch my stuff while i go pee and not drug me"" 

to which the bartender said ""oh you can trust greg, he's really nice"". annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. just random shit. showed pictures of our dogs to each other. talked about shows n stuff. typical 'meet a girl at a bar' flirting shit. she asks if i've ever seen the show years and years. i say ""no, but i've seen the band perform live"". so she goes on about how great the show is, and how i need to watch it. asks if i have hbogo. ""yes because i forgot to cancel my cable after got"". so she makes me download the app, so i could start watching it when i get home. thanks for the recommendation! i'll probably check it out never. so a few minutes later, she said

 ""hey do you live close by?"" 

""yea, like half a mile""

 ""we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. i have a bottle of whiskey in my car""

""idk, my house is kind of a mess right now""

""that's okay, i have pets too"" (or something like that. all i was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

""i mean i guess, but i have to be at work early tomorrow""

""that's okay, i can only stay 30-40 minutes and then i'll have to go home""
""that's fine"" heh, cuz that's all the time i'll need! am i right, fellas??

no. nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

it's about, 11pm at this point. i think? and mind you, i've only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

so we tab out, get in her car. which is a stick shift. and i say ""oh no shit, i like you even more now! no one drives a stick anymore! i drive one every day!"" which i'm excited about, because at this point i'm thinking to myself ""hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows i like, and imma bout to get laid""

we talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn't the first time that this subject came up). which is just a half mile away. so was a short drive. she parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

go inside, i try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. while i try to get my chromecast set up on my living room tv. ya know, to ""watch hbogo"".

she runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

it's fucking evan williams.

and this is the first time where an ""oh no"" thought crosses my mind.

kids, i've slept with some strange in my time. i don't know how or why i get myself into these situations. i honestly feel that i'm a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. sure i troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but i do genuinely care about other people. being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. but in this case, i was dead wrong.

so after some talking about random shit. we get the show playing. i couldn't even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

sex.

so after, we're just laying there. pillow talk. was a good night. i just got laid. she asked if she could stay the night. we're gonna go to sleep. everything is cool. i let her know that i have to be at work in a few hours, so i need to get some rest.

now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* right?

wrong.

i say ""that was great we should do this again sometime""

""i don't think so""

""what why?""

""i don't think my husband would appreciate that""



i am speechless. i don't think i've ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. like, how the fuck did i not see this coming. omg imma home wrecker. i'm probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

me: ""ummmmmmm what? is this an open relationship? does he know where you're at? like, why didn't you tell me that?""

her: ""idk, does it matter?""

""uh yeah, i'd be pretty pissed if i was him""


now i've been cheated on before. and that feeling sucks. i've been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. where i didn't know that i was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. i had found out a couple days later, and i found him on fb and let him know. he thanked me, and didn't get mad at me at all. cheating is the worse thing ever.

so this is where shit starts to hit the fan. i don't remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

her: ""we're getting separated soon""

me: ""well you're still fucking married to him""

""yea but that's okay""

""how is that okay?""

""he's been..... abusive""


there's a slight pause, then she starts crying. so this is where the sober me starts to kick in. this girl is struggling. she's in a bad spot. and no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. and now i'm trying to empathize with this trashy evan williams drinking bitch. like i legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

que the panic attack.

she starts going nuts. ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. knocking shit over. basically trashing my house.

she asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. which i do. she takes it. and calms down. (for the most part).

now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. i tell her that we need to go to sleep. because i have to work in the morning. she tells me ""(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy"" btw, evan williams isn't that bad when you're slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

we finally get to sleep around 4? maybe? i wake up late, she wants round 3. and who doesn't like morning sex. i'm still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. so i gave her a fuck.

anyways, i need to leave for work. but her car is blocking mine. i tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can't because she didn't know where her clothes were. and told me i couldn't move it because ""i didn't know how to drive it"" 

""uhh, this is the third time we've had this conversation. i drive a stick every day, i can move your car""

i move her car. i leave for work. and i just let her stay at my house. i let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. two, i was already running late, and fuck it she'll probably leave before i get home.

a couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. i get concerned, because i'm starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. i came to the conclusion that i should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... but, i see that she had already messaged him. from my facebook account! my computer was still logged into fb when i left, and i didn't think to log out or shut it off or anything.

i tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. he lets me go home. when i get home, i find her still naked in my bed. i get her friend to get her an uber. and i leave. oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

go back to work. thinking everything is over. that's the end of that. wrong again.

i get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. and only that shirt. like vag all out and everything. this girl is afraid to go home. which i'm worried about at this point. because i want her to go somewhere safe. she's refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

oh yea, she had me find her phone. which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. and several others from other people.

she hands me $20 to order a pizza. and after we eat the pizza, she'd uber home. fuckin bet. i ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

i kid you not. i'm sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. and she just opens her legs and says ""make it quick""

this bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and i'm just ready for her to leave.

sex.

after, we're just sitting there, and she starts crying again. asking to go home. and i'm like 

""i'll get you an uber home, but you gotta put pants on""
""no""

""what do you mean 'no'? you can't get in an uber with your pussy out""

""no""


so i gather up all of her belongings and clothes. and try to help her get dressed. to which she refused to allow me to do.

most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... that ""arch"" thing that women do when you're pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#i had the same feeling when i got her panties on.

pizza arrives. i go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. come back inside. panties are off again. god dammit.

we never even opened the pizza box. she's saying that she wants to go home. but is refusing to get dressed. i'm starting to panic myself. because i don't know how i got myself into this situation. but, am me.

she eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that's she having with her husband. and i read through the conversation, it's her sending multiple texts saying ""i'm so sorry babe"" ""idk where i'm at"" ""come get me"". and him saying ""nope sorry"" ""this is on you"" and ""call 911""

that last one though. that's what i did.

before i called 911, i offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because i knew the husband would give her a ride back there. and not to my house. because now i'm starting to worry about my safety. i don't want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. but then again she states that ""you don't know how to drive my car"" with it being a stick and all. even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

i told them that i have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. etc. i tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn't answer.

the ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. this girl is drunk crying. trying to get me to go for yet another round. where at this point, my dick hurts. also, ""girl you need to get dressed, you're gonna be going home""

finally got her panties back on, i didn't tell her that i had called the cops. i told her that the uber was coming. and was trying to get her to put her pants on.

cops show up, i go outside. explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. but i kept my calm. i told them that i was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. but they can't force her to go anywhere she didn't want to. she wanted to go home. officers ask if she was presentable. i pop my head back in the door. she's still wearing my shirt and her panties. so i'm like ""i guess?"", and then i let them in.

she yells ""are you fucking serious? you called the cops?"" 
""uh yea, you didn't wanna leave. even though you said you did. plus your husband said to call 911, so that's what i did""

the officer said to her ""you're on this man's property, and he wants you to leave""

que crying and what not.

cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. which i do. her husband calls her phone, so i accept the call, and then put it up to her face. tell her to tell him what's happening. and that she is getting an uber home. apparently her card and paypal was getting declined for the ride. so she couldn't do it herself. they live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. i live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a lyft/uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... girl finally decides to get dressed.

i had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... i could see the officer's partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. lol.

anyways, i hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she's still wearing mine) to the officer. made sure she had all of her belongings. we get her to walk out of my house to the uber. but she tried to grab the bottle of evan williams. to where i audibly laughed. ""i don't think they'll let you take that""

cops didn't let her take it. she got in the uber and she was gone. policeman handed me the bottle back. where i say ""usually this is the other way around, ha""

po-po leave, i call it a night, and it's over.

flash forward to today. i get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she's asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. i was at work at the time. so i wasn't able to check. but i'm 98% certain i handed those over to the cops. i look for them when i get home. found nothing.

oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

so that brings us to now. i haven't heard anything from her. or the husband. and i'm not sure if it's safe for me to go home. but ya. know what? fuck it. i'm glad i could share this story with y'all. there might be more to come, but you'll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

the moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

jk don't do that.

and don't stick your dick in crazy.

tldr: took a girl home who i didn't know was married. she trashed my house.

edit: i'm not gonna change ""que"" to ""cue"" because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while i deal with mine.

edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2gia

edit 3: her car is still there. can't get it towed, because it's on a public street. i'm still alive. i see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. i'll get to them when i can.

edit 4: fml. i sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. no response. bartender texted me late last night and asked if i used a condom. which many of you have asked.... and no. i didn't. the girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. so i think i may have been baby baited.

edit 5: i'm still not dead. her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor's house. i just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. so i walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it's front of their house... this woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. and she's most likely high on meth. because when i asked her ""hey do you wanna get this car that's in front of your house towed?"" she said ""no, noooo hehe"" i'm like ""yea, i'll talk to y'all tomorrow"" just wtf.

**update**

i've been texting a mutual friend of the couple. apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. i'm in the works of a tifupdate. but i'll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. i'd like to protect the privacy of those involved, but i'm just too lazy to do it right now.",4
i wish i could be ugly for one day.. being ugly every day sucks.,0
"for not wanting to break up with my girlfriend/stepsister?. first of all, i know how that sounds, but it's really not like that.

my girlfriend and i were childhood friends turned high school/college sweethearts. we are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. we are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. the same home. because our parents are married.

it's my mom and her dad. both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. when we were in hs we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and i being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.

honestly, i hate being in this situation. even though i know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says ""go tell your sister x"". i think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. my (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to ""what did you expect from the crazy bitch?"" but i see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. my girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. we can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.

this living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. i love this girl and have spent my life with her. i want to spend the rest of my life with her. i just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.

aita? are we all bad? is it inappropriate no matter what to date your ""stepsister"" who you live with?",3

"my school is demanding for a copy of every students car key. (ga). i found this out about two hours ago. my  high school posted the rule book along with the normal info for the  school year.

in the rule book section about driving to school, it states in bold letter; all students who drive to school using a personal vehicle must give the school a copy of the key or key fob.

after i read this i thought it was a misprint or a mistake. so i called the principal and school board, they both said that it was real and if you park on school property you must follow that rule.

about 30 minutes later i checked the school website and others were complaining  on the forums about it. they went on to post their reason, they want to be able to do random searches or drug sweeps.

i personally find this to be a invasion of privacy. what can i do to stop this?

"one day in the future, donald trump has a heart-attack and dies.. he immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him.
""i don't know what to do here,"" says the devil."" you're on my list, but i have no room for you.

you definitely have to stay here, so i'll tell you what i'm going to do. i've got three folks here who weren't quite as bad as you.

i'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. i'll even let you decide who leaves.""

donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

in it was barack obama and a large pool of water. barack kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. such was his fate in hell.

""no,"" donald said. ""i don't think so. i'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair.
i don't think i could do that all day long.""

the devil led him to the door of the next room.
in it was al gore with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks.
all he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.
""no, this is no good; i've got his problem with my shoulder.
i would be in constant agony if all i could do was break rocks all day,"" commented donald.

the devil opened a third door. through it, donald saw bill clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. bent over him was monica lewinsky, doing what she does best.


donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""yeah man, i can handle this.""


the devil smiled and said..........

"aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why i have missing fingers?. i have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. it's fine. i can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days i can't, that's the dyspraxia). however, i won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. i only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

i'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but i still find it annoying. i really don't get why you'd think it would be an ok thing to ask someone about, but hey. i wasn't raised in a barn. usually i nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

anyway, i started a new job about a month ago, and i honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. i felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and i decided to make myself laugh. when the first new coworker asked about it, i completely lied and told her that i chewed them off as a baby. i then decided to tell the next person who asked that i cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that i was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. all genuinely ridiculous reasons but i'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. i didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. maybe they just thought there's no way i'd lie about how i lost my fingers.

within about 3 days, i learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. i'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3d printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

anyway, i told this story to my brother today and he told me that i was an asshole because i caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. my argument is that i'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because i didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, i was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think i actually severed three fingers with dental floss when i was 3. i'll accept my judgement, though.

update: gonna check out here, i think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. a few reminders for people: i'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",3

"by accidentally getting sexual with my dentist, again.. i'm a 32 year old woman who can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because i'm an idiot. 

my dentist is a very nice and professional man. our first appointment was going pretty smoothly until he made some innocuous remark about us ""being strangers."" my immediate reply was ""oh, you're not a stranger! you've been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!"" i did not intend to make a sexual joke. his face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

i had my second dentist appointment today. i actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. he had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. his face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. i was a bit concerned and also confused. like how could i have embarrassed him this time? i had hardly spoken! so he keeps working in there and then i realize what the hell is happening. my dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. i had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time.

"don't judge your ""market value"" as a romantic partner during your teenage years/ early twenties. a lot of decisions during that time are hormone-driven.. adolescence lasts much longer than most people think, until around 25. before that, the human brain is not yet fully mature, meaning that psychological and behavioural patterns still undergo changes. thus, our ""true personality"" only manifests itself during the late twenties.

before that happens, people are often ""in lust"" rather than in love, but without realizing it. our bodies are wired to produce as much offspring as possible as soon as possible, because early humans used to die young. this can lead to our relationship decisions in high school and sometimes college being based on biological urges rather than compatibility of personalities.

so don't worry if you can't find a partner in high school or even college - the good times are still ahead of you!

i am extremely insecure of my breasts, always have been. because i know they don't look normal. i just want to be confident with my body & feel sexy when i take my shirt off.

i mentioned this procedure to my boyfriend & he immediately shot it down. he says he doesn't want a girl with ""fake boobs"". he won't even listen to me when i tell him how gross my breasts make me feel.

i 100% plan on going through with the surgery. i told my doctor up front that i did not want large breasts, just full breasts & he told me that was absolutely achievable. boyfriend still does not agree. my appointment is in april, the day before mine & my bf's anniversary & 3 days after my 22nd birthday.

please tell me if i'm doing the right thing. is there any way to explain to him how this makes me feel? any advice is appreciated.

"update i have been paying for my entire apartment buildings water heating! and my landlord's response was: ""if you don't like it- just move out!"". here is the original post in case you are not up to date on the situation(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a05jq6/i_am_left_freezing_cold_in_my_apartment_as_i_pay/).

i have managed to uncover (for the most part) the cause of my exceptionally high hydro bills (averaging $400cad a month) in my apartment in ontario, canada.

&#x200b;

based on all of the advice i received from the original post – here's what went down after the comments got locked:

&#x200b;

**i managed to get onto my online hydro account – and discovered some very suspicious activity:**

* i noticed that each month was consistently high usage (every month i was consistently consuming around 2600 kwh. no matter the month – no matter if i was or was not using air-conditioning or heating during the month.
* i also checked the specific weeks where i was on vacation. i was not home at all and everything in the apartment was turned off- i paid around $70 for each week i was away. a total of $140 i paid when i wasn't even home for two weeks!
* furiously, i called the hydro company and asked them to look further – she told me the usage she is seeing is very unusual – it appeared as if the unit is vacant (consistently high consumption without much deviation).
* she also informed me that an inspector would be coming any day now...

**the inspector came to the apartment a few days ago, and accessed the meter (which was in the basement beneath the restaurant):**

* i was in school at this time so my boyfriend was there when the inspector came.
* the inspector noticed that the plumbing in the apartment for the hot water supply feeding each unit (possibly also the restaurant) were combined.
* the closest tank in circuit (mine) was doing all or most of the work for the entire building! feeding hot water to all the units.
* to prove this further, the hydro company closed the cold water intake to our apartment – and we were still receiving hot water! meaning the next closest tank in the circuit (our neighbor) was feeding our hot water.
* also, our hot water tank was feeding the cold water intake of the nearest hydro tank (the apartment next to us).

after emailing the landlord multiple times and waiting days for a response from him – he finally only came because now one of our neighbors was not receiving hot water. we noticed that he was in the basement doing something (probably fiddling around with the plumbing). after he left- we stopped receiving hot water ourselves. i had to shower at the neighbor's house yesterday because of this mess.

&#x200b;

**yesterday my boyfriend confronted the landlord when he came to ""see what's going on.""** *my boyfriend recorded the entire conversation in case we will eventually need it to support our case.*

* instead of getting a professional plumber to come and actually fix his mistakes. he is just poking and prodding at the hot water pipes (literally) and pretends as if he has any idea what he is doing.
* my boyfriend insisted that he get a certified plumber come and fix this massive disaster - and the landlord just complained about money and says that *we* should do it. (as if we haven't already done enough).
* the landlord was just complaining the entire time and even said ""**if you don't like it- just move out!""**

**i am almost certain that the landlord was aware of what was going on with the pluming in the building before we moved in**

* due to the fact that all the tenants before me have dealt with the same high hydro bills and have made complaints before (but they were all old and probably did not know that it was wrong, or what to do – likely my landlords favorite kind of person).
* since my boyfriend and i are having a hard time showering and washing the dishes with no hot water – we turned the hot water back on… meaning at this point we are carrying the entire load for the building again.

**my question to all of you:**

1. what do i do now?... can i trust my landlord to 'solve' this issue on his own – even though his ""plumbers"" will likely be rehired to do the work if we do?
2. what happens to all the money that quite literally went down the drain for this - and is still currently going down the drain?
3. do i need a lawyer?

thanks to all of you again – you have helped tremendously!

&#x200b;

***edit!***

* thank's to all of you who commented last night! - unfortunately the comments got locked before i could even reply to any of you! 
* i am working on contacting some lawyers now  and calling the tenant board on monday!

"my sister caused a scene at mother's day brunch because we didn't honor her as a ""cat mom"". hi guys. i am a man, 32m and i have two sisters - carly (38f) and melinda (26f). we went out to a family style restaurant for brunch and just returned home.

melinda and i are happily married, each with three children. my older sister carly never married. she had a fiance that she cheated on and he left her. that was 10 years ago and she hasn't been in a relationships longer a few months ever since. she has 4 indoor cats and also feeds a few stray cats that hand around her neighborhood.

my mom was very ecstatic because in the last year, my younger sister and i both gave her an additional grandchild. so she gave a speech.

in her speech, she thanked us all for coming and said some flowery lovey stuff and then thanked melinda and my wife for both being excellent mothers to her beautiful grandchildren.

upon hearing my mom praise my wife and my younger sister for being mothers, my sister carly butt in rudely with a loud and irked ""achem!""

she then went on a diatribe about how she is a mom just like they are, and why don't we ever wish her a happy mother's day?

i explained calmly that she isn't a mom at which point, she threw a fork at me and raised her voice in the restaurant ""i am a f*cking mom too you d*mn a**holes! just because i don't have human babies doesn't mean i'm not a f*cling mother too!""

my younger sister tried to calm her down but instead, carly just poured her third glass of white wine into a nearby potted plant, spit at the plant (wtf i know right) and then stormed out.

we thought that we be the end of it, but now she has published a manifesto on her social media calling us small minded and disrespectful and went on to explain why she feels that she is a mother. despite never getting pregnant and giving birth.

we have family and friends calling us on the phone since, asking what happened. i don't know what to tell them other than maybe my sister is showing signs of a nervous breakdown?

i tried texting carly to say ""hi"", but my text came back green (which she has an iphone so it's usually blue). does this mean she blocked me?

anyways i would appreciate any help y'all could give here :/",8
"my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby. really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my gf was raped. it was done in a park. she didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. i couldn't force her, so i just stayed with her.

she was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and i've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. we went to therapy, and she knows i'm there for her. she has a history of depression, and i've been really worried.

last week, we found out she was pregnant. i was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. so the baby definitely isn't mine. she is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

so we had a discussion. she is a devout catholic. we initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

i flat out told her that i would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. she cried and begged me not to leave. i told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and i leave, or she aborts the baby and i stay. i would not let this go.

she didn't want either of those things to happen, so i told her we were done...

i feel shit. was i wrong?",8

"by ruining a vegetarian's love of gummy candy. i like to have some gummy bears at my desk in the morning. because every day is a good day when you start it with gummy bears. i always offer some to anyone who happens to pass through my office. one person in our office is a vegetarian, i am aware of this. they passed by as another person and i were enjoying gummy bears, i quickly began to offer them one and then halfway through my offer i was like ""oh sorry, right! you won't want these!"" 

they responded with ""why wouldn't i?! i love gummy bears!"" i stared awkwardly for a moment before responding with ""well, they have beef gelatin in them."" 

them: ""what do you mean beef gelatin? why would they use that instead of regular gelatin?""

me: ""i thought all gelatin came from animals.""

them: ""are you serious? you aren't serious right? i love gummy bears. my kid and i eat them together all the time."" (kid is vegetarian as well)

me (now panicking): ""i think i am. i don't know. maybe you're right! i'm 
sorry! you're welcome to have some, but the label definitely specifies beef gelatin.""

they now eye my gummy bears with a strange expression of disbelief, longing, anger, and disgust. i swear i could see them going through the stages of grief because i know how sad i would be if gummy bears were ruined for me. so by shattering a vegetarian's blissfully ignorant love of gummy bears.

tl;dr by informing a vegetarian who loves gummy bears that gelatin comes from animals, thus ruining gummy bears for them (and subsequently their child)

edit: omg. front page. all you guys are awesome! and i'm learning so much! i just want to clarify a couple of items. first, this coworker of mine isn't preachy at all or anything. i just happen to know their choice and respect it, i have no idea if it's for health or ethical or sensory reasons or whatever. second, my understanding is that their child chooses to also follow a vegetarian diet but is encouraged to try anything they want, so no forced vegetarianism on the child (yay!). i'm excited about all the dialogue. and feeling a little drunk on the power of knowledge. but pretty please don't bash my co-worker for their dietary choices because, ultimately, it is their choice :)...and they don't judge me for eating candy for breakfast. thanks reddit world!

"pretty sure the 16 year old who lives above us is living alone. is this neglect?. single mom and her daughter live above us (in ct). the daughter is a music student and we constantly have to hear her playing guitar or keyboard with an amp, singing (more like screeching) into a microphone, and producing shitty beats with too much base. 

she plays music way louder than she needs to to practice. its louder than our tv much of the time. her mother usually leaves every night before 8 (if she has been home at all that day) and comes home in the morning to (presumably) shower and then go to work. mother might be home 1 or 2 nights per week.

her daughter obviously takes advantage of this and has friends over. they are so loud some nights that they are clearly drunk. other nights she will sing into a microphone until midnight. they wake us up all hours of the night on weekends and weekdays. the mother complains to us that her apartment smells like weed ""all the time"" and blames it on us, since we are below her. preeeeeetty sure it's her own kid, though, because we don't smoke in or around the house.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4a97dq/my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my_daughter_a/

firstly i would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive pm's i received. it was really overwhelming (in a good way). a few people asked for an update so here it is.

so a lot has happened since i first posted. i called in to work while i was trying to get all this sorted. one of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. my husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. my daughter went to physiotherapy. eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. i was against it but the court ruled against me.

i gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. on her second visit it happened again. this time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. the next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. the neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. they had to cut the brace off my daughter. my husband and his wife were arrested. they got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with cps. my ex lost visitation and custody and i'm working on making it permanent. unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. it set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. she needed surgery and is still recovering. she always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. i hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. right now i'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. that's my update.",2
"there were better female-empowering shows and movies 20 years ago than there are today.. this came up while discussing movies with my sister. i asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry. she said something like ""i'm not sure if they got the roles cuz they're good and female or just because of the latter"" and it really opened my eyes. 

the current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like wonder woman being exceptions). i found terminator, power rangers, castle, etc. way cooler when they made them equals with men and not simply trash them. also, wasn't it more inspiring when women made it big back then? i remember when the chess player judith polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. now, with a separate chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. but i'm digressing.

power rangers vs the new ghostbusters is my point. females were part of the original pr team in almost equal numbers. they usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. that. was. awesome. the new ghostbusters isn't. 

now i'm just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

edit: to answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, i'm not making this up. women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. although this was challenged by judit and now by hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn't getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.",6

"am i in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked?. context. happened a few days ago. me and my boyfriend were staying in a hotel with his friend and his wife (we've been together 3 years). we were all drinking and after awhile his friend and wife left. me and my boyfriend had drunk sex and then went to bed.

after awhile his friend came back alone. my boyfriend got up which woke me up. i was half asleep, and heard the friend say something about my body. my boyfriend asked if he wanted to see. i was on my side away from them and heard them walking over. i panicked and didn't know what to do. was i suppose to jump up and let them know i was listening? freak out? (i have sever anxiety so this caused an attack). i froze and he lifted up the covers i was under. edit: i was naked 

i confronted him the next day but he says i wanted him to see me because i didn't stop him and he should be upset at me but is understanding and i should be too so we can let it go.

am i an asshole? can i not be upset because i didn't stop it?

update: thanks everyone so much for support/ advice. i've been with this guy forever and we were talking about starting to do foster care and marriage. i thought i was crazy and this wasn't as big a deal as i was making it since i wasn't touched or anything. i'd like to make an update after i talk with him again. when you make one do you just add it in here or make a new post? im new to this.

to everyone saying it's ultimately my fault for not doing anything, mental illness is paralyzing. i was sexual abused as a kid and this was the same way my body made me (or wouldn't let me) react. i wasn't sure at first but i know i didn't do anything wrong. 

i'm sorry if it seemed like an obvious answer. it's hard to accept these things when it's someone you had a future with.

more info: i am hesitant to tell the friends wife because they have a baby together. i know she should know the kind of man he is but it makes me think of how i went through divorce but then again would he be a good father to the baby girl anyway?

after the post my so and i decided to get a hotel. when we came back this morning the power was back on. my neighbor told me what happened:

shortly after we'd left, someone in the building called 911 because their son was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion (he's fine now btw). the firefighters were curious as to why the power was off. long story short, after the kid was safe they had a nice talk with the landlord about endangering a child's life to save some money, and she was asked to turn the power back on.

"we should treat all chinese communist party supporters the same way we treat nazi party supporters. the ccp is a totalitarian government hellbent on control through murder, rape, extortion and kidnapping. they are the modern day equivalent of the nazi party in germany.

"two trapped miners once asked for an ipod with the foo fighters music on it to keep their spirits up. after hearing this, dave grohl wrote a note saying ""i want you to know that when you come home, there's two tickets to any foos show, anywhere, and two cold beers waiting for you"".. ",5
"wa my father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). my step sisters father, who has previously never cared about her, is getting full custody and has told me he won't allow me to visit. is there anything i can do?. hi, so my life is falling apart.

as the title says, a few weeks ago my father and my step mother were killed in a car accident. they have been married for 7 years, and my step mother had a daughter from a previous marriage who is 8 years old. i love her unconditionally as if she were my own sister and i would fight tooth and nail to keep her safe.

she has no immediate family other than her father in the area, so he is going to receive full custody of her. i don't know if subjective opinions are allowed in posts like this, but this guy is a fucking asshole. the reason my step mother left him is because he was abusive (which was never reported to the police, but i know several people who have witnessed it first hand, so it absolutely 100% happened), and the reason he was abusive was because my step sister was born and he didn't want a child. as a result, he has never given a shit about her, never asked to see her, and has never wanted anything to do with her until now.

i was at home with my step sister a few days ago and he knocked on the door. i opened it and we had a really ugly conversation about what was going to happen to my step sister now that her mother and my father were dead. i told him that if he did end up having custody i would want to be seeing her as often as possible as i consider her my family. he told me, verbatim ""that's not gonna happen, son. i don't want my daughter spending time with half caste blood."" (he's referring to the fact that my father is mixed race, and that i am too as a result. i slammed the door. i was absolutely livid, which brings me to this post.

so basically, i have a few questions:first, can anything be done to stop him having custody? there are no police reports about his abuse, and his criminal record is clean by all the research i have completed.

third, at the very least, could i contend in a court that i have visiting rights to her? i'm not actually related to her, so i'm not sure what the standing is there.

third, if it's not possible to force allowed visits, is there anyway i can straight up adopt my step sister? i have an office job that pays well, so financial security wouldn't be a problem, i have an apartment of my own, and i would be 100% willing to be her full time guardian.

**edit: i want to make it absolutely clear that my sister does not want to live with her dad, and she says she wants to live with me.**

thank you so so so much to anyone who responds to this. i'm at my wits end and i will do literally anything to keep my step sister close to me, and i don't care about the cost.",2
"for pointing out to my friends that they are not famous?. my friends are dating, they're also actors who have had small roles on a few tv shows (i'm talking two lines or less). i say this not to be a hater, i truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they've got under 1500 followers combined). 

anyway last week i posted a group picture on instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other's shoulders. very platonic. 

anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don't want ""the public"" to know they are dating. i would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don't. also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. 

anyway i asked what they meant, and they said they didn't want to end up in gossip rags....

i pointed out that they are not famous and that they don't even have functioning imdb pages. they were livid and called me a bunch of names. 

i think they're delusional but they've been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). at this point, i don't even want to be their friend. however, and probably because i'm an asshole, i don't want to delete it based solely on principle.

"for making an obese man pay me cash to take up part of my seat on a long flight?. so this month i was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which i had booked and seats selected for. i specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat — just the aisle and window. 

well, a very obese man boards and i can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. i assume maybe he bought two hence why he's even attempting to board. i'm mentally crossing my fingers he's not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. 

i get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. i sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. after a minute, i decided to be upfront and tell him:

""sir, i'm sorry but this situation is not working for me, you're taking up quite a bit of my seat"". 

he wasn't rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there's not nothing he can do — although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. it just wasn't enough, though. he still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. i'm talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. 

i end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. she instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. she goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren't any open seats on this flight, so there wasn't a way to move people so he could have two. this causes a very awkward silence. 

the guy seemed embarrassed and didn't want to get up. he mentioned how he can't wait for a later flight. i felt bad for him but i was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight — the comfort i paid for. the flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he'll need to book another flight. the guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here's where i made my offer. 

i told the guy, ""look, i'll put up with this if you give me $150 — that's half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.""

he instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. he even told me he appreciated it. 

well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn't volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. i just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. 

from my perspective, i gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and i was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person's body pressed against you involuntarily). a win-win. he wasn't angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. 

after the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but i ignored them. this leads me to beg the question, aita? ",3

"exwife is going off the deep end. this is in nj, usa. can i do anything here?. i get my daughter every other weekend. she's 9 years old and her mother bought her a cell phone, obviously to keep tabs on my daughter. 

this weekend, we were watching a movie when i got a text from my ex wife asking to speak to my daughter. 

now, i don't attach myself to my phone (unless i'm working) and i got the text about 30 minutes after it came through. 

when i saw it, i told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and i also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that i told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

the movie ended around 9:10 pm and i had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. i told her i'd be up to tuck her in. 

i went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. 

he mother was screaming into the phone ""you tell him fuck you! you can say that! i say its ok for you to tell your father fuck you!!""

i took the phone from my daughter and i said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

she yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn't true at all. 

i asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. my ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

i handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear ""daddy is going to leave the room now, please don't stay on the phone long, it's way past your bedtime."" (bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was saturday night so i bent the bedtime a bit). 

i had to get my stepson to bed (he's a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

i walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she's repeating ""i'm sorry"" into the phone. i fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

i walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

it wasn't until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. she had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

i sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. she was really upset and wouldn't speak much. i hugged her. my daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. 

i'm sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. divorce is hard enough on children, and i think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be.

"my (19f) boyfriend (22m) was taking secret nudes and sending them to his friends group chat. i've been dating this guy for about a year now. it's not a long time, i know, but i felt like we really connected and stuff like it feels like we've been known each other our whole lives or something. i sound so stupid, i know. i just really trusted and loved him. a lot. i trusted him with my life. a year cmon 

i went on his phone when he was in the shower to search something up because mine was in the other room and he got some notifications of his friends group chat and they were saying stuff like she's so hot, you're so lucky etc so i was naturally curious and disgusted to find out that they were looking at a video of me that my boyfriend secretly took while i was giving him a blowjob. i am pretty conservative, my parents don't even know that i'm not a virgin, and i have sex with my boyfriend and all that but he knows i do not do pictures because i don't want them to get out and have my reputation ruined, my parents would literally kill me. i remember him on his phone, i asked him what he was doing and he said he was just checking something and then he put it away. i never fucking thought that he was taking a video 

i feel so disgusted i can't even describe the feeling in my stomach like i want to throw up and take a shower and rip my skin off. all these pictures and videos he'd taken of me during sex like quick blurry pictures when my back is turned or short videos like during doggy when i'm not looking at him. i just feel so fucking gross. and who sends that to their friends??? that's so weird!!! you're sending videos of you having sex to your ""bros"", that is so fucking weird. and the other guys would throw in pictures and shit too but those girls were happily posing for the camera and seemed like they knew what was happening 

i cannot even believe he would do this to me. i was still on his phone when he came back from the shower and he quickly grabbed it from my hand and said i was invading his fucking privacy. seriously??? your privacy feels invaded right now??? you clueless asshole. i just started yelling at him and honestly i'm not proud of it but i started hitting him and grabbed his towel. he was acting like i was overreacting and he started hitting me back. are you fucking serious, these guys all have videos and pictures of me and who knows who they showed them to or if they put them online or sold them for money. he started saying some bullshit how his friends think i'm so hot and they just compliment me and it's nothing bad. and you're not gonna believe this... he said they kept pressuring him to contribute to the group chat and he knew i was way too respectable to agree to it so he had to take the pictures and shit behind my back literally. he wasn't even saying sorry and said it was really flattering and they all think i'm so hot  

what kind of a betrayal. i wish this bitch cheated on me or fucked my best friend or dumped me over text or something not as bad as this. i have no idea how many people have seen me naked and having sex at this point and i just wanna step out of my body and throw this one out. i feel so fucking exposed like i saw those videos, i had no idea what was going on, in my head i was thinking about how much i love him and how happy i was and look at what this bitch was doing 

and he texted me afterwards saying we both lost control and we should just say sorry and move on and he'll stop doing it. and he said he was really hurt that i'd take his towel and leave him in a vulnerable state like that and he'd be waiting for my apology. he is so fucking clueless i don't even know what to say",8

"update my gf likes me to go by different names.. tl;dr: most of you were right, she was sleeping with matt.


here is  a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9x4b5s/my_gf_likes_me_to_go_by_different_names/


i want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who responded. 

after i made my post, i waited 2 days to say anything to her because i wanted to get as much input as possible. i also took that time to prepare myself to separate.

i started reading comments right after i posted. i replied to a few but after so many telling me that she was cheating on me with me, i started to feel sick. i called my boss to ask for friday off for personal reasons. i spent the day driving around, looking for potential apartments. we don't live together but i wanted to make sure if things went bad, she'd have a harder time finding me. we also have some good memories in that apartment and i think i would be sad if i had to continue to live there. 

this brings us to saturday, the day i promised myself i would say something. i invited her over for breakfast but instantly regretted it because i was getting so nervous that i completely lost my appetite. she walked in the door and instantly knew something was different. i was hoping to ease into it, but i ended up blurting out, ""i met matt blank"". she tried to act casual about it, but i could tell she didn't expect me to know about him. for the next 3 or so minuted things were calm, i talked about how i see the past 4 months completely differently. she started to cry and say she was sorry, i don't mean some tears but full on ugly crying. i told her i'm going to work on forgiving her, because if i don't i think it will eat me up inside. i won't forget what happened but i'll at least try to move on. she started to talk about how she'll work on building my trust again. i interrupted her by saying that that isn't necessary, as we were no longer together. 

if i wasn't so emotionally crushed, i would have been amazed at the transition. she started begging me to give her another chance. i stood up and went to my room to grab a few boxes of all the gifts she gave me. i told her that i had already made up my mind to break up with her. after some back and forth, she realized that i was serious. i knew the exact moment she knew i was serious because she went from crying to yelling. it started off with insults and when that didn't work she tried throwing the truth in my face to hurt me. it started off that i was fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, and i had a useless job. in the middle of her tirade, she said matt's dick was way bigger than mine.

as she was yelling at me, she ended up saying what happened between the two of them. i'll summarize below:

she started sleeping with matt 3 years ago, they were on some sort of work trip and ended up drunkenly sleeping together. from there it went from once in a while to once a week. matt called things off 4 months ago because he met a girl. i think she was using the vacations because she missed being with matt. 

i don't really remember the rest of saturday. i spent sunday with my friends which helped, i told them what happened which was nice to get off my chest. i went to work as normal yesterday, at some point in the day she slipped a note under my door. i'm not sure what it said because i burned it. ",8
"for being honest with my nephew about where i was for most of his life?. okay, let me just get right into this. i 27m was kicked out at 16 because my older sister 37f outed me to my parents as gay. they completely cut off all contact with me and i didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. when i was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. for the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

a couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and i ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. he asked me why i wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. i asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. i told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until i eventually confessed i was cut off for being gay. he made a face and asked how my parents even found out. i told him i was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that i don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. he got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

i got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that i'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". i explained to her that i didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and i think he's old enough to deserve honesty. she just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. i'm crushed because obviously i love the kid. did i do the wrong thing? should i have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",3

hey guys, and update has already been posted here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccpwcu/update_mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am/). please don't message me so angrily any more.

update 2:

sorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.

nothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. regardless, i think i will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.

my sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and i have her support.

i promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now i need to support my grandma.

thank you again to everyone.

update:

sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but i chickened out half way through what i had to say :(

the good news is that i am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

thank you for all your support, everyone, i will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

my grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

i will let you know how i manage.

thank you again.

pretty much the title. i have no idea how to process all this, and i am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

both my older brother and sister went to the same college. my brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. both had their college paid by our dad. dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

my brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

my sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

i got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. i always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

instead i was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how i am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. he said it was never is place to say anything since i am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

apparently my grandparents know i am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

my siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as i am because there was never a hint of anything being off. i might be naive, but i always thought i had a great relationship with my dad. we go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when i had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. i never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. i mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. it's a story he tells from time to time. he likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

my mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

i feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. i am not even sure i will be able to go to college any more, i always assumed my parents will pay for it. i never had a job, and i am not sure what job i can even get to support me through college, i have no idea how to apply for loans.

all my mom has done is cry and apologize. but nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

i don't even know if i am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, i feel shame leaving my room, and if i will be asked to move out i don't know where to go. i don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

i am angry at my mom, i am confused about where i stand with my dad. there's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. i feel rejected and i have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

anyone have any idea what to do here?

do i apologize to my dad? what do i say to him?

idk, i've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. i have no idea what to do.

edit: comments are coming in faster than i can reply, but i am making a list with all the advice about financial aid, health insurance, getting my own phone plan, etc, things i didn't even think about before. thank you everyone.

i will try to answer as much as i can, but there's more comments than i can handle.",8
"by blowing my load absolutely everywhere during a massage. so this actually happened almost four years ago now and will need just a little back-story.

i visited thailand in september '15 as part of a (still on-going) trip around the world, this was via a tour group and so, to keep the budget low, we were often put into shared rooms. this meant that trying to jerk off was a little bit of a problem, and i never felt ok jerking off in shared bathrooms/showers, so i decided to just not bother for the duration of the trip. i was there for a month and this happened during week three, so you can imagine, my cajones were a little heavy by this point and my libido was getting just a tad ravenous.

one morning whilst enjoying the sporadic sun between the monsoons on koh samui, i decided to strip down to by boxer shorts and plunge into the warm ocean instead of heading back to my room and changing into my swimming shorts. after a little splash around i used the outdoor shower to wash the saltwater off and put my sweatpants on with no underwear, i didn't think much of it. i then proceeded to drink a fairly decent amount of beer and gorged myself on plates of delicious pad thai.

i suffer from ongoing back pains, so when i hit thailand i took full advantage of their cheap massage houses. now, considering how vulgar my username is, i am actually bit of a prude. i didn't want any ""rug and tug"" situations, in all honesty it just does nothing for me once i start visualising how many other dicks those hands have played around with you know? not that i'm chastising anyone who does enjoy that, its just not my cuppa tea. so, after being a little drunk and full of food i decided to go to a nearby massage parlour and to get my near-daily full-body rub down.

this wasn't one of those sleazy parlours you see dotted around everywhere, not a hint of neon lighting or blacked out windows, it was small and a tad ramshackle but was obviously a classier establishment. i went in and there was one woman working, it was otherwise entirely devoid of anyone else. i asked for the same as always, paid up in advance (in case she thought i was after anything ""extra"") and got ready. it was only when i started taking my sweatpants off that i remembered that i was free-balling, i explained to the lovely young lady my dilemma and offered to just roll up my trousers but she just handed me an extra towel and turned around whilst i awkwardly positioned myself on my stomach with a towel under me and another over my arse.

the first half of the massage went well, it was actually one of the best ones i'd had by this point, she seemed to pinpoint a lot of my knots and just went to town on them (i'm a big fan of more aggressive massages), i was in absolute bliss. then came the time for the front. look, by this point i had been massaged by young women, elderly women, flamboyantly gay men, miserable old men, lady-boys and everything in-between, in every single instance each one of them had ""awoken the beast"" to some level or another. with this massage i was at absolute full-mast. one of those ""i've not jerked off in three weeks"", my dick actually aches type of stonkers. i apologised profusely because no towel in the world was gonna hide that particular beast. she laughed and started working on my legs, i started relaxing a bit more, i imagined it was nothing she hadn't seen before (my dick is a bit overweight but not particularly long) and tried to settle back down and enjoy it. she went up the thigh and nudged by nuts with the kind of delicate touch i imagine a pixie would have, my helmet popped out from under the towel in an almost mocking manner. i went to pull the towel back up a little more but she did as well and in doing so managed to stroke just the tip of my cock.

cum fired out of my dick with such ferocity that i thought i'd broken something, a load of it shot on her hand, a lot went all over my chest but i also decided to try and sit up at the same time and another hot wad of baby batter shot itself all over the massage bed, the floor and on her forearm. all the while i'm desperately trying to apologise, mopping up my seed whilst still emptying both barrels in a confusing mixture of ecstasy and despair. mostly despair. after a short while, the fireworks were over. there was a pregnant pause, she looked neither angry or sad, just a little bewildered. i realised that i'd been using both her fresh towels to mop up my mess and was just this gollum-esque, butt-naked creature awkwardly perched on her massage bed, covered in cum and probably reeking of alcohol who up until recently had been screaming apologies in-between the occasional gasps of joy. wordlessly i put my clothes on, not making eye contact, i pulled my wallet out and gave her about 1500 baht (the massage cost 200 to put that into perspective) and slowly slunk out. i often wonder if she talks about this absolutely fucked up situation.

edit - typos  


edit 2 - after desperately trying to reply to as many of the posts as i could, i received a notification that i'd hit the front page. so, i guess its gonna take me a while longer than anticipated to get back to y'all, i still need to work too. in all honesty, i wrote up this event because i had been told i had to during one of the many times i have regaled people with it. i had spent all day yesterday just writing incredibly downbeat stuff and decided to take a break and to quickly scribble up something a little more jovial, more for myself than anything else, thinking that it would maybe make a few people chuckle and was pretty harmless, so i posted it typos and all. i did not ever expect this response, its really lifted my spirits and i am grateful beyond words. every little complement and giggle is doing more good than i think most people would realise. thank you.

"by picking up a hitchhiker and then showing up to my own funeral. this happened a few years ago and i was living in zimbabwe at the time, and i was having a pretty bad day, i was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. if youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. so i got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so i do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
i get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....then i here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so i wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. so i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

i explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where i am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). i start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so i pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and i dont have the best memory so i didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch i let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which i thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, i take down his number so i can repay him later on. at this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, i walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. im about 100 feet from the house and i see my son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. i get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like ive been gone for months. my auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

i still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and i see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


so it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what i had stumbled upon.
my son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

tl;dr got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and i somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

"by forgetting babies exist.. so i've been spending a lot of time around dogs. i've recently been hired by friends families and family friends to walk or watch their dogs. my reddit is covered in dogs from various sources. my facebook is solely dog pages and dog-related charities. basically everywhere i turn, i see dog. not a bad life to live. until yesterday (yifu i know). i walked one of my mother's friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. it wasn't very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. it's hot. i've just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. i want to blame dehydration for this fu, but really i know i'm just an idiot. a couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. my first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. i don't know. it's a hot day and i've seen dogs in pushchairs before. maybe they didn't want its paws on hot tarmac. maybe they're just a little extra. regardless, the thought that babies exist didn't enter my tiny stupid brain. as they got up to leave and walk by me, i decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words ""what breed is it?"" and gestured towards the pushchair. they looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. it was a baby. a human baby. i'm so glad they took the traditional british approach of confused stare and silence. if they had said something i think i would have disintegrated on the spot. it was a long walk home after that and thankfully, i didn't pass anymore pushchairs. 

tl;dr i asked a woman what breed her baby was after seeing one too many dog on the internet.",4

"by saying the worst possible thing in a restaurant. this happened a few hours ago in a busy buffet restaurant in a hotel in austria.

being a buffet restaurant, people were pretty much always wandering from table to food and back again, so there was a constant steam of mainly austrian and german people passing our table. we've been here a few days, you start to recognise people and my two young sons have made a few friends.

i was joking with the kids  that i'd left their nintendo switch at home, they suspected i was joking but went along with it anyway. so when i told them i had brought it they wanted to check.

""i brought it,"" i said 

""our switch?""

""yes, our switch""

""what?!! our switch?!""

""yes!! our switch!!""

they got louder and we started just repeating it, laughing. i noticed my wife frowning at me, or past me, it didn't really register.

""our switch?""

""our switch! ha!""

then my wife really started signalling to me to shut up - i was like ""it's ok... it's a buffet""

""our switch! ha!""

""our switch!""

then my wife leaned in and urgently whispered ""it sounds like you are all shouting auschwitz""

my whole body went cold with the realisation.

needless to say i immediately stopped, placed my hand on my eldest son's knee and he - seeing the look on my face-  stopped straight away - the 3 year old did one final shout before i could stop him... 

i have avoided eye contact with all other hotel guests since. 

tldr: shouted ""auschwitz"" loudly, happily, repeatedly,  in a restaurant full of germans and austrians. i'm really sorry.

edit: thank you for the gold and silver kind strangers! my first. to those calling bs: i wish it was. to the genial germans and austrians assuring me of the reduced risk of horror due to pronunciation, sincere thanks - i will sleep better tonight because of you. and for the few offended at us shouting in a buffet: it's a kinderhotel. kind of like if michael bay did buffets.

edit2: just to all my salty comrades telling me i'm a ""scum cunt"", that my kids will grow up to assholes because we were loud. i fucking love you reddit! i'm reassured that you are all so considerate when it comes to noise in public spaces. you wouldn't like this restaurant ... stone walls, stone floors, a hotel designed for kids. it's like a school playground where they've all been given metal objects to smash together but louder. our risky exchange was lost in the cacophony to anyone who wasn't walking past our table..",4

"update this man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, i have a specific question regarding something i want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it.. i would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). sorry for not updating you right away as i was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

so here's what happened. i liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone's day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. so i hired a guy which i'll call him frank.

after waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid's drone and frank's drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

a few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom i recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. we went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. shockingly he was completely understanding. he told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both frank and i a settlement if i agree not to sue. i called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed frank for his drone plus way more money that i would've ever paid him. he also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that i wont pursue any legal action.

it was a happy ending and i was quite shocked of his father's reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but i must admit that i feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. never have i felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. while we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! so the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like ""mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and i'll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away"".",2

i was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. my aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. i explained why exactly i didn't feel good about giving her leyla's social security number. they both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn't see anything wrong with it.

after explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn't have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. we ended up working out a compromise - my wife and i opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. everything seemed to have worked out well.

yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from romania. she had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. she said it completely justified my hesitation. her information was stolen in the equifax breach a couple of years ago.

texted my ex later on monday asking if she deleted my thesis and didn't hear back. her friend called me in tears saying my ex deleted everything and feels incredibly sorry and guilty. she did it because she saw me flirting with someone at the party and got jealous.

"for insisting if i can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?. throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

so i 20m live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend 23f, a guy from my uni course 20m and his cousin 26f. for the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. however this has been a real point of contention lately. 

about six months ago i began a relationship with a guy i've known for a couple of years 21m. i know it's still a fairly new relationship but i really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. this was mostly due to the fact that i have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch tv and get takeout or cook together. i didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10pm because of his work schedule. 

so the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that i need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". i asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". i pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. she said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. i confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. i asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. i pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

my potential assholery: i've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  if i answer the door to anyone's partner i'll send them away. if i come home and someone's partner is there i'll make a point to mention that i thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. i've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me i'm being unreasonable. i know i'm being petty, but i think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and i'm trying to make that point. am i really the asshole here?

eta: some questions people keep asking: 
1. if i knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something i'd have included it. i'm not aware of anything he does and when i ask why 26f doesn't like him i just get a shrug and ""just do"". i will also state i'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners i've had. 
2. we don't hang out in the living room much. we literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that i can't get on my bedroom tv and there's nobody else in there. we use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. a lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26f, *not* my best friend. my best friend is 23f. not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago i was moving out of halls at university and 23f was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. at the same time, a dude from my course - 20m - was looking for a flatshare. we couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26f - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. i only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.
4. by chronic fatigue i mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",3
"update: for shutting down all black names because i think it'll make my son's life harder?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/

i posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and i were having with our baby's name. we had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. my husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black american culture. i wanted a more neutral name since i am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. we found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. his name will be....

miles trayvon

we thought it was a perfect compromise. my husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be ""tray"" to most of them. when he's in school his name will just be listed as miles (last name). he can officially be miles t. (last name) if he doesn't want to use trayvon but he can also easily go by trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. this option gives him the choice, which my husband and i agreed was important. my husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. he talked about how in 8 mile eminem's character says something like, ""this guy's a gangsta? his real name is clarence."" that's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. he's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.

i had the opposite experience. my mom is white and my dad is black. they decided on a stereotypical black name and i think it made my life harder. professional i go by a nickname and i do personally as well. when talking about it with my husband i realized it started early. i remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. a woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma i was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. instead of saying my real name my grandma said, ""her name is daisy."" i attended an hbcu and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. for example, raquan smith would put ""ray smith"", demarcus jones would put ""marcus jones"", keshawnda nelson would put ""shawna nelson"", etc. they said you had to play within the system and i did that.

anyway, sorry for the long update. i just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. we didn't really get deep into it until after i posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. before anyone says it, i do realize some people will connect trayvon to trayvon martin. that's not why we are using it. i posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but i don't mean to offend anyone. it's a family name on my husband's side.

edit: thanks for all the dms but please stop sending me articles about the woman named marijuana pepsi and the black spider-man named miles. thanks y'all.",3

"for ruining jeans for women?. i work at an office where i'm allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the ""no jeans policy."" she frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

problem is, for the past few months that i've been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. that is, until a few days ago. 

i love wearing jeans, and have always felt i could make them professional too. i was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. she said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

i said ""well, the girls get to wear jeans.""

""no they don't.""

then, my coworker, amanda walked in wearing jeans. i pointed that out. my manager confronted amanda, telling her that she wasn't allowed to wear jeans. 

in the moment, amanda appeared playfully mad at me. but i went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but i think she may actually be mad. i apologized, saying i didn't want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

aita?

edit/ update: wow, did not expect all of the responses, though i can't say i'm surprised about the polarization. at work today, it wasn't bad. only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. i do feel bad that i ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day i will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",3
"by unwrapping a condom. so this happened earlier in the week but is nsfw so posting on the weekend. also on my throwaway acc. since i don't want this story going back to the irl me.

so at uni as apart of their safe sex promotion, we get given condoms in our ""welcome to uni"" packs for students who live in the university-run accommodation. i'd always chucked these in my drawer for ""future use"" if the situation requiring them ever arose. it never has and so i took them home over summer and they've been sitting in my drawers at home ever since.

anyway, i'm on intersemester break right now so i (19m) was back home, and poking around in my old stuff found some of them. i decided i'd open the wrapper since i'd never actually used one before or tried putting one on (parents took me out of sex-ed for religious reasons), and i thought it might be good to try one on and try out masturbating with it, so promptly opened the wrapper.

as i discovered, and the majority of the sexually active population probably know, condoms come kind of lubed already and for whatever reason i took a smell since i could kind of tell it smelt weird.

when i did this, i realised that i had not only smelt this scent before, but knew exactly how it tasted. i have memories of chewing on uninflated balloons quite a lot when i was younger (same with rubber bands) and the one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that. except now i realise it *wasn't* a balloon and was in fact, a used condom. i felt pretty sick then.

i wish i could delete memories and that i'd never remembered/realised this.

tl;dr  got out a condom to try it out, realised i've tasted condoms before.

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of people are asking how my parents use both contraception but also took me out of sex-ed. i have no idea how to label their breed of christian but it's definitely not catholic. i think it's something like evangelical or baptist or nondenominational.

i think the reasons for taking me out of sex ed was to shelter me from learning about sex in a non-religious context, such as not being constantly taught that ""pre-marital sex is sin, homosexual sex is sin, oral sex is sin, masturbating is sin, etc."" i'm also from new zealand, not north america as a few have assumed. here it's taught in year 9 and 10 (ages 13-15) which they decided was too early for me, although they never gave me ""the talk"" either.

the ""balloon"" was also found under my parents bed, not in a drawer.

thank you for the awards, i wish they could make me forget, at least there is a small positive now from fake internet points.",4
"i 22f read my parents' texts and found out my immediate family pretty much despises me.. i honestly don't even know where to start here... i haven't lived at home for the past four years of undergrad because i function better when i'm not around my family all the time.  i think and function differently from them, which is something i thought was ok and not a source of conflict until this morning.  i'm moving in a month for grad school so i moved back home for the summer to save a bit of money.  the entire summer both my siblings and my parents have been very nasty (mostly in the way of exclusionary and passive aggressive behavior) towards me despite minimal confrontation or conflicts occurring.  it's been really upsetting but i've tried to push it aside.  i've heard them talking about me behind my back on multiple occasions and even seen text messages over my sister's shoulder between her and my mom calling me disgusting and really just trashing me in any way they know how.

i am aware that what i did was wrong / i shouldn't have done it, but my dad went to the grocery store and left his phone at our house.  everyone else was sleeping and morbid curiosity got the best of me, so i opened it (he doesn't have a passcode) and went through he and my mother's texts together.  i don't know what exactly i was expecting to find, perhaps a few sparing texts about me, i don't know, but i was completely shocked to find that the majority of their conversations are about how much they despise me.  like this is to the point where they purposely plan family lunches/dinners/movie nights/etc when they *know* i am working or otherwise busy and invite me even though they know i can't go so that it's not obvious they don't want me in attendance.  i'm not even worthy of a name in their conversations, as my dad merely refers to me as ""the bitch"" and my mother follows suit.  my mom says things like ""it's so funny how she acts like her life is so great but she can't be genuinely happy because she is the most miserable bitch i have ever met.""  they say i bring down the mood, i walk into the room and i'm a bitch, etc.

there are also several texts where my dad will message my mom complaining about how annoying i'm being and she will respond saying my sister and brother are also texting her the same thing and they'll laugh about it.  so while i'm in the room with my entire family, they are texting about how insufferable i am.

i think the worst thing of all is that my sister outed me to my entire family.  i came out to her in december after being closeted for years and it was a very huge step for me to do this as my family is not very supportive of the lgbtq+ community and i was terrified to tell anyone.  i told her i wasn't ready to share this information with anyone and she turned around and told everyone in my family about it.  they are ""sickened"" by my ""lifestyle"" and have no issue with her mistreating me because she disagrees with my ""lifestyle"" (yes, that is what they are calling it).

growing up i was always straight-laced, kept my head down, and did what i was supposed to.  i am good in school and got involved with community service/volunteering and excelled in varsity sports.  i've also worked since i was fourteen.  i pay for all of my expenses and never ask for a thing from my parents.  in college i had a 4.0 and i got into multiple top phd programs straight out of undergrad.  i won multiple prestigious awards in undergrad whose ceremonies both my parents never bothered showing up at.  i am the black sheep and they abuse me for it.

i know snooping was wrong and i'm not sure what i expected to find doing something like this but damn, this hurts like hell.  i've always felt generally ostracized and sort of disliked by my family but i tried to tell myself that it was just my anxiety going into overdrive and brushed it off.  but these were not mere hunches, they are true.  i feel sick to my stomach and absolutely numb, and i'm honestly not sure how i should proceed from here.  should i try to bring things up with my family?  should i just bide my time for the next few weeks until i move?

tldr: i knew my family was talking about me behind my back so i read my parents' texts and found horrible messages about me and also found out that my sister outed me to my family.

**edit:** thank you so much everyone for the outpour of support, kindness, and advice.  i initially really just needed to get this off my chest and find a soundboard in the reddit community but you all have rallied and helped me significantly.  i am trying my best to respond to your numerous comments, messages, and pms offering support and love but there are a lot to go through so please know i see you and appreciate you very much!

some people have shared that i've come across as very superior- and pretentious-sounding in the comments.  i want to apologize for that and express that this was not my intention.  i was simply trying to share that i've had multiple achievements that i would like to *share* and *celebrate* with my family, but instead they seem to scorn me for them.  success should be shared amongst families, not be a divisive factor!

**edit 2:** just going to answer a few of the common questions i'm seeing in the comments here.

* yes, my family is religious.  they are catholic.  i am not religious but keep quiet about this and still bow my head in prayer at supper and participate in everything they would like me to.
* no, i do not spew my political beliefs to them or anywhere near them.  in fact, i hardly talk politics.  i do not post my views on social media or engage in political discourse on social media.  when my parents are talking politics, i merely listen respectfully and offer no opposition to what they have to say.  i pick my battles, and politics / religion are not battles i prefer to have.
* yes, i have friends.  no, my relationships outside my immediate family are not negative.  i generally get along well with others at work, school, and in social environments.
* my relationship with my extended family is positive and healthy.
* no, i am not adopted.

**edit 3:** copying and pasting a response to a comment on the thread.  a lot of people are confused about how much my family's mistreatment of me ties into my queerness.  here's a bit more context that i definitely should have provided earlier:

the issues with my sister started after i came out to her! this is definitely something i should have clarified, i'm sorry. here's the story:

i was dating this really awesome girl in december who has been out and proud since middle school. i was falling for her and realized that it wasn't fair to her to have to be dating someone in the closet, so i decided it was time to start taking steps towards being out. i figured baby steps were the way to go, so i started with my sister. my sister and i have told each other a lot of private information in the past and i thought i could trust her with this. i was initially hesitant to tell her because she has made ignorant homophobic comments in the past and casually uses slurs such as ""dyke"" and sees no issue with it. however, one of my good friends told me that her family was the same way and when she came out they realized how horrible their behavior had been, felt awful about it, and apologized profusely. so i figured that if my sister knew about me, maybe she would realize the weight of her unkind words. i told her and she was definitely surprised/caught off guard by it and acted a little awkward. but after that nothing happened and no mention was made of it. she began just acting a little stiff and awkward around me which over the course of several months has escalated into resentment and bullying. now mind you, my parents have been resentful and harsh towards me for the past several years, but my siblings at least usually had my back and i felt like i had some support with them. but once i came out to my sister, things slowly started to change.

in early july, we were at our cousins' house and i was in the bathroom. the house is small with thin walls and i overheard a conversation in which my sister and brother were expressing their disgust towards me because of my sexuality. so i realized at that point that my sister had outed me to my brother and now to my cousin. at this point i realized that she was really betraying my trust and clearly didn't care much for my privacy and well-being, but i still didn't think she would tell my parents, knowing their thoughts and opinions on gay people. well, she did. i'm not sure when exactly, but in their text messages they were excusing her mistreatment of me because they understand that she does not agree with my ""lifestyle.""

i'm going to paste this comment in a third edit on my main post because a lot of redditors are confused at lacking context. well, here is some more. this situation is complex and something i am struggling to make sense of myself, so before you make an unkind comment calling me things such as a ""bitch,"" a ""whore,"" and a ""cunt,"" among other slurs, please realize that i am in the dark here as well.",8
"for i telling my childhood bully (who is mtf transgender) that she will always be the ""boy who bullied me""?. when i was a in middle school, i was viciously bullied by this boy, who i'll call z. he spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. 

it's been 12 years, and z has since come out as mtf transgender. she messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. we went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. it was along the lines of, ""i'm sorry for being mean. i was young, and i was struggling with my gender identity.""

i thanked her for her apology. when she asked if she was forgiven, and i tried to avoid answering. i am still not over what she did to me. what z did to me impacted me greatly, as i was a impressionable young girl. i struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

z started getting defensive. she told me that i was being petty and that i should forgive her. i told her, ""why? you will always be the boy that bullied me.  an apology won't change that."" she got really offended when i said the word boy, and said that i was misgendering her. she called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out.

i'd like to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. your advice helped prepare me for what came next.

&#x200b;

pretty soon after i posted, i received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. i knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so i googled the law firm and lawyer's name. i couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so i reached out to them. the letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. they asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. i don't know exactly what's happening as i have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&#x200b;

in other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that i also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. we still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

"if i report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to hr for basically slut shaming me?. i've \f21\ recently encountered a new sexual partner. we used a condom, but after words i felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time i have ever hooked up with someone i just met. my previous sexual partners have all been someone i have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. while condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a sti, it cannot provide absolute protection. a few days ago, i noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an std. i have never had one before and i have no idea the symptoms, but an std was all i could think about. 


i went to an urgent care because i wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or uti) and if not, i wanted to send my urine off for an std screening.  my doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which i was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


it came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. she says based on my symptoms, i am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and std screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


as i'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" i sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""with all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". i looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". at this point, i was pretty fucking angry. you could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. i thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

i was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn i get slut shamed for it? i posted this in a forum about sexual education and i was getting advice to report her to hr. i don't want to go after anybody's job, but i don't want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

will i be the asshole if i report her to hr or should i leave it alone?

edit: for everybody asking, i was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. i just kind of stared at her because i immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information i shared with her so openly. so after a couple of seconds she said ""i appreciate your openness and honesty tho"" (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so i just said ""thanks"" and left. i was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. trust me, i wish i would have but i wasn't even thinking about going off on her. i was just embarrassed. 

also, she was a nurse practitioner. i know a couple of times i referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was np. 

and for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that i'm having more fun than u 😘


update

before i start off with the update, i want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) i am not heartless, and in the original post i even directly said i did not want to go for her job. that was never my intention and i even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you're obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. i also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody i just met, so ""closing my legs"" or ""quit being easy"" doesn't fucking apply. in game if thrones, every single ""whore"" had one thing in common and that's that they enjoyed sex. so if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) for teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. what you decide to do with your body is really nobody's business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

now to the update: 
i called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or np supervisor. they didn't have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the nps was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

first and foremost, i explained to the manager that i in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. i did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or pip to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

i explained to her everything that happened and before i could even say who the np was, she knew exactly who i was talking about...which confirmed that she's most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

i then explained how i confided in her and that i came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. i explained that her words didn't hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers and future interactions with her other women patients. 

the lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she'd ""call the doctor (her supervisor)"" right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. she also said she was placing a note and that the np wouldn't be back in the office until next monday. 

with all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! you've truly been so helpful. 

and for the people calling me a slut for this, i hope to god this same thing doesn't happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",3
"i 17/m glanced over my shoulder at my girlfriend 17/f going though all her messages, and i saw hearts and ""i love you"" to her best guy friend.. is it normal, or am i just overanalyzing things. she text me different, usually with less funny pictures and more meaningful statements. here's the kicker though. he calls her cutie. he's told me in person that he's interested in her. he calls her cutie over text. now, obviously i can't just outright tell her anything, because then she'll know i caught a glance. she said i love you to him in person, while we were holding hands, so i guess it's normal. i'm just trying to get some other opinions.

edit one: wow, thanks everyone, seriously. i talked to her just before we left school, we ride separate buses. she was very quiet, and spoke very softly, which usually means she's distressed. i told her how it would feel if it was a girl best friend calling me cutie. she agreed with me, i think. i told her how uncomfortable it makes me, that he is very clearly into her and the whole ""i love you"" thing. she has some extracurriculars, so i won't hear from her until around 4:45. thanks everyone, so much. i'll let you all know what went down.

edit two: nothing yet from her, but i'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, because her phone battery is straight booty. if i don't hear from her this evening, assume all has gone wrong.

edit three: so, being 17, i have a momma to talk to. so, that's exactly what i did. i went driving with her, i've got to get those permit hours in somehow, and she and i both agreed to just let it ride for a day, see what she does, don't pressure her. however, come monday, i will confront the guy who is the troublemaker. obviously, i won't fight him, but he needs to explain himself and his actions. thank you all for the continual support, i love you all.

edit four: alright guys, here's the stunning conclusion to this saga. he called me, and apologized. he didn't know it was an issue, because apparently flirting with someone in a relationship isn't an obvious problem. he said ""it may have been bad"", but it most certainly was, he didn't get away with that. the girl is feeling much better now, so all things considered, we have come out of this stronger than we were going into it. thank you all, even the ""you're 17 shut up fag"" comments. i love you all unconditionally. night y'all.",8
"neighbor tresspassed on my property and posted online my custom carved wood in my yard as free for taking. it was taken by someone mistakenly thinking it was hers to give away. how can i proceed legall?. long story short, i live in ny. my bfs hobby is to take re-claimed wood custom cut it and make table tops or shelves out of them, selling some tables for $400 or more. i had 3 of these 7ft long oak wood sitting on the side of my house for a month, out to dry in the sun, on planks. those pieces can be sold for $1,200 or more when finished. this lady that lives in the area assumed they were for the trash and publicized the wood online as ""next to a dumpster and going to a landfill"" (my recycling bin was next to this wood, on the back end of my house.) i came home to my wood missing and i found her post online, giving it away for free with my exact home address for all to see. someone unknowingly thinking it was hers to give away snagged them. i contacted the guy, and got it back. i then wrote her a message showing her a screenshot of the ny state government property lines website of my properties boarder which she clearly crossed over to take the photo of the wood on my property. i told her to never do that again and mind her own business. her response was ""i am quite too busy to read all this, either way it was a mistake. good luck out there in this shitty world, it sure is a bear."" after that passive aggressive bullshit i went to the police. i filed for tresspassing. the cop said i could get her for possible larceny. idk how that wouldnwork if she didnt take it herself. i'm just wondering... how far can i push this? i am now completely uncomfortable with doing future projects in my own yard and the entire town i live in now knows my exact address attached to my name because of this lady. the cops said they would go to her home and ask her side of the story... i have pictures of her post, pictures of my property line and screenshots of many people i didnt know very well, asking me if her post was in fact the wood on my property that i had posted on my own fb that i was in search for, linking my exact name to that exact address. i work as a bartender in town, where i have many strange men i dont want knowing where i live. she posted it to my towns facebook page. maybe if she was more kind i would have let bygons be bygons but now, i'm thinking ""the world sure can be a bear""",2
"by not going to the hospital when i knew something was wrong with me. as usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. i'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident i was 29 years old. first, a little back story...

sunday, april 2, 2017 started like any other sunday for me. i woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. i drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. i drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. i was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

as i watched the video i felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. having never had a migraine before, i assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. the pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though i was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. they finished the oil and as they did, i texted my girlfriend to let her know that i had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

i got back to her house, popped a couple ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. i woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.

i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. my girlfriend tried her best to convince me that i needed to go to the er but i told her i just needed more rest and would be fine. she reluctantly let me try to rest as much as i could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. the only relief i could find was taking pain killers, which i'm not a big fan of, and napping.

i woke up tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" against my protest, she dragged me to the er...and saved my life.

i went in to the er and told them my symptoms, also telling them that i have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. they sent me to do a ct scan of my head, without the contrast because i wouldn't let them tap an iv on my arm. the ct scan was performed and i was brought back to the room to await the results. as i sat there i caught the dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""it was at this point i knew....something was fucked up!"" (dave chappelle voice)

the dr. came flying into the room and said, ""hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. i need to tap an iv on you right now, do another ct scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to stanford asap!""

my life stopped. ""a stroke? i'm 29? how could i have had a stroke?"" i couldn't comprehend what was happening but i looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. i got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (side note: i live in california but grew up in new jersey which is where all my family still resides) i quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. i asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

what happened next is a whirlwind. they tapped an iv, did a ct scan then i was transported by ambulance to stanford icu. i was greeted by the entire neurology department, both residents and students alike. the first woman i met said she, ""couldn't believe i was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" she told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

as i laid in icu they tapped an a-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more iv's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. they had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and i wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. they were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

my parents flew in from jersey by the next day and i was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (wednesday). if you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. i've had 3. they lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are not asleep. they then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. let me repeat, you are awake for this!

the first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. the blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. i was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and i was allowed to leave the hospital by friday morning. i used up all my fmla leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

but wait...there's more!!!

6 weeks later i had to go back to stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. this time they found the culprit. i had what is known as an arterioveneous fistula burst inside my brain. it's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. to my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which i did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke i went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. i was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the best neurosurgeons in the world. a 3rd angiogram was performed while i was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

i awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain i have ever been in. while i was asleep, two more iv's had been put into my arm, an a-line had been put in my wrist again, and i had a c-line, which is an iv in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. the fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. the next day after the surgery i realized that i had double vision so bad that i couldn't see with both my eyes open. it was either one or the other. i had to patch my eye until i could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. my surgery was on a wednesday and by friday i was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

fast forward, to october 2, 2017.

my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. around 11:30 am i took my lunch and finished reading my book i had been reading. at 12:30 pm i returned to work and about 10 minutes later i decided i had to use the bathroom. i left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. i started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. i think i tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in april) for help but i don't remember because i blacked out. next thing i remember was a foreman standing over me asking if i was alright and all i could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

i was delirious, i had smashed my face on the concrete when i fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. my supervisor took me to the er where they did ct scans, blood work, ekg and chest x-rays. my white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

i did a follow up with my pcp (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to stanford neurology to talk with them. and so i have...and this is where i am today...

i was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. the issue, as i've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. due to the amount of time i allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.

what this means for me now is i'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. thank god the company i work for is so large that they can move me to another position where i won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment i feel. working construction has been my all time favorite. i'm a blue collar guy and i get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. i've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. my days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is done. it sucks. i'm not happy about it, but i don't let it change my outlook on life.

i refuse to give up on life. i can get through anything and i will get through this. i'm out of work until january 8, 2018 at which point i will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as i did before.

i tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. please, i'm begging you! if you ever feel like something is wrong with you...do not hesitate! go to the hospital! don't be like me, mr. toughguy, thinking you can get through it. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. may god bless your life and your health

(tldr: had a stroke at age 29, almost died, had brain surgery, recovered, went back to work only to have a seizure my first day back caused by the stroke and am still awaiting return to work)

"daughter's friend (f18) is making me (m45) uncomfortable. i have known this girl for years. she always was a sweet girl and one of the things i always liked about her and my daughter was that they were never the type to be 14 going on 40. her family life is stable as far as i know and up until around 6 months ago she treated me like an adult - that is, a vaguely human shaped object that dispensed lifts and shit music.

&#x200b;

but around the time of my wife leaving my daughter and i, she and my daughter started making jokes between each other about getting me a new girlfriend. when i'd overhear, i'd ignore it and the two of them would go all red and embarrassed.

&#x200b;

then it seems to have escalated to her getting uncomfortably flirty with me. i acted dumb initially, but had to actually say something to her about it, because it was getting way too... frank? it stopped for a while, but after turning 18, she started up again and just made fun of me when i try to tell her to stop.

&#x200b;

so, to avoid anything else, i cut myself out of giving rides if she was in the party or being anywhere where she might be. but the past two weekends, she has called me in the middle of the night drunk as hell saying that she is going to walk home if i don't pick her up. so i pick her up, she gets really handsy to the point where i was having trouble driving, and every time i stop, she tries to put my hands on her.

&#x200b;

the first time i got her home, she got herself under control, and while her mother raised an eyebrow, she mostly believed my denials of getting her into this state. the second time, she didn't and it was bad. i was telling the truth, and even i thought i was a sleaze. i told her mother that i was indeed stupid for not calling her instead and should the girl try anything like that again, i'll call her instead of going anywhere.

&#x200b;

i really don't know what is going on here. i am a balding, overweight middle-aged man who feels like i am the butt of a joke somewhere having this 18-year-old acting so obsessively over me. i have spoken to my daughter about it who initially thought it was funny, but after a conversation with her friend is now kinda worried as well.

&#x200b;

i am sure that something else is going to happen, and i just need some advice on getting her to realize she should be with boys her own age.

&#x200b;

**\*\*edit: for the silly dickheads saying the equivalent of ""fuck her, hurr""\*\***

i have known this girl for 10 years. she was less than three feet tall when i first met her. she has come to sleepovers, birthday parties and family holidays. she has reached an arbitrary age that has confused her and is still learning the power of her femininity. she is acting in a way that could be dangerous around the wrong person.

i want her to find true happiness in her life and i want her and my daughter to stay friends so they can lean on each other during the difficulties of adulthood. the last thing i want is to mess up a young woman's mind and emotions for the sake of an orgasm. i am fairly sure it would mess me up as well.

**so for fucks sake, lay off the porn and have some god-damned sense.**

&#x200b;

**2nd edit: a few questions answered**

1. my relationship with my wife broke down because she was ashamed of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and refused to treat it. she became dangerous to live with and was arrested after a violent incident. she blamed me for her arrest and moved away. there has been no contact from her since she left. i have no ill-will towards her, but at the same time want nothing to do with her anymore.
2. my friend's daughter lives with her mother and sister. she has very little contact with her father. for example, he did not show up for her graduation or her prom but did send a card for her birthday. the mother is an immigrant from greece and can be very dramatic over things that aren't a big thing here.
3. i gave her a ride because i have fostered an environment of safety over discipline with my daughter and her friends/boyfriends. when i was that age, i did not call my parents when i was high or drunk because the discipline was often worse than whatever danger i was in. i am known in her friends circle as someone safe to call when they need to get home without giving any grief. my daughter's friend is not the only one i have given rides to.
4. my daughter initially thought it was funny and that her friend was just messing with me. when she spoke to her, my daughter didn't tell me much but agreed that i have to stay away from her.
5. it really breaks my heart to go no-contact with her as she is the oldest and closest friend of my daughter. but at this stage i have to.
6. i don't really drink anymore and on the rare occasions i do, i am usually camping with the dog at least half a day's hike away from the car, so would never drive drunk.

"if alcohol was invented today it would be prohibited. imagine if alcohol wasn't with us in culture and society since ages, and the drug was invented today.

alcohol causes more deaths and injuries than all other drugs together, combined. the ""accidents"" on the roads due to alcohol worldwide, the number of domestic violence cases, fights in bars and on the street in places where you can go out. 

suicides, shortening of life span for those who use it, liver problems, brain problems, problem problems

"my 26f girlfriend 24f thinks she's an instagram influencer and it's driving me crazy!. when i met my girlfriend 3 years ago, i knew very quickly she was addicted to instagram. she was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

this didn't really bother me at first - i actually found it kind of hot? mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - i felt, i guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then i think).

other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. every day is punctuated by ""insta time"" where i'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for instagram content... it's ridiculous. we've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, i'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. i'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

it was routine stuff, i asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

so the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. she desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. she's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but i didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for ig, she was actually trying to make money from it. i know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. before you say it - yes, i'm probably going to break up with her. but the thing is, she's got a really good heart and i genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). is there anything i can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform.",8

"can marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least?. they're over-saturating the market to the extent that they're really going to go the way of the western at some point. talk about franchise fatigue. yeah, *marvel isn't immune*. they're going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

and, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren't honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest marvel releases. 

from a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren't good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. the stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

they're almost identical to the transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

no, i'm not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up rt with fresh scores for every marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it ""4 stars"" or ""fresh"" because ""it's fun, i guess"" or ""it'll work for the audience it's meant for"". these films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it's in the zeitgeist to. 

of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, marvel is the one that earned that success the least. it just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them ""new"" and ""creative"" because they change up the setting a bit. no. no, i'm sorry, that's not the picture of creative dexterity. they're safe, bland, blow em up action films.",6

"update my ex girlfriend committed suicide.. i am a firefighter and had to find her body. its been a bit over 6 months since i posted that story and i want to give you a quick update on my life. im on mobile so i apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 tl;dr my ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. she was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. i am a firefighter in nj, but go to school in nh. i received the call and conducted research to find her. i drove back down to help with the search. we found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. i was in a dark place for a while after that. i drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. for a good amount of time i distanced myself from any girl who i met.

the funeral wasnt long after and jim didnt even show up. im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


i didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. it felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. the depression i felt was destructive.

my chief reached out to me not long after because i never told him how i knew her. he asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. i was in nh so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

i lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. i had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

after 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. i met this really nice girl named sarah. we talked  and even hooked up a couple times. after a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. i told her i couldnt. i told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. she took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. i felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. i didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

fast forward another month my friend kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. i accepted and thats when i met kristen. kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. we ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. i opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. she completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

she convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. so i made an appointment and went. the therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. i joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

i did my first story and kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. it was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. i continued doing these events and kristen went to every single one. 

after 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. she understood. weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

every time im in nj i go to lydias house and support her mom. on christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews.

"by going to my parents house, and now i need to bleach my eyes.. literally happened ten minutes ago, the fallout has yet to happen.


bit of a backstory, i (26m) live about 45 minutes from my parents house, and my eldest sister (30f) lives across the street from me but works close to my rents.


my parents, and my youngest sister (15f) are out of town on vacation. now, i generally go to my parents house to work on my truck (my dad has spent a lot of money on his truck, and thus has a well stocked garage. plus i live in an apartment complex and don't have a garage).


so i'm going over there to do a few things, put some braided stainless brake lines on, and do an oil change.


this is where it happens. now, my parents have two dogs. and i was trying to sneak into the house and being as quiet as possible, as i knew my eldest sister was house sitting and i didn't want them to lose their shit.


this is where the fuckup happens.


it works. i'm quiet. i sneak into the house, and silently close the door. i heard some strange noises coming from the living room, so i go, thinking the dogs were playing.


it was not the dogs playing.


it was, in fact, my eldest sister and her boyfriend. on the couch.

with her sitting on his lap facing away from him, towards me with her eyes closed.


i have now seen my sisters birthday suit being penetrated by her boyfriend.


i also now know what my sisters face looks like in this process.

an example of what i'm talking about here is that i used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  at first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  the answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether i do it or not. now i don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

i also noticed that i was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. people would come but nobody ever really made a point to say  that they appreciated i was doing it. i stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. now i only do it if i feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.

these are all things *i* would appreciate if someone did *for me* but that doesn't mean everyone else feels the same way.",9

"ex girlfriend says she will never stop suing. my boyfriend left his ex-girlfriend almost 2 years ago. they were together for about 5 years with no children together.  they had just purchased a home together in the u.s. and have been going to court for a year and a half over it.  he paid for almost everything,  so the court  said they must sell the house and awarded him a much higher percentage of the proceeds. she appealed on the grounds that the judge was unfair to her as a single mother (she had a 24 year old son)  and although we are still waiting to hear back,  it sounds like the court will probably stand by their original decision.  all this really did was prolong this ordeal. 
she emailed my boyfriend a few days ago and basically told him that because she can't keep the  house, she is going to sue him for multiple reasons after they finish this round. although i don't think she will win anything, we really can't afford to keep paying a lawyer to represent him for another year or two.  he has already paid over 20k and we just can't do this much longer.   
my question is,  can she just sue him over and over? how do we handle this? his lawyer honestly has not been overly helpful.

"when i was hired i was given a key and told if i lose it i owe $15,000. i lost it. do i have to pay up?. i am located in michigan.  

okay so when i was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) i was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  i was told that if i ever lost said key i would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

i have lost this key.  (it was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. i was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

so now my boss and my boss' boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the ""money i owe.""   i have received letters from their official letterhead and i am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. and they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

i have no intention of paying the fine.

the catch is that i was told this was the consequence verbally when i was handed the key.  my supervisor told me ""you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we'll worry about that later.""   i replied with ""to be clear, i will not be paying that if i haven't signed yet.  do you want to keep possession of the key until then?""  my supervisor laughed as though i was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn't forget to have me sign, he promised.

well he never brought it up again and i of course did not either.  

my question is.  can i be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of ""verbal contract?"" at this point i have not reminded them that i never signed.  i have simply ignored them.  but i worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and i'm not sure how to proceed.  i will be visiting my lawyer monday.  so hopefully more answers then. 

$15,000 is about 1/3 of my yearly salary. i can not afford this ""charge.""

"for purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?. this issue is honestly making me frustrated. almost everyone is saying i am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and i genuinely don't know if what i did was correct or not. i just feel so lost. please, please do help.

i am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when i was 13. i have 2 really deep,long facial scars. i have been bullied really bad because of it. i am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. people make fun of other people by saying things like ""why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" i am honestly used to it. those people didn't matter to me anyway.

but there is this girl i had known since middle school. let's call her back i guess? sorry, i honestly don't know how this works. i had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. i thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. my family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. i can play a guitar so i made this whole song for her. i went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. this was the first time i felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and i felt that regardless of what i do, she shall see me for who i am and at least accept me as a friend.

i was over the moon when she ended up accepting. we went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. she was really sweet to me. the next week or so was honestly heaven. people started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, i honestly cried everyday because i felt so fortunate to get so much love.
it all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on instagram and followed beck, sent screenshots to me. i honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

she had posts saying 'fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his valentine's"", 'making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of march, and then distance themselves from me. she apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.and thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since i was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

i was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. my blood was boiling. i researched about this award, found a facebook page about it online.i went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

she is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. i am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly i have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


edit: i am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. each comment means the world to me. i am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. no one besides my family has said these things to me. i know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. from the bottom of my heart,thank you.

edit 2: honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. i promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. thank you for the gold.thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. i honestly have gone through as many as i can and i just feel really fortunate and grateful.

i sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

edit 3: i am sorry for boring you with all these edits. i geniunely can't thank you guys enough. i showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. i am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

but, i have been noticing a worrying number of dms saying me i could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

i am not this kind of person and i hope nobody is. i have my own integrity. it's not right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. a couple of other dms sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. it's honestly horrifying. i am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. i just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

i thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. a lot of women are amazing. my mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and i am sure many women out there are amazing.  please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. because i am not going to do that, ever. please don't say all women are manipulative etc.

"if i back out of being maid of honor at my best friends wedding next weekend? best man is my ex fiance who cheated on me and i can't be around him let alone walk arm in arm with him.. jump into the worst week of my life. i was with my ex fiance for 6 years. loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for august. refused a job offer so could move with him for his next air force assignment. monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) i text back she must have wrong number. she says she doesn't. in a moment of brains i pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. i'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. 

i confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. i consider it for half a second and say no. cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of std tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who i loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. 

and on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll ""make it up to me."" 

i've never hated a human being as much as i hate him. i can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. i understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because i'm upset. so i just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. 

woukd i be the asshole if i back out of the wedding?

edit 2: ok guys i don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or nta and said i should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. i'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from ""panama"" where she said ""remember, you liked tounging my asshole?"" so when i get sad i have an instant reminder of who he really is. and then when it's all over i'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. if i can update a week from now i will. i still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.


edit 3 (that wont be seen): guys i've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3am last  monday (or tuesday, or whatever). i have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. that just isn't the case, at all. i love her as much as i love any person on the planet and she has my back. but this wedding is now a week away. it's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fiance not to come. everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. my ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. he's as close with the groom as i am with her. if they make big changes now then the day becomes about what he did, not about the wedding. it's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like i said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. if i bring that up then this whole week becomes about that. my best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. they didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. my friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fiance to walk in with other people or even separately, but i'm not going to do that. first of all because i think it will look weird. and secondly i foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him one last time--forever and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come august but he fucked it up.",3

"my38m wife 24f of 3 years, took my daughter14f to visit her parents in russia. wife doesn't want to come back. like above. sorry for ranting and any grammar errors i've been sitting in an airport for over almost 9 hours and making a lot of calls and had a bit to drink. also this is a throwaway so i don't completely dox myself. 

my wife went to visit her parents who live in a small suburb outside of st. petersburg, russia. 

my wife herself was born there, and came to the us when she was around 18 years old - when we first met. (this is not a mail order bride scenario or anything of the sort). i was finishing my up my post-grad, she was starting her undergrad - one thing lead to another and here we are. 

as she was a student when we first met, she did not anticipate meeting me and us getting so deeply involved - so she never planned on staying in the us. it just kind of happened that way. (she entered on a f1 visa then a k1 visa now she has a green card). 

understandably, she misses her family a lot, though for the most part we've been extremely happy together, minus the standard few squabbles here and there. 

3 years ago we had two wedding ceremonies, one in the us with my family and one in russia with her family and a mix of my immediate family. 

until last week she hadn't seen her family since the wedding due to her finishing up school and helping out my daughter, as i have custody. 

as school wrapped up for her, and as a graduation gift, we decided it'd be a good idea for her to go visit her family for a week. she wanted to bring my daughter with her - i initially was opposed to this - but i caved and let her bring her(my daughter wanted to go) 

through her trip she hasn't been too much in contact with me aside the occasional message on whatsapp and photos etc. which is understandable - she's on vacation and i don't expect constant alerts, but i would have liked a little more of an update. my daughter has been texting me almost daily and showing me photos as well. 

yesterday morning i had texted my wife that i'd be there to pick them at the airport at the time she had told me the flight arrived. she read the message but never answered. i told my daughter the same and she never responded. i assumed they were just busy and left it at that. 

i had a hellish day at work so i went right to bed so i could be up early to go get them. 
i wake up today stupidly without checking my app and go to the airport, the arrival time comes and i look at my phone to message them. i see about 60 messages from my daughter panicking starting nearly 15 hours ago saying that she missed her flight and doesn't know how to get home. confused as shit - she tells me my wife basically told her how to get home and then dropped her off at the airport. 

 panicked i reach out to her and blow up her whatsapp. she finally answers and sends a long 3 paragraph essay on how she has missed her family so much she doesn't want to leave them and she wants to stay longer. 

pissed off that she waited to tell me this, she left my daughter alone at an airport in another country, that i took off work to come today to get her, and how this is so last minute - i go off on her through text. she tells me off and stops answering me. 

i reach out to her mom through whatsapp (who doesn't speak english at all) and using google translate ascertain that she wants to stay for another month for her brothers birthday party. her mom said she didn't know this was going on and went to the airport to go help my daughter get back safely. 

panicked i go to reach out the us consulate in saint petersburg only to find online it was shut down in march and the nearest is in moscow. i reach out to the moscow one and luckily get almost an immediate response and they were a huge help in getting my daughter on her correct flights. even having someone meet her on the connecting airport to help her to the right terminal safely. 

my wife still hasn't answered me since our blow out. and her mom said she hasn't seen or heard from her since this morning.

what the hell am i supposed to even do with this? the lack of responsibility and carelessness she showed is astronomical to me.",8

"i19m recently found out that my older sister34f is actually my biological mother.. throwaway account because i don't want this linked to my main account.

&#x200b;

my older sister(let's call her rose) and i have a great relationship since i was a baby. we were raised with an amazing adoptive family and she has always taken care of me.

i grew up in a very warm and loving environment but from what i was told i was lucky.

i was told the story of how me and my sister had two drug addict parents who never took care of us. they never bothered feeding us and used to left us at a junky friends house for days to go out partying. when my mom was pregnant with me she smoked and got drunk(luckily i turned out pretty fine) pretty often and when i was born my sister was the only one who took care of me. when i was 2 months old they left us both in a mall and left. we got help from an old couple(who also turned into our adoptive family) and we contacted the police but my parents weren't at the house, which looked like a homeless cave. we never saw them again and after several months in foster care the couple that helped us(throughout the whole way btw) agreed to adopt us. today i'm 19 and rose is 34, i still live with my adoptive family and she lives about 20 minutes away so i come and visit her at least 3-4 times a week.

&#x200b;

so a couple of months ago my friend offered me to take a dna test to find some information about my heritage, since my sister wouldn't speak of them much. after the results came in i found out some pretty interesting things(like being 50% ashkenazi jew) i found out later that i had an aunt\33f\ in the system. i immediately reached out to her(let's call her jennet) and we agreed to meet in person. all that without telling rose a thing.

when we met up i could see we have some similar characteristics like same hair color and same eyes. we tried to figure things out so i asked her if she has a brother or sister and she told me that when she was 13 her 14 year old sister got pregnant while being drunk with her junky boyfriend and a month after giving birth she ran away with the baby after some pretty intensive fights with their parents. they never found her and stopped looking after 1.5 years.

i connected the dots, asked to see a picture of her, so we went to her parents house. mom wasn't home and father died 3 years ago. when i saw the picture, i knew. this was rose, 100%.

rose is my mom, we were never abandoned, we didn't have junky parents and she fabricated the entire thing to me and our adoptive family.

i immediately gave jennet a hug and told her that it's too much for me right now and asked her to keep it a secret for now.

i went to my best friends house, told him everything and for a week now i'm sleeping over at his place. i told my parents and my sister im at his house because he bought a new game that we both wanted for long and avoided talking to rose much.

i can't look her in the eyes right now, let alone tell her i know the truth.

what the hell am i supposed to do? how should i handle this? should i tell her i know?

&#x200b;

edit: my best friend just took me out for a movie and a drink(im not that drunk right now though). i thank you all so much for your warm replies, made me look at the situation a bit clearer. i have decided to break it to rose this week but i need some time to think about how to tell her i know.i don't know if i should try getting there slowly or just break the news to her somehow. i even considered bringing her sister with me but i genuinely think she will be pissed. i'll keep updating as soon as i'll decide how to tell her. right now going to bed to sleep it over.

&#x200b;

edit 2: after seeing some comments asking how the adoption process went, i decided i need to explain some things. first of all it's worth mentioning that the adoption process wasn't immediate and it took about a  year between the time that happy couple found us outside the mall and the time they adopted us. we were in foster care that time and rose use to keep touch with them and they would come visit us once or twice a week(or so im told, i don't know what to believe now)/ eventually rose broke down in tears for them and told them she hates foster care and that her little brother(me) would grow up here and she couldn't bare that thought. at that time they decided to try and adopt her and hired lawyers and stuff and after a few months it was legal and done. at least that what i was told. i don't think my adoptive parents knew but if they did then that story is probably a lie too.

i swore my court date was on the 8th. i put it in my calendars. i took time from work. nope. it was the 6th. but i searched this sub, found out i needed to call. so i called first thing in the am. they told me to come on friday (today) and i could pay or i could reschedule my court date. i said i wanted to just pay and they told me my ticket would be $95. i asked if i had a warrant out because i missed, and they told me i wouldn't as long as i came and took care of it by 4:30 on friday. 

i went in, had to wait about 20 minutes while they got all the people ready to go into traffic court. then they helped me. i paid $95 and was only 10 minutes late for work.

"for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out.. throwaway as my dad uses reddit. 

so i'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. 

my parents decided to give me a gift for when i graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. i remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. 

that was untill i found out the terms and conditions, i can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses i can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. 

so i told my parents that i cant accept the gift as i dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,i also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. 
i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where i was called ungrateful and that i'm not a nice daughter. so i walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off.

"i think my 3 year old is being sexually abused at daycare x-post from /r/parenting. originally posted in /r/parenting, but it was suggested i post here... edit per bot request: we are in california.

my son has been in the same church run daycare/preschool for about a year. at the time, we didn't love the place, but we were desperate because i needed to go back to work and it was the only place that would work with my part time schedule. (we didn't love it because it didn't seem as academic as others, but he was only two so we let it go).

he seems to really like it there. most days he doesn't even say goodbye to me, he just runs into which ever room they have setup and starts playing. he seems to like some kids and teachers more than others, but that seems normal enough. he occasionally has rough/clingy mornings, but they are pretty rare and seem to correlate with story time on fridays, but not every friday.

i'm not sure if some of his new behaviors are unusual or just par for the course for a toddler/threenager. he never used to mind diaper changes, but started kicking and screaming during them sometimes after he started at the daycare. he's always been a strong willed kid, but screaming ""i don't want to"" and ""put me down"" are things he picked up at daycare for whatever reason. i thought it was odd that the church pastor would be reading to the kids sometimes when i dropped my kid off on fridays, and even weirder that he sometimes had kids in his lap, but the teachers were always there and it was always a group activity.

we had some concerns, but nothing concrete and more that he was learning to hit/push than anything worse. until today. we finish up dinner and i get the bath ready for our 1 year old, leaving the 3 year old at the dinner table with my husband. i'm minding my business, bathing the baby when my husband comes into the bathroom to relay something the 3 year old just did and said. it should be noted that our toddler doesn't yet speak in complete sentences or fully respond when   asked questions (ex ""what did you do at school today?"" gets no answer while ""did you paint at school today?"" garners an appropriate ""yep!"" or ""nope!""). our toddler had finished his dinner and, after we had cleaned up his plate, he asked for peanut butter pretzels, one of his favorite snacks. normally, we'd say no, but he'd been a good kid all day so my husband said ""sure! but cheek kiss first"" and leaned into our normally very affectionate kiddo. our son slapped my husband across the face and said ""no! pretzels now!"". not great, but not out of the ordinary for him after a long day (we don't hit our kids, but he definitely struggles with hitting when he's frustrated). he did/said this twice and then said ""get candy!"". my husband said ""no candy right now"" and then asked ""do you get candy at school?"" our son then grabbed two of my husband's fingers, rubbed the tips with his fingers several times, said ""it's round, it's round"" and then licked them repeatedly. he did this several times. (just typing this is making me nauseous again). my husband asked if that's how he got candy and our son repeated the behavior/motion and then put his finger to his lips and said ""shhhh!"", then put his other pointer finger to my husband's lips and said ""shhhh!"" (we only ever use ""shhh"" to comfort them when crying and have never put our fingers to his or our lips). my husband tried to gently ask more questions, but our son just mumbled nonsense and then asked to get out of his highchair.

my husband came and told me immediately and we got the baby out of the tub, and tried to talk to the toddler again, but he'd moved on and just wanted to go sit on the couch. we didn't know what to do (this was around 730pm), so we called local pd dispatch and they sent over an officer who just told us to speak to the director of the school.

i've tried searching this sub and others and have come across a few sort of related posts, but i have no idea what to do. local resources open in the morning, and we have already told our workplaces that we won't be in tomorrow due to a family emergency, but we don't know where to start. i can't in good conscience send him back there again.

are we overreacting? do we just confront the director? how do we handle this? i obviously don't know what or who exactly, but this definitely seems off. any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.


edit:

first, thanks to everyone for their supportive messages and comments and for taking the time to reply. we are truly blown away by your kindness and thoughtful words. we are also very grateful for all of the advice.

second, an update. our son didn't go to the school today and will not return in the future. we didn't contact the school and we don't plan to at all. we'll be out our deposit, but it's worth it at this point. i have another center that we will be touring next week, but we are also prepared for me to stay home with the kiddos for awhile.

this morning my husband called cps and they said they only handle situations where the abuser is in the home. next, he called the state licensing board and filed a complaint. the school has an otherwise squeaky clean record, but we were assured they would be opening up an investigation and interviewing every employee at the school. finally, we called and then visited the local family advocacy center (basically relevant charities, social workers, law enforcement, etc under one roof). we met with a social worker and recounted the same points as above. when she was done taking notes, she called one of the onsite detectives who confirmed that without actual evidence (ie a verbal description of something from our son or physical evidence), there was nothing he could do. without the cops getting involved, we will not be referred to a forensic psychologist or have the situation otherwise escalated.  as frustrating as that is, we are almost fortunate in a way that that type of evidence doesn't seem to exist (or that we stepped in before it did). as many of you said, both the detective and the social worker agreed that the cop that came by yesterday handled it very poorly, but that there was nothing they could do about that either. the social worker mentioned that our son seemed to be a happy kid, not the withdrawn or angry type she's seen in more serious situations. we were referred to a center that specializes in play based therapy that we will be following up with as well. if anything comes out during those sessions, the situation will be handed over to the authorities at that time. 

i think that covers everything that happened today. my husband had to go back to work so i've been at home on the couch cuddling my kiddos. if there are any developments, i'll update again, but that is it for now.

thank you again for everything, reddit. you truly came through in our time of need ❤️

"thinking about abandoning pregnant gf.... my gf is pregnant and i was really excited to be a dad when i first got the news. problem is we went to prenatal screening and found out there is a high risk of down syndrome. a follow up diagnostic test confirmed the baby has down syndrome.

i want an abortion because i am not prepared to raise a child with down syndrome. this is not me bashing down syndrome people by the way, it's just not something i'm prepared to do. my gf doesn't want an abortion though so there's nothing i can do about that.

at this point i'm considering just ending the relationship. i'd pay whatever i'm required to by law, but otherwise move on with my life. my gf obviously decides whether to take the pregnancy to term, but i feel like i have a right to leave given how immensely different a child with down syndrome is as far as responsibilities and future grand children.

anyway, i'm asking for advice about how to break the news to my gf. i obviously have to tell her asap so that she can make an informed decision.  but i don't want to come across as manipulative.

i realise i'm coming across like a heartless prick here, but i genuinely care about my gf and want to do this in the best way possible for her emotionally",8
"woman threatens to sue me because i posted her on reddit. summary:

a few hours ago a woman contacted me asking if i was able to design a logo for her and her perfume brand.
the conversation was polite until she said she was unable to pay me and might was able to pay me in a different way (which i think nudes and  i am under age).
she told me she would fuck me up and i didn't take it serious,  just had a good laugh out of it and posted it on reddit (post(https://www.reddit.com/r/choosingbeggars/comments/au7ygj/sure_ill_make_a_logo_that_i_have_to_work_3_hour/?st=jsjae8gg&sh=35d7b55d)

"if your dog has cancer and you opt for chemo, you're a bad person.. an old dog lives to be 15. they are also the most loyal and perfect friend could ever possibly hope for. we truly are not good enough for dogs. on the grand scale of intelligence in this world, they are also complete and total idiots. they don't understand medicine. they don't understand that you are trying to extend their life. 

all they know is that on a regular basis the most important person in their life, their owner, is taking them to a strange, smelly, terrifying torture arena. they are stabbed, poked, prodded and their veins are filled with poison. the next thing they know they have gone from terrified to nauseated, fatigued and just feeling like absolute shit. and you, their human, are doing it for what? to squeeze out a tortured 1 - 5 more years?

they don't understand and they can't consent. let your beautiful friend enjoy the last few months in peace and then send them off surrounded by their family. you're not trying to save your dog, you're being cruel because you don't want to let go.

edit time!! everything above this is the same as when i originally posted it. below is my addendum. 

so, it has come to my attention that i was pretty misinformed on how pets react to chemo and the purpose of it. thanks to those of you who were willing to explain without your pitchfork and torch at the ready. for more information on pets and chemo i went to this site, seems reliable(https://wvrc.com/veterinary-specialties/veterinary-oncology-wi/chemotherapy-general-information/). 

in keeping with the spirit of this sub i'd be willing to alter my unpopular opinion to instead state, ""if your dog has ~~cancer and you opt for chemo~~ *a serious health condition and you opt for expensive treatment*, you're a bad person.""

i know how hard it is so say goodbye to your pet. the reason i think you're a bad person is because you're willing to pay exorbitant medical expenses to extend an animal's life because you don't want to say goodbye, especially in instances when the animal is suffering.

in closing, i get it. putting your pet down is a very personal decision, but i still get to think you're a bad person if i think your reasons are shitty.",6

"almost eating my cousin out in her office. (update at bottom!)

this happened yesterday. i can't wait until it's much further away than that.

so this is a throwaway, i have \*(had) another account where i like to post nudes of myself. that can be your judgement, and why i do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but i do. as a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies i get are from guys. but occasionally i get replies from girls who frequent these subs. my face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. just my... ya know, body.

so i had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. she said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. a lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

she is from a large city on the other side of the country as i am, but conveniently i was traveling there next week (this week). we started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. she worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. this idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. we decided i would carry an envelope and say its for office ""xxx,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. no names needed.

most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared waaay too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. we literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. and lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

so along comes yesterday, the big day. i'm so worked up. she's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. shows me that she is already masturbating. etc. oh lord, etc. i text her and tell her i'm in the building. i get to her office, my heart is racing but i'm beyond excited. i see the receptionist, tell her i need a signature from office ""xxx"" and she points me in the right direction. as i walk up, i see the name on the door. my cousins name. my first cousin, who i have known my whole entire life. my cousin, who i spend every holiday with and am very close with. it can't be, i think.

so i knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. and she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. i just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""heyyyy cousin, i was in town and thought i'd stop by!"" she is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""omg cousin!"" and gets up to hug me. i literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. she tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

i race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. she surely thinks this guy ghosted her, i really don't think she thought it was me. maybe i read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. i'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. i don't know really though. i texted her later and told her i was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. we're supposed to get a drink tonight. i'm petrified and don't know how in god's name i will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  it's hard to reply to all of the comments, so i'll say some stuff here.  she works for a very large company in a very large city.  she told me what floor to go, i honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    i do know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if i wanted.  like i said, it's a big company, and not a shock that i could pop in.

yes she is on reddit but i highly doubt she will see this post.  she told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  headed out for drinks now.  wish me luck guys.  i think i'm going to be honest.  i don't know.

edit 3:  well, first of all, id like to address everyone calling bs on this.  it seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  i agree and would call bs reading this also.   i can't really defend it or prove it (or can i?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, i could give a shit!)

• she doesn't have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

• she lives in nyc, it's big.  the buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. it didn't occur to me, i guess i was worked up.

• i come here often, it's not that i didn't call her, but sometimes when i'm here she'll dm or comment on my insta story and say ""hey come by and visit next time""

• in our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  there was no door man or anyone else i needed to get past.  i don't know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.

• we didn't actually say ""hey cousin"" lol, i'm just censoring our names for the post.

• yes guys post nudes to reddit, i would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)

• i'm 35, she's 26.

• i deleted my account after freaking out, but i'm sure i'll post again and i'll let you know lol.



oooookay, so now onto drinks.

i decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn't fucking focus on anything else.  and as many of you guessed, she knew. she didn't buy the ""i just popped in"".  she figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that i knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  i assured her i didn't, it was really weird.  we slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  we complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  we talked about if we actually did anything, it's a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  and then we had another drink.  and then i licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  i stroked myself while i did it, and after i made her cum she helped me out.  we promised we would never do this again, but i think we'll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.

"by relaxing too much during a sensual massage. bit of back story. i started talking to a guy on reddit last week. we hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. we decided to meet for a date on friday. i have ibs and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. i was also very tired.

the fu: so i'm at this guy's house and i've made us a very nice mac n cheese. there was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. we're then snuggling on the sofa and i feel a big fart brewing. i'm hoping i can just absorb it back in to my body if i hold on to it long enough. 

we start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. i choose a 'relaxing' oil. i'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. he starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. i'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.

i then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart i have ever expelled. the fart i was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. it was hella loud and it was hella long. and it was right on his balls. it was so forceful, they vibrated.

his response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'at least you didn't shit yourself'.

tldr: farted on a first date's balls.

"my (20f) boyfriend (20m) invites my best friend (20f) out to games, just the two of them.. my boyfriend(lets call him j) and i have been together for a year and me and my best friend(lets call her g) have been friends since grade school. j and g are both varsity players and are addicted to watching sports. they would follow hockey, baseball, soccer, football, basketball, like almost any game they love. however, i'm not really a sports person but still i would make the effort to attend their games. i would also make an effort to learn and understand their games. j plays football and g plays soccer.

j was using my laptop and forgot to logout his facebook account. i know its wrong to snoop but i couldn't help it. some his teammates were messaging him and i clicked on the message icon and saw that he was messaging g. i got curious and scrolled through it and saw that he invited g out to multiple games, saying that he will buy 2 tickets for this game or that game. g would decline and tell him that he should invite me. j then said that i wouldn't understand and that i was not fun to be with in these kinds of things. g said that he is being unfair to me. j still sends multiple messages to g about wanting to talk and wanting to go out with her.

this has been going on for months. g has said nothing to me about this and the only thing that she did to kinda allude to the situation is to text me list of games that i should watch because those are j's favorite teams.

i kinda feel betrayed by both of them. although i feel more betrayed by j than g.

what should i do? how should i approach this?

**update**: thank you everyone for your advice. i approached g first and told her that i've seen the messages. she was relieved that i came to her and talked to her about it. she explained that she didn't know what to do because she didn't want to do anything that would destroy our friendship. she also assured me that next time she will tell me if anything shady like this happens again and that she will always have my back. we both apologized to each other and hugged it out.

i also have to admit that snooping through j's messages are wrong. the reason i did that because there are some rumours that he hits on other girls at away games and i was feeling insecure and worried about it. but it still does not justify the way i went about it.

as for j, we will meet up later tonight. i honestly think it is over between us. he also has a lot of guys friends to go with him to games and he also would never invite me. i would rather salvage my relationship with my friend, than continue my relationship with him and stay feeling insecure.

thank you people of reddit for the advice.

**update 2**: g told me that i should start by saying ""hey, g told me that you were inviting her out to games"" and i did exactly that. j became defensive and told me that he never invited her. i told him that i saw the messages and he asked if g showed me the messages. i told him the truth that i saw it through his fb and he was furious at me. he told me that i violated his privacy and i apologized for it. then he told me that he was asking out g because his friends felt that g was a lesbian. he was trying to get proof by asking her out and that her not reciprocating is proof that she is one. at this point i'm like ""whaaaaat?!"". he said that he was doing that to protect me and i'm like what?. he then left and told me that he needed space and that i should text him after i got my head cleared up. i texted him ""stay away from me and g"". that was honestly a wild ride.",8

"lpts: chrome extensions i wish i knew of back when i started college.. as i am about to enter my grad school i have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. as a result, i recently started exploring chrome extensions, and man i wish i had done this earlier. some will no longer be of use to me but i hope it can help others. 

**cite this for me: web citer**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)
this one hurts me a bit as my days with mla, apa, harvard, and chicago are coming to an end. the extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. from my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as easybib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.

**google dictionary**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)
if you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). it's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. i imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. 

**grammarly for chrome**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)
i often use bad grammar and i know it. this extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. it highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. 

**readability**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)
this extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. i would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article i'd give this a shot. 

**speakit!**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-us)

i know i can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. this app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. or i guess you could take notes as you listen too...

it works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand german-english accents over the default one). you can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. i could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but i would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. 

**block & focus**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)

type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. there are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. 

**molview**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)

i haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in o-chem or higher. it allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. i was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what i'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.

**bonus tips that i learned**


***make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. it will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. 

***use sleepyti.me(http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** it's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. i cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as i stayed up too late studying. 

***use rainymood(https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** i'm sure many of you know about it but i love this one.

i'm sure i have missed a lot of good extensions and tips. feel free to tell me any i should try out! 

**use f.lux(https://justgetflux.com/) to dim your pc screen to prevent eye strain and help you fall asleep** -credit to kreekybonez for that one!

good luck in your studies my friends!
_________________________________________________________________________
edit: cleaned up the post and added the links to the extensions. also added flu.x per kreekybonez as it is one i think people should be aware of. 
_________________________________________________________________________
edit: thanks for the love guys, this blew up way more than i expected! glad to help. wanted to mention a few things after reading through many of your comments.

i hope that most of you know to still be careful with your grammar and citations. it isn't really that different from the autocorrect for word and easy bib. **always double check your writing if it is an important paper, especially with citations**. but if you're like me you can use it for the basics and check over the formatting after the fact. just wanted to throw that out there as many redditors have been commenting on those two extensions. otherwise thanks for all the suggestions and upvotes of course!

recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we've hosted them in the past when they've visited. the first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. he drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. my wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. he told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

this weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. his mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn't pay attention to him as much as before. he got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. when my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. i stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. here's the part where i may be the asshole. i told my cousins i didn't feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and i know for sure she didn't, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. i told them i couldn't allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. i apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. they didn't say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

i guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that i should've been more understanding and that i was wrong to ask them to leave. 

am i the asshole?

edit for added info: 

thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. there's not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when i saw how many had reached out to me), but i wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. the first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. my dad is an only child so the cousin i refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad's first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). i'm not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). the reason i refer to him as my nephew is because he's the generation after mine in our family tree and it's less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. a lot of people have posted that it's not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, i don't care, and my family's never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. i apologize if it was misleading in my post. without being specific, in the western state i was born and grew up in, it's not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. i call him my nephew because my cousin and i were close and i still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though i don't know how after this situation). 

2. some have asked if i was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. the first time, i thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. remember, in my mind he's my nephew and i never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. regarding the situation that happened this weekend, i was only concerned for my wife and son's safety. i didn't know how he would react and followed my cousin's lead, but wasn't about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. i don't know what was said to my paternal grandmother but i don't want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we've both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",3

"for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner. ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. she would make noises in between conversations like ""bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. this is especially embarrassing when i am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


i have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. i have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


it was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. we went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""


seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. i rolled my eyes and told her:


""i am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. please excuse me.""

"by ejaculating in front of my girlfriend's mother. now this didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and i am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

so, a few weeks ago i was at my gf's house, usually the plan when i go is i sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch tv, play games and other stuff. everything was normal, i chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general tv.

this is where the fuck up happens.

after around an hour or so, me and my gf were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

i'm enjoying this more than i ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since i started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

she starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. literally within less than 30 seconds, i'm already ready to release my load, i try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but i just can't, it feels too good. 

right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst i'm there in my birthday suit. my girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock i release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

i sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. my girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then i hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

although me and my gf are still together, i haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

"by asking for vagina in a japanese convenience store. for context, i'm on a vacation to japan and has been staying at my friend's apartment for 3 days. to show a bit of gratitude, i wanted to cook for her so i decided to go for something simple like a chicken katsu.

i've already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. this is the moment i realized that i was out of breadcrumbs so i have to go to the convenience store to get some. i am somewhat decent in japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? no.

as i walked in the store, i couldn't find the breadcrumbs i was looking for so i decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:

me: ""sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?"" which literally translates to ""excuse me, where is da pussy?""

at this point i didn't realize that i mixed ""manko(pussy)"" and ""panko(breadcrumbs)"". the staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking i was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. i repeated the question 3 times, the staff's face switched from being confused to disgusted. after the change of the staff's expression, i realized that i fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. i then explained that i mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.

"for sleeping over at my gfs 4 nights a week making her roommate uncomfortable and causing her to flip out?. let me preface this by saying that i (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. i've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. this is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. i'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

now, i've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. her beds bigger for starters and i cant cook at home because it's always congested, so liv and i cook a meal twice a week at hers. she has a roommate who we'll call (bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. i've tried my best to get to know bianca but it's not reciprocated and i can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. she's never asked a question about what i do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

liv told me that bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. i hate being the cause of her discomfort. whenever i'm at livs house, i don't use the living room and go straight to livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). besides cooking with liv, i'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

here's where liv and i may have screwed up. we were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). all of a sudden bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
we both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

"update: for refusing to wear a wig to my friend's wedding?. the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c0xp8l/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_wig_to_my_friends/?st=jx7kr9p2&sh=bd95d6aa

so first of all, thank you so much for your replies and advice! i'm writing an update post because things ended up working out well, and because i want people to see my friend isn't actually a horrible person like people were saying she was.

i texted her asking if we could work things out over a phone call (we don't live in the same state, so our relationship is over phone and text). it turns out a lot of you were right and my friend was being pressured to ask me to wear a wig. her future mother in law found out about my shaved head and pitched a fit. like i said in a comment, my friend can be a huge pushover, and this woman is apparently a nightmare. she's also paying for vast majority of the wedding, so my friend felt even more beholden to what she wanted. that's why she told me she couldn't pay for the wig: mother in law refused to. neither of them knew how expensive a good wig can be, my friend only found out when i told her over the phone. that's also why our dresses, shoes and makeup weren't covered. it turns out my friend is mortified by what she sees as her mother in law making her look cheap and greedy, but she didn't want to tell us that because she's already embarrassed to be relying on her mother in law's money. (apparently it's her fiance's family insisting on a huge extravagant wedding.) 

that's why her reasons didn't ring true to me as well. she didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me that her mother in law was being so judgmental of me, so she basically blurted out the first things that came into her head. she assured me she thinks i look great with short hair and apologized for making me think she thought i look bad. 

i know people will question how i can believe her, but i've been friends with her for nearly ten years and i give her the benefit of the doubt. we've been there for each other through a lot and really care about one another. 

i'm still side eyeing the plantation wedding but i didn't tell her that because she seemed so stressed out by essentially being bullied by her fiance's family i didn't want to pile on. i do know for a fact that she only wanted that venue for the big oak trees all over the property, which are admittedly beautiful. i went to the plantation's website and they do acknowledge slavery's evils and even have a memorial to everyone who was enslaved there, so that makes me feel slightly better. 

i did tell her that asking me as a mixed girl to wear a blonde wig could be seen as racially insensitive and i explained why. she was horrified and apologized over and over sincerely. she wants to stand out from her bridesmaids in pictures, and she didn't even consider the racial implications of asking me because most of her bridesmaids are blonde. she's kind of oblivious to things like that (so are a lot of people!) but the few times i've had to point out something she said could be hurtful she's always been understanding instead of defensive. 

i decided i'm going to grow out my hair as much as possible for the wedding just to help her not get grief from her monster in law. it'll still be pretty short, so that's okay. she's fine with that too except she was worried i'll still have to deal with snide remarks from her fiance's family. i reassured her that after nearly a decade with short hair i've pretty much heard it all. by the time we hung up i felt way better not only about the wedding, but about our friendship.",3
"ma man that sold me a car called my insurance company and listed himself as a driver. now they won't take it off until he verifies that we don't live together. he's blocked my number.. i bought a car last year from a mutual friend that i didn't know well at all. everything was fine until this past june, when he fell into some heavy debt. he gave me a call sometime around june, asking me to take out a loan for him, to which i refused. red flag number one right there. after this, he began to harass and pester me for money (was already paying way more than i should've been monthly for this car). i eventually just gave the car back and that was that. i gave the car back mid july and purchased a new one (nissan altima) from a legitimate dealer. this morning i received a call from my insurance company (progressive), saying that this man has listed himself as a driver, costing me another $500. i calmly explained the situation, but they told me that unless he can provide proof that we don't live together, (we absolutely do not) i still have to pay it. this is absurd, how is this allowed? the guy in question is obviously desperate and trying to get back at me for giving the car back, but how can i provide proof for someone else? this is in massachusetts and i have progressive insurance.


update #1: okay so a lot has happened since i first posted. for starters, i should clarify some things. we signed an agreement that i would pay monthly increments for the title. until the car (30k) was paid in full, he held onto the title. initially he said i would be under his insurance, but only a few days after i saw this guy was kind of shady and switched to my own. i did not have the car in my name, which is why i was able to give it back so easily. i just thought ""screw this drama, i'll just get a new car."" today my adjuster happens to be ""out sick"" but i reported this man to both the state and federal insurance fraud agencies. a representative of progressive informed me that the man in question blatantly lied to my adjuster and told him we live together, and that he drives my vehicles occasionally. i have only spoken to him a number of times, so this is certainly not true. i've been in contact with a representative of both progressive and the insurance fraud agencies all morning and am finishing sending in documentation as we speak. i'm expecting a phone call and will update soon.

update #2: not much has changed since the last update, except everything has been officially reported with all required documentation. luckily i kept all of the text messages between us, which i attached to the reports i filed. with my adjuster out today (of all days, just my luck) it's a bit difficult to get this taken care of. after i settle this, because i am not paying an extra $500, i will most definitely be switching providers.",2

"(update) cease and desist letter after posting a review on yt and tricked by developer for address/name. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z5mms/i_do_reviews_i_reveiced_a_cease_and_desist_after/?utm_source=reddit-android

so it's been an interesting two months, after my post i started contacting a few attorneys locally and eventually had to call the state bar for a referral because of the type of possible laws not a lot of people handle that like a normal lawyer does that's usually family/criminal.

i finally found an attorney that understood what i was talking about and wanted a link to the reddit post and agreed with the majority of the top advice i received. 

he accepted a small retainer of $250 to respond to the cease and desist i received and a few possible future letters/calls.

he responded asking them exactly what statements i made that were false and requested exact times in the video that the statements were made. since i previously privated the video we had to give them a different link. 

he also outlined what will happen should they continue stating that during discovery he will be requesting all communication between qa, play testing, developers, and management to see if they were aware of any of these bugs/issues that may compromise a customer's experience while playing etc.

it also included a paragraph basically calling them out for reaching out to me and lying about ""swag and wanting feedback"" to get my information to send a cease and desist instead of going through the proper legal channels to obtain this and the fact that i still have yet to receive any ""swag"" that this is clearly the case.

also included that they need to preserve all the emails they sent to other reviewers because it's of interest in the possible upcoming legal action. he also requested they preserve all sorts or other communication between qa, developers etc.

so after he had confirmed receipt of the letter we waited and waited. nothing for about a month but then i received 3 large boxes containing games, posters, statues, a custom ps4 limited edition console, bobble heads, funko pops, just every piece of swag i think they have for 3-4 of their games and a letter saying ""sorry it took so long for us to get this swag out to you!""

my attorney then sent out another letter asking about the status and their position on the cease and desist and we received a letter back with only a few sentences basically saying they made a mistake and we can expect no further correspondence on the matter and that the video can be reinstated if we so wish. 

he sent out another asking about the lost ad revenue due to me having to private the video since they admitted it was a mistake. they sent out a check for $500 and some papers i needed to sign basically saying the issue is over and i won't sue them.

thank you la, i didn't get sued and after it all i came out ahead. i'm still not going to link my channel or the video or name the company in question but thanks for all your help!",2

(arizona). she accused him of rape years ago. she was 18 and he was 22. it was false and never happened. he was arrested and eventually convicted. when he served his stance and got out he was broken. from what he told me, he was heavily abused during his prison time by other prisoners. he tried to get back to his life and he couldn't. his record, his name on the registry and lack of options. he went from being a student in a top college in the country to having almost no prospects. within a year of being out, he committed suicide.

yesterday was 3 years since his death. this cousin sent word through a friend that she wanted to speak with me and seek my blessing on visiting my brother's grave. i said yes, but figured something doesn't seem right. i went and had a recorder with me and recorded the conversation. also had my boyfriend record a video of our meeting from a distance (it was in public). she told me she's sorry and my brother didn't deserve what happened to him. i asked why and pressed her for an answer, she broke down and said she didn't know who did it and she accused him because he had refused to lend her money she desperately needed and she was angry at him.

the voice recorder got everything, and the video also has audio in parts that match the voice recorder perfectly.

are these evidence useful in overturning that decision? i want to make my brother's slate clean. not only for his memory but also because he has a son he never saw (his girlfriend was pregnant when this happened, he lost his parental rights as a result of this conviction). his son should know this is not the kind of man his father was. if so, how do we begin the process? do we need a lawyer here, or do we need to go to the police?

what consequences (criminal) will she face? will she go to jail?

and, does my brother's estate have a claim against her for damages? of course this belongs to his son now although i don't know how that would work with respect to his parental rights being terminated (doesn't matter, as we'd want his son to be supported more than anything else). and can his son have a separate claim for damages against her? this conviction deprived him of a chance to know his father, because parental rights were terminated.

i know this won't bring my brother back but it can at least provide some comfort to us and to his son, and maybe making things more fair. so please help put me in the right direction.",2

the only ancestor he's mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we're a direct but illegitimate descendant of king george iii. the reason why i question this is king george iii is recorded as one of the few kings who never had a mistress. 

however, he believes it because there's a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of king george iii (we are descended from the woman). he mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.

anyway, off topic. i thought it was fascinating, and i love hearing what he's found. i brought up possibly using my christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. i don't think i was really going to do it, i usually use the money to pay bills.

silence. and it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.

my sister and i look at each other quietly, wondering who's the half sibling. my parents haven't said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. we look like our parents, the only thing that's different is my eyes. i have weird hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. my sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. 

i always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. i never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it's not fair i have such cool pretty eyes. 

well, okay.

dad starts first. dad (d), mom (m), sister (s), and me.

d: there's a chance 3ar3ara_g0rd0n, that you're not my daughter.

s and me: imagine that wide-eyed stunned look. my sister grabs my hand (i love her big sister ways).

me: okay, um... 

d: your mom never had an affair. this isn't some cheating story.

me: wha.. (i start to feel very sick).

m: i hoped to never have to tell you this. i was raped. the reason we're not sure is because your dad and i had sex earlier that day.

me: (i want to die, i start crying). everyone else knows though, if they left the table.

d: your grandparents know.

s: okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?

m: no, they wouldn't move forward with the case. 

me: he's still out there?

s: but obviously we're far away from this guy, right?

my dad and mom look at each other. 

m: it was my brother.

i felt so sick. i felt... dirty. i had to run to the bathroom to throw up. i couldn't stop shaking. my sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. we probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren't thinking.

our husbands were just stunned and quiet.

the rest of the vacation was just weird. if it weren't for my nephews, i'm pretty sure i would have just gone home.

oh my nephews are wonderful.

well, we came home, and i had to battle with the ""do i want to know?"" thoughts. i could get a dna test. but i couldn't do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. but it weighed on me too much. i had to know in order to move forward. so i asked my dad if he would submit his dna with mine. we weren't going to tell my mother if it wasn't the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. it was hard asking him to not say anything to her. he should be able to talk to his wife.

so we submitted the test. 

i am my father's daughter. i cried when i got the results. it was a huge weight off my shoulders.

i made a decision not to tell my dad - i wanted to surprise them. i kept saying i hadn't gotten the results back. i did tell my sister though.

i gave them the piece of paper on mother's day. i was going to wait until father's day, but i couldn't. so i got a blank card. 

inside i wrote: ""mom, open the paper."" she opened it and i had written happy mother's day, and happy early father's day. 

lots of hugs and tears that day, yah? 

thank god.

edit: left out half a sentence, oops. 

it was my uncle on my mother's side. i have met him. my sister and i were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. 

family did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. 

my parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn't go through with it. two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there i guess was his reason. plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn't believe her. 

my mom didn't go no contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel's back. why that long, i have no idea. those are her reasons. 

she did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. i guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.

grandmother is dead now.

this happened in louisiana.

"i (27m) found pictures of my girlfriend (23f) topless on the beach at night with strangers. a bit of background: my girlfriend and i have been together for 5 years. we have lived most of this time at a distance, because both of us did periods of study abroad, now we live in the same country but different cities , about 2-3 hours of driving away from each other. we manage to spend together almost every weekend, and we were used to much bigger distances when we were living in different european nations, so the distance we have now is no big deal. i'm currently working in my hometown (which is her hometown too), she is still studying for her master's degree and will finish in one year. recently i got a job opportunity in her city and thought it would have been nice to work there for one year and stay together. i didn't previously plan to go there, but i was contacted for a position by an ex colleague of mine and i liked the company. she's renting a house with one male flatmate and i suggested her to leave that house and rent a place with me instead. this was all just to test the ground as i wasn't even interviewed yet, but wanted to talk to my girlfriend before that. she told me she is not ready to live together and wanted me to rent a separate place, she said she would stay often at my place but wanted to keep her own too. given this reaction, i didn't want to move there anymore, instead she insisted that she wanted me to move, but in a separate house. this made no sense for me, because the job was nice but nothing i couldn't find everywhere else, and my hometown is bigger and has more jobs in my field, the main reason i wanted to move was to stay with her. i told her that given that she wasn't ready to share an apartment with me, i would look for jobs in other cities and go where i could find the better opportunity, in my country or the neighboring one. after we had this conversation, she left for 10 days to go on a vacation at the sea with a friend. 

&#x200b;

the fact: when she was on vacation, she partied every night and posted a lot of pictures where she was dancing and drinking. i was naturally a bit jealous but i thought she was innocently having fun. i'm also on vacation by the sea, in a different place, where my family has a flat, and invited her here when her previous vacation was over, so two days ago i went to pick her up at the airport and brought her here. the morning after she was showing me pictures of her vacation on her phone, and while scrolling she suddenly ends up on something she does not want me to see and locks her phone in embarrassment. the only thing i saw in that moment was a picture of her leaning on a guy, and thought that was what she didn't want me to see. at this point i was angry knowing she wanted to hide something from me. we stopped talking to each other for an hour then she came to show me the pictures and apologize. she showed me this picture of her on the beach at night, with 4 boys and another girl, going for a midnight swim. all other people were wearing swimsuits, but she didn't have one, so she was was with her underwear and no bra. she was wearing an open men shirt, borrowed from one of the guys, with her tits out in the open. i don't know the people in the picture, she says they are her friend's friends. i'm heartbroken since i saw that picture and i feel like my entire life has crumbled to pieces. i would have never expected her to do this to me, and i also don't understand why she would be so lacking of self-love to just show herself to strangers like this. i asked her for explanation multiple times yesterday and got different responses. her story is this: she was wearing no bra but wanted to swim and didn't want to wet her t-shirt so borrowed a shirt from one of the guys. she said she closed the  shirt and it just happened that the picture was taken meanwhile she was closing it. this makes no sense because she was actively posing in the picture and making a face for the camera. later she told me that she was upset for our discussions about cohabitation and wanted to do something reckless to forget about our problems for a while.

&#x200b;

i sent her away on a train this morning and told her i want to spend my vacation alone and told her i'm considering breaking up. right before she hopped on the train we both started crying and i held her in my arms for a couple minutes.

&#x200b;

i feel what she's done justifies breaking up, also i'm not sure if those pictures show everything or are just the tip of the iceberg. however, it's very difficult for me to break up. our relationship has been perfect up to this time, we shared a lot of intense moments together, thought she was the love of my live and always loyal to me, was planning everything for a future together. those have been 5 beautiful years and it's hard to imagine my life without her. however, this thing came as a punch to my stomach and i don't feel i can trust her anymore afterwards. is there a way to recover or are we done for?

i'm hating her for what she has done to me, but am terrified of losing her and would feel miserable without her. when i told her i'm considering breaking up she said she would do everything in the world to get back with me, that i'm all her life, and that she's ashamed of what she did.

&#x200b;

one additional issue: we have already paid for a travel to japan together later this year and can't get the money back. i want to go with her anyway. am i being too soft? how should i handle it?",8
"for calling a pregnant woman a c***?. i was at the bookstore the other day and as i approached the cash i saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. 

as i got closer i listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. she was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn't available at the store. she was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn't available. the girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and i could tell she felt bad. when the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a ""inconsiderate little bitch"". as the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said ""what's the point of customer service if they won't help you?"" 
at this point, i had felt horrible for the young girl and i knew i had to say something. so i looked at the woman and i said ""i just hope whatever you give birth to isn't a total c*** like his mom"". the woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. i said i didn't care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. she cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. he came in, didn't say much (i'm 6'2, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. as she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. 

now, i still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that i was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. i felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. the cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. she thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so i think she's ok. 

ps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. 

i still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying i was wrong in using the c word?

edit: a few people have mentioned that i should not have included the hijab comment. it was not my intention to mention her religion for brownie points, i meant that it was very upsetting to see her trying to hide the fact she was crying because she was so embarrassed, and she didn't even have the chance to get a kleenex because this woman was just relentlessly going after her. sorry if it came across as pandering. was not my intention.

"by cripwalking out of my maths class. no, isn't a joke. this happened less than 2 hours ago.

so you might be wondering, how in the fuck did i manage to cripwalk out of my maths class? why on earth would i do it? well, let me tell you. here i am, chilling in class, while we're doing simple quadratic equations, and one of our classmates could not even comprehend how to solve it. my teacher, of course, gets pissed, and then she catches a student chatting, which led her to losing her shit. she starts saying how we all copy our answers when doing work, and tells us that if we don't enjoy the class, we can exit the room, pointing to the open door.

i sat there hesitating for about a few seconds, thinking ""should i? nahh"" and then thought: it's the end of the year, nothing will happen and everyone would get a good laugh out of this! maybe. but not the teacher.

so i get up, put my books in my bag while everyone is giving me confused looks (including the teacher), and i shit you not, i cripwalk out the door, closing the door on the way out. as soon as i'm outside the classroom, the whole class is fucking howling, literally screaming, you could even hear it from the first floor.

i'm feeling all slick and shit thinking ""that was definitely worth it"", but then it fucking dawns on me. **the parent-teacher conference is today, in less than 3 hours. and i have to go to it too.**

"- i missed my daughter's award ceremony because of my son, she's still not speaking to me. this might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

i've been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. he's not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. he's been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it's helped somewhat.

their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son's main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

my daughter was graduating from college last year. a week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. i was obviously incredibly proud of her. she asked me to come to it and i said i would. 

her college is two hours from here. i hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. right as i was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. i couldn't leave, and he wasn't calm for hours. i'd left my daughter a voicemail saying i wasn't going to be able to make it. 

she called back that night absolutely livid. she called me a shitty mother, said i had two kids but only cared about one, that i'd missed every game and performance she'd had as a child and it clearly wasn't going to change as adults and that she was just done. she said she knows he can't help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. she hung up and that was it. i've barely spoken with her since. she didn't send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. she hasn't shown up for holidays and i've heard she's engaged but didn't call to tell me. she's cut us out, and in the one of three times we've spoken since she said it's easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn't have to bother getting her hopes up i might come now. 

- i've offered family counselling and all other manner of things. i know i wasn't a perfect mom growing up - i didn't make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. i'm heartbroken but i don't think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",3

"just found out my girlfriend 26f of 6 years was cheating on me while i'm 30m spending the holidays with her and her family.. my girlfriend and i have been in a serious relationship for six years, and we started doing long distance relationship about 1.5 years ago due to both of us being in graduate schools. things have been fine until five months ago when i found out she was using a subscription dating app. i was disappointed and broke up with her, but we eventually got back together because she convinced me that she didn't go on any dates with anyone on the app. i believed her because i know that she is a very traditional girl and she lives with her family. after we got back together, i felt that our relationship wasn't what it used to be, and i often felt neglected by her. she would spend a lot of time texting even when we are facetiming at night. she told me she texting her girl friends and i believed her. i went to celebrate the holidays with her family this winter break, and she was on her phone a bunch as usual. but i noticed that she wouldn't let me look at her phone and acting suspicious a lot of the time. she also told me she's going on a ski trip with a guy friend in march, but dodged questions when i asked for details of the guy. finally, i've had it and looked through her fb messages, and i found conversations of her flirting with another guy for the past months. i confronted her about my findings and she admitted to having a crush on the other guy for months but nothing happened... just flirting on the internet. plus the guy did not quite reciprocate the feelings. but upon further questioning, she told me that she actually met up with that guy two weeks ago when she came to my city to visit me (the guy lives in the state i am going to graduate school in). she told me that they only kissed that night. i asked her to show me her texts and fb messages, but she refused for several hours before letting me look through them. i found out that she's been texting and flirting with him the whole time we've been spending the holidays together, and she changed his name to a female name so i wouldn't be suspicious. she also didn't tell him that we were a couple again and still refers to me as her ex. she was apologetic when i confronted her and i made her cancel the ski trip and cease communication with him. she reassured me that nothing will happen since he lives in my state far away from her and that he's not interested in a relationship anyway.

i feel so hurt right now and can't fall asleep. she's my first girlfriend and i love her so much. her family treats me like another son. but the logical side of me knows that i cannot trust her anymore. i have to stay with her until saturday and i don't know what to do. 

tl;dr long term, currently long distance girlfriend flirted with another guy via texts and fb for months even during the holidays when i'm visiting her. she met with him once when she came to my city to visit me and they kissed.

update:
thanks for all of the supportive comments and thank you for those that shared their similar experiences. maybe i'm an idiot for missing all of the red flags, but hope is a helluva drug. we talked again this morning and decided breaking up was the best thing to do. it was an amicable breakup and we talked about what went right and what went wrong in our relationship (other than the part where she cheated on me). she pretty much said she didn't feel appreciated by me, and she lost her feelings for me after our initial breakup. we both agreed that she was wrong and that she should've broken up with me properly before trying to start a new relationship. she feels ashamed of what she did. i will still stay until saturday because flight tickets are crazy expensive right now and not economically feasible for me to fly home. but we will definitely be breaking up after this incident. being separated by thousands of miles and a jam packed curriculum from school will hopefully make this break up a bit easier. thank you everybody for your input.

"my daughter (7) keeps getting touched inappropriately at school, school brushing it off (washington). on a near daily basis, my daughter (age 7) is getting groped by a boy at school.  she says he typically does it when the class is lining up and when the teacher is not looking, or at recess.  so far he has touched her butt, her chest, and proclaimed ""we should have sex.""

we talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  this has not helped.  we escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

the principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""  the read between the lines comment was: ""the boy's parents are not taking the issue seriously.""  the principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

we are really fed up that the situation is allowed to keep occurring and that our daughter does not feel safe.  it shouldn't be up to my daughter to ""cause a scene"" when it happens.  what obligation (if any) does the school have to try and correct this issue?",2

"i suspect my step-mom attempted to poison my dying dad's food. i managed to procure specimen in question. what do i do now?. not sure if this is the right subreddit. sorry for the wall of text, but my head is spinning and i don't know what to do. let me break down some background first:

&#x200b;

my dad is currently dying of liver failure. he's in end-stage, at-home hospice care.  we have nurses and social workers that visit every single day in the hospital bed we set up to help care and clean him up. the man is incontinent and can barely move unassisted. he's taking light doses of morphine and lorazepam so that he can sleep. the consensus seems to be that he'll be lucky to make to thanksgiving....

&#x200b;

my step-mom has a very shady history....she has three dead husbands  prior to my dad from whom she collects monthly in the sums of many thousands combined.  there was a fourth man after that she got engaged to after a mere 6 months, who died under mysterious circumstances, and she fought to take as many of his valuable possessions from under the noses of his children as she could. (my dad would be the 5th man)

she's euthanized 2 of her own dogs and 1 of her own cats....herself. not through any vet or other official. she is barred from every animal shelter and adoption agency in the state as a result.

so with that pre-established pattern in mind....let me bring you to last night.

&#x200b;

she brought in a ""home-made"" tuna fish sandwich to feed my dad, because he barely eats anymore, and it's somewhat of a thrill when he requests something. he was lucid and alert, laughing and joking. in a matter of less than a minute after devouring half the sandwich, he began to have the most extreme reaction i've ever seen him have:  his eyes rolled back, he began to seriously convulse, let out a series of loud groans and moans....his face contorted, and he was completely unresponsive to all outside stimuli - lights, loud voices, touch, you name it. before i even put two and two together, she's asking him (a little too enthusiastically) ""do you see the light yet??? do you see all the pretty angels??"" (wtf????). he's been in an essentially catatonic state since. out cold for the past 12 hours. it was a transformation that happened mid-sentence as he was speaking. in tears, i begged him to squeeze my hand if he could hear me, but....no dice. i was truly scared and genuinely thought i was going to lose him right then and there. we called hospice to send a nurse over (instead of calling 911, which is what we've been instructed to do. they are on staff 24/7). she wasn't sure what the catalyst for this episode was, but she did say that his vitals were okay and that this is a normal part of the dying process, and that if anything, we will be seeing things like this more often, and that it could also possibly be the drugs.

but he's been on them for weeks, at low, very controlled doses, and nothing like this has ever happened. i'm just a lay person, but that did not seem normal, and it's very suspicious to me that it happened immediately following the food, like flipping a light switch.

maybe i'm crazy. maybe i'm reading too much into it.  but i managed to wrap up the other half of the sandwhich in plastic wrap, and keep it refridgerated. my first thought is to get it analyzed in some lab somewhere....but....where? is that even a thing? do i take it to the police and tell them my suspicions? a hospital?

with him being in the dying stage already, is it even worth pursuing??

&#x200b;

again, if it weren't  for this woman's history, i probably wouldn't think anything of it....

&#x200b;

any and all feedback would be much appreciated. i'll do my best to answer any questions as well. ",2
"is it weird that my gf (22f) ""tucks me in"" to bed every night? (21f). we've lived together for over a year now, we just had our two year anniversary, and she's the love of my life, i think she's absolutely brilliant in all sense of the word. 

our schedules are quite opposite, i wake up for work at 6:30am, she sleeps in until 1pm for her night shift. i always go to sleep first, i need more sleep than the average person anyway (about 10 hours a night) and i always have to be up early in the morning. she slips in to bed in the first hours of the morning - sometimes i'm already asleep before she gets back from work, but most of the time i'm just getting ready for bed as she gets home.

i'm not really sure how this came to be in our schedule, but every night that i get in to bed before she does, she comes to kiss me goodnight and tuck me in. i love it, i think it's adorable and i'm kind of a clingy girlfriend so i enjoy it a lot! i'm just wondering if anyone else does this?

recently we had a friend stay over (our place is too small to have many guests stay over so having someone stay the night is rare) and i went to bed early and left them to their netflix, and my girlfriend said she'd come tuck me in soon. i got embarrassed about it, like it's weird or something? i just don't want people to find it strange or gross, i don't know.

is it weird?",8

"for leaving my fiance over his reaction to me getting a student suspended. i am a librarian at a prek-12 school. i lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.

for any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. a lot. it's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. they don't realize what they're doing. usually i just say ""watch your hands!"" or gently move their hands away, but i don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.

one day, i was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. he stumbled and grabbed my chest. again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, ""looks like ms. aitaitaita is letting the boys cop a feel."" i went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out and grabs my boob. i could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and i took him straight to the office. the principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. the suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.

i told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. he said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. i pushed back because i think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because i weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. he also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a ""joke."" i pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me i should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.

i tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and i felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so i decided to break off the engagement. his friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. aita?

"by accidentally asking a married woman for nudes. obligatory ""this happened a couple weeks ago""

so me (21m) and my best friend (22m) have been best friends since high school. we're from the same town, and went to high school together, but ended up going to different colleges. anyways, i'm super close with his entire family to the point of when summers come around, i end up spending entire days over at his house, sometimes when no one's there. his family counts me as part of their own family.

so his sister (24f) posted a story on instagram about her texting her boyfriend (23m) asking for help with a word puzzle. it was one of those ""even when i'm sick and can't hang out, i still need help with word puzzles"" things. classic couple. well i take it on myself to figure out the puzzle. so i swipe up and i'm thinking of what it could be, when i realize the letters could spell out ""nudes."" eventually, i send it off as ""nudes? lol"" and put my phone away, thinking she'll realize what i mean and maybe she'll also be glad for the help.

a few minutes later, i get a message from an old coworker of mine (26f) that says ""oh my!!"" i think to myself, ""well that's weird, i haven't talked to her in forever"" so i open up instagram. turns out, while i had been sitting and trying to figure out the puzzle, instagram had cycled through to the next person's story, which belonged to my former coworker who just so happened to have posted a picture of her 3yo son. my heart immediately sunk. i realized my mistake, and went straight into panic mode, showing screenshots of my best friend's sister's story and the like. she said she understood, but at the very best she figures that i was asking someone else for nudes and made up an elaborate story to cover up.

tl;dr was trying to help a friend with a puzzle on instagram and thought the answer was ""nudes"" so i accidentally sent ""nudes? lol"" to a former coworker who had posted a picture of her 3yo son.

"i (f 28) walked in on my step son (8) touching my son (4). i'm so stunned, it hasn't even sunk in.

it was early this morning. my husband was already gone for work, but i went to wake my step son up for school. he and my son slept in the same bed last night, sometimes when my son has nightmares he goes into his brother's room.

i walk in and they are awake, lying down and my stepson is just like playing with him. i can't bring myself to describe in detail. my son was giggling but as soon as he saw me, my step son burst into tears.

he got up and ran into my arms. he kept saying ""i'm sorry, i'm sorry."" i told him it's okay. i didn't know what else to say, i was speechless. he kept pleading with me ""please don't tell daddy"". 

he was so distraught so i didn't have him go to school. all day he's been in his room alone crying. my son is fine, he's been watching cartoons and playing with his toys all morning.

i don't want to tell my husband on the phone, i want to wait till he comes home. but i don't know what to say to him. i'm so worried, i don't think he'll take it well. how do i tell him? what can i do? i know it sounds crazy, but i'm not angry at my step son i'm just sad and confused. i want both my son and him to be okay.",8
"i think my coworker's disabled son is stalking me. what options do i have? (ok).  i'm a high school teacher. i work in a very rural, very small school  and have been here for 15 years. ""dan,"" my ""across the hall mate"" has  been here 8. his son,""leo"" has some serious development issues, and  attended the school until he graduated three years ago. leo was somewhat  of a legend at the school. since dan was the football coach, leo would  serve as a manager at the games and the kids treated him well. leo would  often visit his dad's classroom before and after school and i got to  know him as well. leo became somewhat independent after graduation and  is able to hold down a very basic, part-time job that he can ride his  bike to from his home.

this past summer, dan and his wife went on a three week vacation for  their anniversary. they asked me if i would be a source of support for  leo while they were away. while leo was okay to stay by himself, he  cannot drive, so i would take him to get groceries and drive him to work  if it was raining. i also checked in on him every day with a text or a  call. the last day i was to be in this role, leo sent me a very  inappropriate text that included a photo of his penis. i told leo that  was inappropriate and that i would be telling his father.

i showed dan the text and he claimed that leo's phone must've been  ""hacked"" or ""played with"" while leo was at work. i didn't believe that  explanation, but i accepted it and moved on. the next day, my phone  started blowing up with texts from leo (more than 100 inside 4 hours)  asking me if he could ""hold on to me"" and ""take me for a ride on his 4  wheeler"" and ""kiss me gently."" i forwarded the texts to dan and did not  response to leo.

dan came to my house the next day and said that leo was not sending  those texts. he said he was going to take the phone and see what  happens. then, i started getting texts through some ""unknown number""  that were the same in tone and writing. a selfie of leo nude was also  sent. i called dan, thinking this might be something happening at leo's  job or something.

this didn't stop. i was getting 100s of texts a day from different  numbers. as soon as i blocked one, another popped up. i went down to the  store where leo worked and spoke with the manager. (i taught all of his  children). he told me that leo had been spending a lot of time on a  coworker's phone and he had already talked to dan about it two weeks  ago! so, dan knew this was happening and did nothing.

i changed my number, then school started and everyone was sent  contact information for all teachers. this included my new number. dan,  being in my department and a member of the faculty, got this  information. the next thing i know, i'm getting crazy texts again. i  said something to dan at work. dan said leo was ""harmless"" and i should  just respond to him because he liked me and the more i avoid him, the  more miserable it makes leo. dan even said those days that my number  stopped working leo became very angry and dan had to give him  medication.

last night, when i got home from work, my kids told me that leo had  come by looking for me. i was surprised that he had ridden his bike all  the way out here. the kids said he arrived in a car, but not dan's car.  my son guessed it was an uber. i don't want to sound like a paranoid  nut, but this whole thing is unsettling. 

am i being stalked?  
am i being unsympathetic to leo's problems?  
is it wrong of me to expect dan to manage his son's problems?  
what do i do next? 

i'm not going anywhere, and i doubt dan is, so we will be ""across the hall mates"" for another 10 years…

"for suggesting that my sister chose an easy love?. my younger sister and i were very close when young but no so much now. i was born in fairly well to do hindu family. i fell in love and married a muslim man and had to convert to his religion. my family was pretty pissed off that i converted but we've kept in touch.

recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. my mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

my sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. i was happy for her.

it all began when i asked what religion he was. imagine my surprise when she said that he was hindu and the same community as our parents. this would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

i asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. she got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
i suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

i explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. it was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

she told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and i was being rude. i told her that i wasn't, i was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  i then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
at this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. at this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. she called me 'toxic'.

i was just looking out for her.",3

"update someone i've never met claims they own my house.  hi everyone –
 
i can't thank you enough for all your advice on my last post: ""someone i've never met claims they own my house"".  this is the first update, and i'm hopeful there will just be one more after this, wrapping everything up so we can put this behind us.  this is what has happened since my last post:
 

after the initial letter from the law firm saying they can represent us, we started getting phone calls from other firms, saying they'd been alerted to the lis pendens and could also represent us.  we were not super happy with this and asked how they got our cell number.  they said they subscribe to a service that alerts them when things like liens, foreclosures etc. are filed on a property. we hung up.
 

we looked at all our documents from the closing and confirmed that we do indeed have homeowner's title insurance (yay!).  our deed is a ""bargain and sale"" deed, for those wondering. we also pulled all deed/mortgages and other documents for our property going back to 1972 online.  the last action was when we bought our house – no documents have been filed since.  i signed up on acris to be alerted to any changes made to the property documents (thank you for the redditor who suggested that).  i also emailed the da for my county, and their economic crimes bureau head emailed me back to ask for my cell number to follow up with me.  i gave it to him, but he hasn't called yet, so maybe that will be in the next (and hopefully final) update.

 
my husband met with our lawyer this morning, and i asked him to speak about all the things that you all suggested in the last post. prior to the meeting, our lawyer had reached out to the firm who filed the lis pendens, and actually got a copy of the court transcript where the con man said he owns our property.  according to the transcript, he claims he bought it in 2016.  our lawyer called their law firm and basically said ""where is the deed?""  they supposedly hemmed and hawed about it, so we're starting to think they don't have it, and never did!  they may just be going off the words of a sleezeball who's like ""yeah, i totally own that place.  i even have a deed for it.  no, you can't see it.""  it's possible that based off this alone, they filed against our property. 
 

in addition, it's not like this guy is saying he bought our house last week and the paperwork just hasn't been filed yet, he claims he bought it 3 years ago and there is still no paperwork filed to attest to this fact. (i was able to pull up all records for our home going back nearly 50 years, in about 15 minutes online).  our lawyer does not like the way this other firm is handling this, and basically said to them ""you have no grounds for this.  take it off.""
 

the attorney handling this case at that law firm is out of the office today and tomorrow,  but will be calling our lawyer back on friday.  i am hopeful that it will just be a matter of ""take the lis pendens off."" and ""ok"".  i'll update again after the call between the lawyers. i told my husband the number 1 question is ""where. is. the. deed?""  when we initially spoke with them, they clearly said they had it in hand, which is part of the reason i was freaking out. i honestly just want to be done with this, so getting back at the suing law firm for gross negligence (or whatever term fits the issue) is of no interest to me at the moment.  if they give us a hard time about removing the lis pendens, then we'll see.
 

so far my takeaway from this that i would share with anyone going through something similar is that law firms are made up of people.  and just like people can be good and smart and kind (like all of you!) they can also be dumb, shifty and lazy, and not bother to do their due diligence even though that's like 50% of why they exist in the first place (but i'm not bitter……).
 

thank you all so much for your help,  i'll update again as things progress and hopefully conclude.",2

original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/baec65/i_59m_cut_two_of_my_kids_24f28m_out_of_my_will/)

so i took the advice of the previous thread, which was overwhelmingly to consider setting up a trust for my two problem children.

before i even invited the two of them over to talk the issue over, my son called me to apologise for how he was acting. he seemed genuinely ashamed of the things he said and admitted that it was wrong of him to waste his mother's savings like that.

anyway, i invited the two of them over to tell them my plans. as i say, my son seemed very apologetic, while my daughter was clearly still upset with me.

i told them that i would reinstate their inheritance, but since they've demonstrated extremely poor money management that i will only do so through a trust. that i'd talk with a proper lawyer/financial expert on setting them up, and they'd be designed to provide for them and any future children they have over many years after i'm gone. that them blowing through it in a few years is simply not an option.

son took the news very well and said he wouldn't trust himself with that money anyway. i'm not sure what caused such a sudden change of heart in my son, but as i say it **seemed** genuine. he also offered to go to therapy for his sex/drug addiction if i helped pay, to which i agreed (i'll make sure this therapist actually exists, don't worry). 

my daughter did not take it well, christ. far worse than i expected. here i am willing to give them a second chance, and she just blows up about how it's not fair that it's only them that don't get the money outright. i explained that their siblings had demonstrated they were responsible with money and hence why i would leave it to them outright. nope, not good enough for her. she doubled down that spending all of her mother's 300k+ gbp on travel was justified. had the gall to again call me several extremely upsetting names and accuse me of being emotionally abusive.

so i told my daughter that as i'm retiring soon, perhaps i should experience the joys of travel also. perhaps i should spend ""her"" inheritance that i've worked for my entire life on travel myself. she stormed out and hasn't contacted me since.

really proud of how my son's taken the news. extremely disappointed in my daughter.

"by ruining a happy family.. like all good tifus, this didn't happen yesterday.

my wife and i went to one of our favorite restaurants in town a couple weeks ago.  it's just a bar and grill on the lake shore where you can sit outside right next to the water.  whenever the weather is nice, we love sitting out there and enjoying a couple beers with dinner.

one of our favorite parts about sitting out there is the wildlife.  from our spot, you can look into the water and see fish swimming around and ducks love hanging out there.  i assume people toss fries or whatever for the ducks, so they made this area an official hangout.

on this particular evening, my wife and i were the only ones eating outside and we saw a pair of ducks (a drake and a hen) swimming offshore.  i thought it would be fun to pull up youtube and make duck noises.  i found a video that had a couple different duck calls, so i started playing it.  lo and behold, the ducks responded.  at first they started by making the call back to me, but gradually, they moved closer and closer.  they ended up on-shore and only a few feet away.  it was a pretty fun experience.  that is, until it got out of hand.

apparently my phone was loud enough for other ducks to hear, because another drake swooped in.  this other drake had no interest in me, however.  he immediately went for the hen.  this led to a fight between the two drakes.  they started yelling (quacking) at each other and eventually flew off and chased each other around the lake with the hen following them.  unfortunately, the original drake did not win the mating fight and the new drake flew off with the hen.

my wife and i stared at each other in disbelief as this whole thing played out.  she still jokingly calls me a home-wrecker, and i suppose that's fair.

i'm not really super torn up about it.  in fact, i find the whole situation kind of amusing.  i thought this more light-hearted belonged here.

tl;dr:  went to dinner and played duck calls.  called in another drake and ruined a family.

"deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.. the update!!(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)

&#x200b;

ohhhhh where do i begin. this happened this weekend.

let's lay out some plot points first..

\-i'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. she is 26.

\-i work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. i've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-i've always worked out, done yoga, i'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. this combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. i've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. i know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, i've done it a lot and i know what i'm doing, lol.

&#x200b;

okay. so, the girl i am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. one of whom is getting married soon. she was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. i was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? i agree to the plan. i was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&#x200b;

there are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. this way, i would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. but the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (i can draw a diagram if needed.)

&#x200b;

so the day comes, i have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. by the time i arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. i prepare myself with the girl i'm dating, and she invites her friends in. they are hooting and hollaring as i'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. the whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, i'm really into this idea now.

&#x200b;

i throw my legs over my head as i've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... i circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. i put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and i hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. i'm trying to look back to see them, but i'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. i start getting more and more into it, and the girl i'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. at this point i'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. the girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&#x200b;

after a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""cum in your mouth! cum in your mouth!""... now to be clear, i normally don't do this. i have before, lol, but it's not my thing. but i'm the entertainment, and i aim to please, so in my mind i'm thinking lets do this. i start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. the girl i'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. the whole thing is so hot and i feel like i'm about to cum, and.....explode. it was a lot. i'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. the girl i'm dating let's go of my legs and i fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - i'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. so i stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and i look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. my assistant.

&#x200b;

she leaves the room, i race to the bathroom. the girl i'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and i tell her. she loses it laughing - ""so and so is your assistant?! ahahahah"". i'm not laughing. assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&#x200b;

it's actually a bit of a scene, the girl i'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling assistant and she is not answering. the girl i'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&#x200b;

i've been working from home all week. i've talked to my assistant via slack and we've said nothing. she is in the office. i can't work from home tomorrow. i don't know what the fuck to do. the girl i'm dating said that assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. i really don't know what the fuck to do.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - i sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. we haven't spoken about it since.

&#x200b;

edit:  the diagram(https://imgur.com/a/rr31ebi)!  i'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  i'm not a turkey, i promise.

edit 2: to clarify, i don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  i think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  the diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until i stood up.  at least this is the logic i am convincing myself of.

edit 3:  i'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl i am dating"" because honestly i wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  i don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

edit 4:  yes, they were staring at my butthole.  i'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. to be honest if,

edit 5:

since everyone is asking, i'll offer my thoughts.  no, i'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  it's my own dick, so i think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  by your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

as for the ""i've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i bring it back to the above statement.  a handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  i think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  but it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  better than jerking off that's for sure.

and yes, i have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

"cardi b drugging and robbing men makes her a predator. in a recently discovered online video, cardi b claims ""i had to go strip, i had to go, 'oh yeah, you want to fuck me? yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go back to this hotel,' and i drugged niggas up, and i robbed them. that's what i used to do. "" 

that is the work of a predator. maybe it isn't as bad as bill cosby, but as they both drugged people, the two can be compared. cardi b should not be a celebrated public figure.

as a stripper, you are already making way more than minimum wage. if you can't survive off of a stripper's salary, you should go ahead and crawl back into your mother's womb because most people survive off less.

"update: for arguing with my wife over her preferring to sleep with a body pillow over me?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/d8c3ic/aita_for_arguing_with_my_wife_over_her_preferring/

so a bit of a weird update since my wife actually saw this thread through her coworker. (e: to clarify, the coworker didn't know that it was about my wife, she was just sharing an interesting thread)

she texted me asking if i was looking to buy a new bed and i said yes without thinking much of it. she then linked me this thread and said we would talk later that night (not in a bad way).

we sat down and she apologized for calling me a baby and i apologized for starting a fight over something so small. 

she said that she really enjoys the pillow but we can get rid of it and sleep together instead. i told her this isn't necessary and that i would deal with it but she insisted. 

i've ordered her a new body pillow that just covers one side of her that she could put on the opposite side of me so hopefully everyone can be comfortable. 

everything worked out and we have been sleeping together for the past couple weeks now. the new body pillow came in and is on the opposite side of her. she switches between me and the pillow every now and then and it's not a big deal. a lot more comfortable to sleep now too haha. 


thanks to everyone who pmed me giving me advice as well as those giving advice in the comments. 

i tried to emphasize this as much as i could in the comments but seriously my wife and i never fight and this was extremely out of the norm for us. 

everything is good now though and we are going to start doing date nights again on saturday and it's been going well. feels more like our relationship when it was just starting out in the ""honey moon"" period kinda thing. 

but yeah, everything's fine now. to be honest it was always fine, this was just a minor thing that some how got blown out of proportion. i barely remember but i think we were both just stressed with work that day so we ended up getting into a silly fight. 

seriously i love my wife so hopefully no judgement by you guys on the one comment she said back then. she's honestly a really good person!

i made an update thread a few weeks back but was a few days early for the minimum and someone commented on the old thread a few days ago so i remembered to repost the update thread today with a few more updates.

thanks everyone :)

"middle schooler here- how do i stop my mom from posting my entire life on facebook?. this is on a throwaway because my mom knows of my main account.

ever since i was born, my mom has posted literally every aspect of my life on her facebook account. everything. every baby picture, every ""first"" moment, every accomplishment and every failure. if we get in a fight, she's on fb asking for advice. 

for the past couple of years i've tried to install an ""ask me first"" policy, but since i don't have a fb account of my own, this is hard to monitor. i can only really tell when i manage to get into her phone. the last time i did this i saw some.. grade related stuff. 

i feel like i have absolutely no privacy. i can't talk to my own mother for fear she'll post it on social media. i'm her child, not her dog, and i'd like to be treated as a human being. however, i love her and honestly think she is an awesome mom. this is pretty much the only thing she does that annoys me.

&#x200b;

wow, just wanted to say thanks everyone for the advice.  as expected i received a ton of different opinions, and i thank you all.  however some of them really helped put me in a better state of mind.  specifically those of you that opened my eyes to the fact that it may have still been abuse despite the texts, and even shared some of your own personal stories that relate to my wife's story.  it helped me approach her in a less accusatory manner.  

&#x200b;

i had a long and productive discussion with my wife last night about the things that i had found and that bothered me.   
 i told her i just wanted the truth, and that i wasn't angry.  she explained that while she was abroad she was partying and drinking pretty heavily, and at the time that f took advantage of her, she didn't fully understand what had happened.  she was in denial after it happened since she never expected a friend to do that.  she was surprised she even sent some of those texts to him, and she said she was likely drunk and trying to convince herself that it was okay.  when f finally left the country a couple days later and she had time to really think about it, she realized that what had happened was wrong.  she had told f to stop but didn't have the strength to physically stop it, she had no choice in the situation.  she also pointed out that once f left, she had stopped talking to him because of this, which was true in the texts.  they went from talking nearly every day to nothing instantly.  there were also some other things she pointed out that line up with the texts to suggest that after it happened, she took some measures to avoid having sex with him again(for example, sharing a bed with someone else when the option to sleep with f was available).

&#x200b;

i know some of you wanted me to talk to f.  but i have no desire to, and i definitely would have a harder time believing anything from him.  there was plenty of texts from f to w lying about me in order to give himself an opportunity with her.  he lied to her saying i was getting back with my ex(who lived 1000 miles from me, and had a boyfriend at the time), and told w countless times she never had a chance with me.  w had told me these things in the past and the texts all back that up.  

&#x200b;

my wife's story is consistent with any other time she has ever told me, and after our discussion i'm sticking by her side.  we discussed our other relationship issues too.  like i said, we had been struggling recently.  but the past month has actually been better than the previous 6 or so.  not perfect, but definitely an improvement.  she told me that the main reason for some of her actions and words was simply being pregnant, uncomfortable, and not having anyone besides me to vent her frustrations out to.  she was sorry for how she treated me and is going to work on herself to be better.  she wasn't mad that i looked through her messages, she even said i'm welcome to look.  but she promised she has nothing to hide.  whether you agree or disagree with me, i married this woman for a reason.  and while we may be in a bit of a difficult time, i believe we are on the right path.

"won $2000 scholarship from a gaming tournament while i was in high school. they said i had to wait until college to receive the money. the organization is shutting down. can i do anything to still receive my money?. **location:** i live in rockville, maryland, and the organization is based in rowland heights, california (i believe)

basically, i won this high school gaming tournament where the winners were promised $2000 college scholarship money. the other winners (my teammates) started college in previous years and have already received their money.

i only started college this year, but after contacting them about the money they have almost completely ignored me. they gave me vague answers about how they'll get this sorted out ""by the end of the school year"" (wtf?). i suspect that the organization has run out of money and is shutting down. their website is no longer up, and they are no longer running their yearly high school tournament.

there was no written contract, but the money was promised. they also made a facebook post after the tournament saying ""congratulations to this team (mine) for winning $2000 each in scholarship money!"", and included a photo.

thanks in advance! this is a massive amount of money for me (broke college student) so any advice is greatly appreciated!

edit: to make it clear, this is a small organization, not a big company

edit: i have been contacted by the organizers and they claim they are working on it right now... i think i will still pursue action, especially if they don't give me a definite response on when i can receive my money.

"for letting my picky eater child go hungry?. my four year old has decided to become a picky eater. he doesn't have autism or anything else that causes sensory issues, he's just picky now, he used to be willing to eat anything. if he had his way he'd only eat french fries and goldfish. obviously i'm not going to let him only eat those two things. i'm also not going to be bossed around by a toddler. what i've been doing is that if he turns up his nose at a meal, i'll just say something like ""alright, i guess you can eat this later"" and put the food in the fridge. if he asks for a snack, i offer him the food, and if he refuses, no snacks except for milk; at the next meal, i'll offer it to him then if he didn't eat it before. he carries on for a bit, but he eventually gets hungry enough that he'll eat whatever it was he was refusing to eat before. he's never gone more than a day of refusing to eat, if he did i'd probably feed him something else. my mom friends are horrified i'd do this to my kid, and tell me i'm old fashioned. i also feel like the worst mother in the world when my kid is whining about how hungry he is. for the record my husband is completely on board with this method. for letting him go hungry?

\-i do season my food and cook it in other ways besides steaming or boiling.

"for wanting my girlfriend to wear makeup and take care of body hair?. i know how the title sounds, hear me out. my \26m\ gf \24f\ takes forever in the bathroom. upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. when i playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago i was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. she said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. i told her that i got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that i also do to stay presentable. her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. now she's saying i have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which i find crazy as i'm not her sugar daddy. why should i pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?

i understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. i haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am i enforcing any ultimatums. if, as she says, i've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. if we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should i pay? anyone who says i'm ta, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? be honest with yourselves.

**gf's side:** he keeps being a dick about how long i would take in the bathroom, so as he said, i quit things he didn't even realize i was doing. no makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, i have curly frizzy hair so i stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. do i look like a beast? sure. am i a comfy, smug beast? hell yes.

he rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so i obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. i'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that i stopped, i feel like... why do i ever have to do all this shit. it's unfair. and if i have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. i conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. conservatively. he should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. otherwise it's not fair.

**both:** we love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. we recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.

**edit (from bf):** alright, i'm the asshole. you know, it wasn't even the people saying i *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying i wasn't. no way in hell do i want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think i'm not ta then i definitely am. my girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, ""in stained shirts and greasy hair"". jesus. the amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that i'm not ta and the reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man.

i think it's reasonable to say that i'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case i would either pay up or we break up. however, luckily, i am still very much into her. i would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and i think those who pointed out that i should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. as i said before, this was never a fight. and for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me i can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight.

**edit 2 (from gf):** thank you, reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. he let me shave his legs. he said he feels like a dolphin. i've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (i didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",3

i guess i can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what's worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. most american employers/career help centers i've met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won't go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

a few people have mentioned latex. i use latex often in my math coursework, but i'm not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. pages (on mac) has been sufficient for me.

as far as linkedin go, it's a less-detailed version of the master document i keep, as far as work experience goes, but i go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on linkedin than i do on paper.

"by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended. obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. my brother and i have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). this agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so i was convinced he still remembered.

a couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. i got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. i decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. there's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. so i went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""brother's name, if you're watching this, i'm already dead. everyone on the world pretty much is. it's been about eight months since you went to hospital name. you need to head for the safe haven in helsinki (we live in western canada) - mom might be there. god speed."" i managed to sync it up to the tv and woke him up as it was starting.

this is where it all goes to complete shit. my brother began to lose it immediately. he started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. i grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. nurses came in and i was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

he got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. my mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. my dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. i'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. i've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

worth the wait though.

3) i can see why people say i made this up for karma, but i didn't create a throwaway to do that.  if i cared that much, i would've posted it on my main account.

4) my mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. she hasn't been happy with me moving (western canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. she paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",4
"by causing an explosion 40,000ft above the atlantic ocean on an international flight.. i was running a bit late for a long-haul flight from delhi to london, so i quickly bought some snacks and shoved them in my travel bag as i ran to the boarding gate.

about 4 hours in (whilst half the people were asleep and the other half were getting annoyed that the tvs had stopped working), there was a massive bang and the whole plane launched into hysteria.

i can't even explain how loud it was, especially given the plane was in near silence. immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. it didn't help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn't see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. the people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.

after a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. my travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.

as it turns out, in india they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don't get crushed. they're also dirt cheap, so i bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks i'd grabbed in a rush earlier). the pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. 

and **that** is how i accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.

well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. you put half a candy bar down and yoink, gone when you come back.

they took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. at which point i assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the redbull orbit jumper.

obligatory gold edit: thanks all for your well wishes! ! a few things to clear up - mom went into the hospital on saturday. as of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in manhattan where she awaits surgery details. i'm in canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but i'm planning to head back down to ny this weekend to be with her. also....op is not a dude. :)

second update from my dad: mom's surgery may be thursday, with the holidays and all. i decided not to mention that i put the story on the internet.

fp edit - thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. i'm headed back to the states on thursday, the tentative surgery date. will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

update - mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. all of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

check out my adorable mom

"just found out that my 25m fiancee 25f has been bullying my best friend of 20+ years 26f.. hi all.

i've been together with hollie for three years and i proposed to her last summer, with a date set for springtime next year. she's an investment banker and the most gorgeous girl i've ever seen. we met on a night out. we moved in together after a year in an apartment that her parents are paying for. i thought hollie was ''the one'' from our first date, but now i'm not so sure. 

i'm best friends with a girl called sarah. we've known each other since we were little kids (grew up on the same street, parents knew each other, etc). i had a crush on sarah when we were kids and had feelings for her throughout our teenage years, and she claimed to feel the same, but over the years we both dated different people or had other things going on in our lives. 

when i introduced hollie and sarah, it was clear that they were two very different people, but whenever i'm around they've always been civil to each other. however, sarah has told me that hollie is always giving her dirty looks and disagreeing with everything she says just because. i never noticed the former but the latter has happened quite a few times. 

however, sarah confessed to me that whenever the two of them are alone together, hollie is actively cruel to her. making comments about her appearance, her background, her family, etc. i did not believe this and actually distanced myself from sarah to protect my relationship with hollie (who has been telling me to get rid of sarah when i told her what sarah had accused her of. 

i've not been that close to sarah lately because of this, however, some of my friends got together at my best friend's house last night. sarah was there and i brought hollie along. for some reason sarah left early and hollie was really upset about something. she started crying when we got home but didn't tell me what was wrong. 

early in the morning when hollie was asleep i got a whatsapp voice message from sarah which was 20 minutes long. it was a conversation between sarah and hollie which must have been taken yesterday. it started off ok, but hollie started to speak more unpleasantly for no reason at all. she accused sarah of ''hanging around like a bad smell'' and asked why anyone would choose sarah over her. hollie called sarah ugly and called her family ''scum'' and mocked her job (sarah is an elderly care assistant). she also told her that she'd make sure i'd want nothing to do with sarah. at this point sarah told her that she was recording all of this on her phone and would show it to me. hollie can be heard sobbing and begging her not to save the recording. sarah then said goodbye to her and hollie can be heard shouting ''you f#cking b****!''

after listening to this i was not sure what to do so i pretneded everything was normal. i made hollie breakfast like i always do. she's doing some shopping with her mom so she left in the morning and will be back late. 

i'm not sure what to do. i thought hollie was everything i'd ever wanted. she was perfect. but now i'm fairly sure that everything sarah has accused her of is true. the things she said to sarah on the recording were disgusting and nothing like the nice girl i fell in love with. i haven't spoke to sarah yet, because i'm struggling to find the words to apologise for not believing her. 

i'm not sure if i can continue my relationship with hollie. sarah was my whole world once, and even now i still care deeply for her. to know that my future wife wants - and is actively trying to - get rid of her is frightening. but at the same time i was so sure that hollie was who i was meant to be with and i'm not sure i have it in me to break her heart. 

should i break up with hollie or try to salvage something with her, and how to i go about building bridges with sarah?

"by being on this subreddit too much and hurting my boyfriend's feelings. anyone remember the of the guy that suck his own dick in front of his assistant at a bachelorette party? he included a drawing of how he did that.

so my boyfriend was doing some stretches on bed, and one of the stretches is the same pose as what that guy drew.

i commented about it and said ""hey that's how the guy sucked his own dick."" 

my boyfriend being silly then try to see if he can reach his too and i gave him a little push.
obviously he isn't as flexible (just like how most people are not) and i said;

""well it's okay, he did mention afterall that he also have a big dick""

and in that moment i felt as if time slowed down and i can see his face going into this super disappointed look.

and that is how i fucked up by hurting his feelings.


tl;dr: i told my boyfriend he have a small dick indirectly and unintentionally and hurt his feelings

edit: y'all need to chill. i never did mention that his dick is actually small (and to clarify, hell no it isn't).
to give more context, it all happened in a light hearted and silly mood. sure his feelings probably got hurt for a while (can't deny that horrified look i saw) but obviously i reassured him and we laughed about it. 

reason i posted this is because my boyfriend is the one that casually mentioned about posting here, and i am curious what kind of reaction it'll get

we are now both laughing at how worked up some of you actually got ;)

"i'm all for being kinky but certain 'kinks' are just a mental illness masquerading as being sexually adventurous. like if you like to be called ""daddy"" in bed it's a bit freudian, weird maybe, but i don't mind, you know? if you wanna be tied up, be tied up. have hot wax poured on your titties or snort coke of a dude's dong, i don't mind at all. 

but if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness.

"my 29m girlfriend 24f tried to throw me under the bus when the police searched my house. first i'd like to start with some background. my girlfriend and i have been in a relationship for a bit over a year. she stays at my house about 75% of the time. we have had no major problems before this point.

on saturday night, we were watching tv in the living room, and suddenly there was loud pounding and shouting at the front door. my immediate reaction was to call the police, but after a look out the curtains, i found that it was the police.

at this point i was extremely confused. i don't sell, manufacture, or use drugs. i have no firearms in the house. i do nothing illegal online; i don't even pirate game of thrones. i had no idea why they might have reason to be knocking on my door on a saturday night.

i opened the door and they immediately asked for permission to search the premises. i asked why they would think that was necessary, and they wouldn't answer. in turn, i refused to give them permission. my girlfriend repeatedly said i should cooperate. i said no, and told them to show me a warrant if they want to enter the house. they then informed me that they had probable cause and were searching my place no matter what i thought about the situation, and that their asking was only a formality.

the first thing they did after entering my house was pull my girlfriend and i into separate rooms and begin questioning us. i kept demanding they show me a warrant, but apparently warrants aren't even a thing anymore because probable cause can be literally anything when your local pd is backwater and shitty enough. 

i refused to answer any questions. i told them i wanted a lawyer if i was under arrest. i repeated that i did not consent to any searches of my property and repeatedly asked what their probable cause was--that there was nothing readily apparent (thank you breaking bad), and that they had no right to strip me of my privacy. 

my girlfriend, on the other hand, talked a lot. i didn't hear much because she was in the next room but i overheard her say this:

>you should check the back yard shed! i've never been in there before and i can't say what's in it...

at the time i could only think ""what the fuck is she doing?"" well, the police checked the shed, and found nothing (again, i'm not a criminal), and an hour + hundreds of questions later left. at that point i asked why in the world she would try to help them find criminal activity in my house, and she could only answer that she panicked and didn't know what to do.

i don't need legal advice. my mother is a paralegal and knows a lot of good attorneys. she's furious about the police conduct, and she doesn't even know what my girlfriend said to them yet. i'm incredibly angry at my girlfriend for saying something so unbelievably moronic, but all she can respond to me with is ""i panicked and didn't know what to do."" what i need more than anything is another perspective on why a person would throw their s/o under the bus like that.

does this seem like something that can be worked through, or is this just a huge red flag?

"john lennon was a piece of crap person and a piece of crap singer who doesn't deserve the hype around his life.. he was a known wife beater who often flew into uncontrollable fits of rage that he directed to the various women in his life.  lennon resented his son julian, and narcissisticly blamed the boy for a marriage he did not want to be in. after lennon divorced his wife, he took off with yoko ono and dropped out of his son's life for years. julian has stated that paul mccartney was far more of a father to him than john ever was. 

john was a pathological liar who claimed he had been raised in a working class family in liverpool when he was actually raised in a comfortable upper middle class home. he often claimed to be single during his early years of stardom, despite being married. he claimed to have met yoko ono at an art show; falling in love at first sight, when in fact, ono had stalked him for months before he gave in to her.

john claimed to have lost interest in the beatles due to paul mccartney's tendencies toward pop music when in fact, he had spent two years in a daze as a result of a serious addiction to heroin. together, he and yoko  destroyed the beatles, then he blamed the breakup on paul mccartney. 

he was politically clueless and gave money to publicity violent and radical groups such as the black panthers.

he was no better than an average guitar player who mostly confined his playing to the basic rhythm parts and his piano playing was amateurish. 
his song writing was no better;  the lyrics to strawberry fields forever and come together are pure drug induced hippie psychedelic babble.

lennon was a raging hypocrite who lived the do as i say, not as i do life perhaps more flamboyantly than anyone. all you have to do is look at his songs. lennon, who sang imagine no possessions lived a millionaire's life in a posh new york hotel.  lennon sang imagine no religion, while he was was obsessed with every spiritual and new age fad that came along, including hindu meditation, the i-ching, and astrology of all kinds.  and it was lennon who sang all you need is love, yet lived a violent, and angry life while abusing his family and friends. and it was lennon who sang about having nothing to kill or die for helped finance radical and violent political groups.

lennon was a piece of shit and the world should know this about him.

"if i don't share my rather large (to me at least) inheritance with my aunt and 3 cousins?. 

some background: my grandfather just passed away at the end of january. he was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. 

this is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. his only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. but to my huge surprised i was named as his sole heir with life changing money. with the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. 

here's where it gets even stickier. my mom passed away 6 years ago. she had one sister who i was fairly close to and from her i have 3 cousins. i don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" i have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and i don't know if they ever met him. to be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like i did. cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral i set up for my grandpa either. 


now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that i split the estate 5 ways. 

this is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:
no matter what i shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. if i do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. 

i can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. the first attorney strongly advised i do this. 

i do nothing. i am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. this is my second attorney's preferred course of action. 

but this is not about the legality of the situation. this is about what should i do and would i be the asshole if i keep the entire estate for myself. just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. i have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. i could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. 

basically, if i don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?",3

well lo and behold, they both ended up bidding on it to try to win it for a birthday present for me and they unknowingly got into a bidding war with each other!!! they ended up driving up the price by about $200 before my wife finally won the auction. they could have just bought it new in the store for $50 less then she won it for!

"resolved ne hoa tried to take my land. so after 6 long months, everything been resolved. this is my final post regarding this, already asked my lawyer if i could post this and he said go ahead. 

so here's my last update:  

https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7go96c/ne_hoa_towed_away_my_car_and_built_a_chainlink/


so the hoa board got a lawyer to respond to my c&d and they requested a meeting asap with my lawyer present as well. i didn't want to go but my lawyer suggested me hear them out at atleast. at the meeting, i noticed there president and some of the higher ups were not there. 

the board had no idea what the hell was happening and their lawyer was just as confused as them. after i laid out my timeline of events they thanked me for my time accepted all the financial burden of replenishing my pond, missing car (couldn't locate it), and damages. 

i got checks for everything and got my pond restored back in april and didn't really think much of it. 

i found out a few weeks ago from the new hoa president. turns out the old president, tresaurer and someone else had been stealing money from the coffers. they wanted my land to expand and put in a pool, clubhouse and etc just as i saw on their website. the old board fined everyone a ton of money to get all the cash together and buy my land. instead they spent it on themselves. they needed my land somehow so they thought they could just take over the land i wasn't using.


long story short, their entire plan fell apart after i fought back and brought to the other members of the hoa attention what they were doing. from what i've been told, they had to sell their house to pay back the hoa and have since moved away. the hoa has offered me market value for my land and i do plan on selling since i really don't use the land for anything and the money isn't bad.

i did not file any complaints with the postal inspector or anything, since the situation resolved itself. i got a new project car and for those asking it was a '98 supra with a bad engine. my new project is a '67 fastback that i plan on restoring to look like elanor. :)

"for basically telling my ex girlfriend that she's not as hot as my current girlfriend?. my ex (24f) and i (24m) dated 5 years ago. we were together for about a year, but then she dumped me out of no where for another guy and broke my heart. she and i shared the same circle of friends so i continued to be cordial with her for the sake of our friend group, and we remained friends until we graduated and i distanced her out of my life and no longer speak to her. i'm still close with my friend group, but they have drifted from her over the past year. i'll still see her sometimes when we have hang outs with the larger group, but i no longer speak to her and we just avoid each other.

this past weekend my friend had a pre-game/party for his birthday and she was invited along with our other friends. i have a new girlfriend (23f) that i have been dating for a few months (she is absolutely amazing, drop dead gorgeous, kind hearted, thoughtful, etc. i never thought i could feel this way about someone). i invited her too, and she knew my ex would be there but was okay with it.

at the pre-game, my ex had a couple shots, was maybe tipsy. she came up to me and my girlfriend and started talking to us normally. i was kind of confused as to why, but just went with it. she then says to my girlfriend, ""hey did you know me and ilovepotatoes22 used to date back in the day?"" to which she says, ""yes, i'm aware"". ex gf smirks very subtly and under her breath says, ""yup and he sure downgraded"" while looking me dead in the eye. my gf said ""wow, i'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me"" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. i was angry, i truly don't believe i ""downgraded"" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes i do find her more attractive than my ex. i told my ex ""i'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again"". 

she went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them i called her uglier than my current gf. i told my friends what actually happened and they understand but they told me i could have been a little bit less harsh. ex gf is apparently really depressed and has been telling my friends that she doesn't want to come to any of the hang outs anymore. am i the asshole?",3

"my daughter is dying of complications from cancer. my wife and i don't agree on final interventions. how do we come to an agreement on something as profound as this?. i apologize if this doesn't come across coherent. too much ugly crying.

we have been battling cancer for many months now. her liver has started to fail and despite all efforts we have been told by the doctors that short of a miracle she will likely die within the next 24hours. eventually we are looking at a few possible situations at the end. either her brain will stop working and she will die that way. she could also reach a point wher she can't get enough oxygen without intubation. the other option is she goes into cardiac arrest.

if she goes into cardiac arrest they can attempt cpr. we have been told that due to the tumor growing in her spine chest compressions will likely break her back.

if she needs to be intubated it is quite possible that the process would cause so much damage (she has already started bleeding in her lungs slightly last night) that she would essentially drown in her own blood.

both interventions we have been told have a low chance of surviving. even if we do she could have brain damage from high ammonia levels. on top of that she is still battling stage 4 cancer of a cry aggressive kind that will still likely kill her.

i don't want either of these interventions as i feel she has gone through enough. my wife wants to do any and all interventions needed. i don't want her to suffer any more.

i don't want my wife to resent me wanting this. we have tried to talk about it a few times but haven't come to an agreement. a part of me feels like a pos for not wanting to try anything but i just don't want her to suffer anymore if we only get a few more weeks/months.

what do i do to find common ground. i tried asking a social worker at the hospital last night but didn't get a great answer on how to find a compromise. perhaps someone on here has gone through a similar problem and can help with some advice.


edit: thank you for the advice everyone. my wife and i have agreed on a plan. we are looking at the final few hours almost certainly. please support childhood cancer research. no parent should have to go through this.

2nd edit: i appreciate all the advice and i want to give another update. firstly, my daughter is only 5. i don't believe she is capable of truely understanding her death. either way this all happened rather quickly. last week she was getting a few hours outside of the hospital and enjoying life. she was very alert and still strong enough to walk around with help. her liver failure is a  due to a rare condition called vod which came on her very quickly. within the span of 24 hours she lost her ability to communicate with us due to toxic levels of ammonia in her blood. 

she does still have a chance, albeit small, to come out the other side of this. the medicine to heal her liver just hasn't had enough time. she has already been intubated before a couple months ago and came out fine. 

my wife and i decided to try intubation again but say no to cpr. she was intubated a couple hours ago. so far she has stabilized and at the very least she is much more comfortable now due to the sedation than she was before being intubated. both my wife and i are ok with the decision and have agreed to no further interventions. 

thank you everyone for your love,support, good vives and prayers you are sending. we'll take all the positive energy we can get.",8

"for ""tattling"" on my boyfriend to his mother. my boyfriend and i have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.

since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. he'll sit on the couch and play video games and he'll only tend to her while she's screaming if i tell him to. even then, unless i'm in the middle of doing something right then, he'll ask me why i can't just do it instead. on top of that, he only holds her if i hand her to him while he's watching tv and she's calm. he stays up late playing video games but still won't get her when she cries, so i have to get up with her. we've talked about it multiple times, to the extent that i've told him i can't handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.

i'm honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. i put the baby in his gaming room and told him i was going out. in reality, i just went to the gas station because i felt like i couldn't trust him, and sure enough when i got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. i took a ~10 second video of this and after i comforted the baby, i sent it to his mother with an explanation of what's going on.

she called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he's upset with me for involving his mother and for ""taking a video out of context."" i'm at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but for sending the video?

throwaway because who wants this disaster on their mane account?

a little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)

we've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.

we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.

things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. so when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.

i'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. at first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.

i can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! he stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.

its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and i'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think i'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.

i haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? i'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?

what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.

what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? will i have to quit?

i dont even know what any of you can do but i feel like i'm drowning.

update: i'm still reading through all the responses, thank you so much. i had no idea i would get so much help and answers.

i've decided i'm going to send my husband this post, and ask for a paternity test. i'm hoping what you've said will convince him to come back to me.

"ellen degeneres is severely overrated. first of all, ellen is not a funny comedian, people always says she's ""one of the funniest people on television"" and that's simply not true. her show is literally made for american housewives to watch during the daytime and that's it. it's just her scaring celebrities + criticizing and embarrasing people younger than 25 for no reason + subtle racism towards asian guests + talking about herself and a little talking with the guests themselves. that's not to say she's a 100% horrible person, but saying she's overrated would still be an understatement.",6

i've spoken to several attorneys and law firms throughout the state and have settled on one and signed the papers and all that stuff today. i want to thank all of you for giving me advice on what to ask and look for when speaking to them all, it really helped in narrowing it down and figuring out who was the best to go with. i can't really give out a whole lot of information because we are just starting to gather all the pieces and put it all together. there most likely will not be any updates to this for quite some time.

to answer the endless messages i received about race, i am white and early 20's, the person i was misidentified as is also white but in his 30's.

i spoke to my boss and hr and will be back at work very soon and 2 months pay advance that will be paid back with ot. also my landlord was really nice and is letting me pay the back rent over the next few months in installments.

"for ordering jalapeños on my pizza intentionally to stop my wife eating it?. first up, i love my wife very very very much but damn does she drive crazy sometimes. i'm a big dude, i'm 6'4 and i'm always goddamned hungry. i'm a firefighter so i'm always on my feet and simply put, i just love foooooood. my wife always eats stuff like salads and nuts but she will always help herself to some of my food which pisses me off because it's just the right amount of food that i want to eat but she'll go ahead and take some. 

i've asked her so many times to leave my food alone and she'll get really defensive and say 'it's just a little babe, you'll be fine!' except i'm not fine, i'm hungry. and then when i'm hungry i get hangry and i snap at everyone cuz i'm goddamned hungry!

things came to ahead at our kids 3rd birthday party. wife said no to cake, despite me bringing over a slice
to her, so i gave that slice to my cousins kid who was on his second slice. my girl ended up eating the whole slice whilst i held the goddamn plate and then when i went to get myself some all the cake had finished.

lately my mil gave me the idea to just spice my food to stop my wife from taking mine, since she can't stand spicy food.  i tried that yesterday, i ordered pizza and asked my wife if she wanted one. she said no. i went ahead and got pepperoni and jalapeños, and predictably when it came she came over and got all mad because it was spicy and she couldn't eat it.

i told her i had to take drastic measures because i'm fed up of sharing my food and she called me a selfish asshole.

"my wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary. tl;dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. brought flowers to wifes office. found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

yup. tl;dr  says it all. my (35m) wife (35f) and i were married ten years ago yesterday. she has been working on a big project for the last few months. the last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. this is a career maker for her.

 i work construction. with the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. so i work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. if its raining when i get up i dont go in. somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. i usually hit the gym for an hour or two. thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. we go home. i go to the gym as usual. i cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. we really havent seen much of each other this week. i went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. not unusual for past month. 

i stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. nichole was at the receptionist desk. i told her i got here later than i wanted could she put the flowers on mehgans desk. she said ""i dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" she buzzed the door to get back to the offices. the place was deserted. i went to her office, the door was closed . i always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. i walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. she is giggling only as she can. saying""we got to get this done"".  i am gut punched. i slammed the flowers down said ""happy anniversary"" and walked out. i didnt hear what she said just went past nichole said goodbye and left. made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

i balled my eyes out all the way home. went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. i drove about 2 hours to a state park. i had no idea what to do . i just had to run. i hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. i dont drink much so i had no booze, i just sat there thinking. looking back i am glad i was in a rush, normally i bring a 45cal. with me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. the way i was feeling i might have ate the barrel that night. my phone was blowing up fom mehgan so i had turned it off. i left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. i called him back. he said meghan called him to check on me, make sure i didnt do anything stupid. we talked a bit, told him i got to think this thru, would catch up on friday.

so while i am thinking about this, i go over our marriage from the beginning to see what i missed. we come from completely opposite backgrounds. my grandfather raised me with my mom. he taught me about life. he had a little saying about everyhing. he told me marriage would be the hardest job zi ever had, you had to work on it everyday. god i miss him. we did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. they worked hard and my brother and i did not miss out on anything we knew of.

mehgan was born into money. not overly rich but very comfortable. went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. and she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. i would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  we met hit off started dating. i was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. we dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. her dad and i started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

she graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. we work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. i took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. we agreed we had to experience the others interests. she was really enthused about the more physical things we did. i kinda like the symphony and such. i own two tuxes now.

i look back and do not see any red flags. her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. she was paraded out in front for photo ops. invited to conferences when other newbies were not. at dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. she quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . this 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. she seems very happy. we seemed very happy. 

so now, friday, i am home. i called her. asked where she was, back at work. i being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. she responded since i would not talk what was she to do? fair enough. she will be home in an hour. so i wait. i want to save our marriage. if i am lacking in providing then i want to fix it. i want to ask why of course but i can not accept  a idk answer. how do i phrase this? what else should i be asking? i know i will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  what she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. thank you in advance.",8

"norway my classmate ordered custom sweaters for our class. the sweaters never came, and she got the money back over a year ago. me and my other classmates never got our money back from her, she has it all. how do i get her to give my/our money back?. over three years ago (january 2014) we ordered custom sweaters for our class. my classmate, let's call her frida, received money from us and then placed the order. we were around 65 people ordering, and it costed around $25 per sweater, so she got around $1625

long story short, the distributor scammed us and we didn't get the sweaters. frida was clearly annoyed with us asking about updates, and stopped replying completely to anything related to it. in august 2017 she announced that she had gotten all the money back a while ago, and that we could send her our account numbers and she'd send out the money asap. everyone were relieved and happy. after a few weeks, no one had gotten their money back from her and asked what was going on. one person said she got her money (frida's best friend), but none of the others as i know of. now it's over a year ago and no one's heard anything still, she hasn't posted or replied after she made the original post saying she got the money.

i sent her a pm the other day asking for an update. i said it's fine if she needs more time to do it for whatever reason, that i'm sure everyone's understanding, but that people just want a reply. that the silence is the frustrating part. she has completely ignored it.

what can i do to get my/our money back? i thought about telling her i'll report her for fraud if she doesn't reply or give my money back within two weeks. the report will most likely not result in anything, but maybe it'd push her to repay everyone?

&#x200b;

**edit since i cant reply to people**: thank you all for your advice, it's been really helpful. and you're right, the distributor didn't technically scam us since he did repay us after two years (or earlier if frida had them a while). i do know there was an attempt to get the sweaters since she wasn't the only one working on getting our money back and talking to the distributor, and also because we got pictures of the sweaters at one point.

i'm not going to talk to the folk high school since the nature of the school is that you take one year there basically studying a hobby you have. norwegians often call it a free-year to relax before going to uni, and figuring out what you want to do with your life. since we left that school three years ago i don't think they'd appreciate getting involved. if it was a uni or highschool i would, though.

we are all spread across the country now, but i'll message everyone involved and ask them if they want to take legal action against her, at the same time as i message frida letting her know that if she keeps ignoring us it'll have consequences. hopefully she'll be scared into just repaying us, and if not then i'll follow your legal advice on what to do next. i won't let it go even if she gives me my money back but no one else.

"by sending nudes to my employee group chat.. tldr at the bottom- 

well i recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). with that being said i'm pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. i also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

we have a groupme for the store i work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
the previous night i had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that i was with at the time. no biggie right? 
the next morning i had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. noon rolls around and i needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue i was having with a computer i was working on. 
i typed what i needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as i clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, i hit send without thinking and go on about my day. i should also probably say that by this time i was working alone and closing so no one else was around. the customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left i went to check my phone and saw i had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first i thought he was just calling me about the question i had, while the phone was ringing, i went back to look at the groupme, to my horror i clicked not just a picture from the night before, but the whole damn video. my heart dropped, instantly when i realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my ""intentions"" where with the video and that he's never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. i tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. lol on the bright side the coworker i had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂

"for requesting prayer breaks at work because my religious coworkers do even though i'm not religious?. i'm an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. 

i have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. i would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. 

they get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don't need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  

i used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work i do. she couldn't give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. 

even though i'm a known atheist i decided i too wanted some time to meditate everyday. i told my manager i needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. she initially said no, and then i got a hastily written email saying of course i was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. she'd obviously checked with hr and covered her ass. 

for the last six months i've been having my 30 mins 'meditating' out in our company garden everyday. this has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have 'meditative time' and it's causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. 

i recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that i was being rude and 'ruining it' for everyone else and that at xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. i told her i'm not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",3

"if two drunk people have sex it makes no sense for people to validate one person as being assaulted or raped. i see this more when its a girl accusing the guy of rape, but the fact that its socially accepted is horrifying to me. if two parties are both wasted and have sex how can one person be a rapist? the logic of too drunk to consent would make them both rapists? i will never understand this or accept it. i agree that there are some situations where maybe past behaviour indicates rapey tendencies but if its a one off event and the girl is accusing the guy of rape that should rightfully be taken with a grain of salt if they were both drunk. reduced judgement capacity due to intoxication would apply to both parties and its purely the social construction of women being vulnerable or weak that assumes the woman was taken advantage of by the man. i cannot express this to people without being called anti-women (im a woman yall) or brainwashed by patriarchal western society. 

edit: i've read some of the comments on my post and there are some things i think i should clarify. i absolutely am aware of the low conviction rate of rape cases but people seem to forget the power of social media and in general gossip which is a different kind of punishment that follows you for life. i have also personally seen someone be accused of rape after a drunken hookup and because theres an assumption that questioning anything a possible rape victim may say is considered callous and generally horrible everyone rallied around her (except me) regardless of what we all saw. im not commenting on the efficacy and complexity of the legal system as it pertains to rape cases, but making an observation based on what i have seen and what i believe to be an ultimately illogical line of reasoning in this very specific situation.

"for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her african american boyfriend to her grandparents?. let me just preface this by saying this: **i have absolutely no problem with interracial relationships.** now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

my daughter (anna) has recently started to date an african american man (jamal). while i'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, i'm happy. the problem is anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. while her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. as i said, i have no problem with mixed relationships and i've set them straight, but i am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

my parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and anna expressed a desire to introduce jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. i told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. i may have no problem with jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. they might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. anna was extremely upset by this and implied i was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

as i said, i know my parents. they simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if anna were to bring jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

anna is currently staying with jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. my wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when i introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend i confided in told me that i have behaved like an ass and that i needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

"boyfriend and i slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out. this happened in ontario, canada.

so this past friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

i found out about it the next night at work (i work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and i were the night before. he filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

for more context, on the 24th of october a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. it has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (i sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

all we asked for was the alarm for our unit. luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

i dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. my dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. but i don't know. came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in ontario. 

edit: more direct questions; should we pursue action and report? if we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? i know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. i could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

tldr: boyfriend and i were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

"alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn't have the social acceptance it does.. alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven't done many drugs. it slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. in high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance i've ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

there is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don't seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

i really don't have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower iq and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren't drinking and to clarify i don't mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a slight buzz regularly.

"by accidentally assaulting a child in a public park. so today was pretty f*cking eventful. 

first, obligatory backstory: my best friend and i often go out on weekends, get drunk, party at clubs, etc. it's a lot of fun when everyone's enjoying themselves and letting loose. one weekend, my best friend's older brother came home from croatia ( first time in a couple years) to catch-up with the fam and had plans with him to go out on the weekend. he offers me if i want to come but i want them to have quality bro time so i pass, truly wanting them to catch-up and have some family time.

it just so happened that weekend of all weekends that my best friend (we'll call him l) got into a fight with another group of guys. although he and his bro didn't sustain too much damage from the fight (the other group were wasted from alcohol and pills) l and i got into talking about joining a martial arts gym. it would be for fun and fitness, plus, learning how to defend yourself seemed smart.

we caught up and chilled at a local public playground (keep in mind, imagine two grown ass young adults climbing up and around a tiny playground in broad daylight) and began discussing joining a local kickboxing gym. being best friends, we started talking some sh*t, saying how much we'd deck the other and how we'd essentially easily f*ck the other up. we began to mock fight in public with parents and children walking by on the sidewalk with amusement tinged with judgement. 

it was just two 18yr olds messing around. 

all of a sudden, i say something stupid in a mock japanese accent (i'm asian.. chill) and proceed to attempt a jumping, flying, roundhouse, no-idea-where-the-f*ck-my-legis-going kick at l, when this child that couldn't be over 8 jumps in and says ""hiiyaahh""

i couldn't stop my momentum and proceeded to yeet this kid into the sandpit... 

no amount of bracing could protect our ears from the banshee scream that erupted from his mouth.

i went into instant panic mode, running to the kid to check on him. he wasn't seriously injured, but my leg collided pretty hard. 

his older brother or something came over, laughing his ass off. i apologised profusely to both the kid and his brother, and when he stopped crying i talked him up about how strong he was to take such a ass whoopin.

his bro lightly scolded him for running into an area where two tall dipshits were flailing their legs and fists. all in all, it was pretty wholesome, the child had a new story to tell at school, and i got to kick a child in the face... win-win.      (that's a joke)

tl:dr
best friend and i were pretend fighting in a public park and when i attempted to do a ridiculous kick i saw on ufc, a kid jumped in and became collateral damage. worth it.

edit: holy shit, thanks for the silver and gold, i am not worthy of this. i made this post at 12am last night and when i woke up, i was not prepared for the absolute ass load of humorous and kind comments. 

i appreciate you all!

edit #2: i didn't make one point clear enough regarding the playground. besides people walking past the area on the sidewalk, the playground was empty. l and i made sure that our presence wasn't making anyone scared or uncomfortable, if there were children already playing, we wouldn't have even entered the playground area at all.

ever since i moved out and laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. she's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

i am fine with what laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

i tried to talk about this privately to laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. my son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. the moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. people were obviously listening and when i gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because i was jealous of her confidence. to make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that i was a piece of shit for saying what i was. my son and i left in tears but laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

ever since then i've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and i was a bad person for asking laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. i'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if i've gotten old and out of touch. it just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this. for speaking to my ex this way?",3
"a former air bnb guest put a hold on my mail for everyone at my address and has been paying to hold the mail for 2 months! (texas). its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  one guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  a lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  one lady missed the receipt of a death certificate.  we thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  so i tried calling the usps and that got me nowhere.  going down in person was the only way to do this i guess.  turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal po box?  who knows.  the post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  still, how could this have happened?  surely this can't be legal.  i got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  she hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one. 

edit:  well that was quick~!  the post office called me directly before i could even report her and pro-actively already reported this lady to the postal inspector.  they're very certain what she did is illegal.  thanks /u/beamdriver for the advice!  important lesson here kids:  don't fuck with people's mail, because the usps apparently is the most effective law enforcement agency there is.  

edit 2:  omg this made it to the front page?  not what i expected from a post that was solved on the first comment.  thanks for your updoots everyone!  ",2
"by swiping on my girlfriend's phone nsfw. so this happened a few days ago and i'm still not sure i'm 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

i've been with my girlfriend for about a year and i already know she is the love of my life. she's perfect for me. we're perfect for eachother. we're getting ready to move in with eachother and i want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

we went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

she went to the bathroom while i had her phone, and as i was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. if you have an iphone you know what i'm talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you're back at the start of the photo album. it's annoying as hell.

but some photos caught my eye. some photos that i really shouldn't be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

there she is, the love of my life, trying to get her mouth around the biggest dick i've ever seen in my life. i've watched porn - a lot. i've never seen a dick like this. i'm talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. longer and thicker. as far as i could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

i could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

i closed the pictures and i've acted like nothing has happened, but i cannot get these images out of my mind. i've never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats i'm significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

we haven't had sex since. i can't concentrate on my work. i just wish i had never seen those damn pictures.

tl;dr accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

update: there's a lot of people assuming that this was a one-night-stand. it wasn't. she was with this guy for 3 years.",4

"for honking at another driver who cut in front of me at a drive thru each time she tries to order. this line at a starbucks i went to was really long. i was in line for a good maybe 20 minutes. until this lady in a mercedes tries to cut in front of me and like 8 others behind me. i laid on the horn and tried to block her from cutting me but she succeeded anyway and flipped me off. 

okay. i'm the type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. so i waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, i honk. she then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which i already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. each time she makes an attempt to order something i honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. we stopped as soon as she drove off. we then ordered and went about our day. 

i just can't people who are extremely rude like that lady and i couldn't simply let this go.

"i(22m) recently discovered my dad (50m) choose me over my former stepmother and half-sister(17f) 6 years ago. don't know how to process this.. i was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. when i was sent to live with my dad, i was broken. i barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  i wasn't mad or angry. i was null of any kind of emotion. basically i was alive but wasn't living. i kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. i was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. i was more social with my dad but i kept it to a bare minimum.  i had noting left to say to anyone. it took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. that's how withdrawn i had become.

dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  when i experienced night- terrors, i would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  he drove me to all of my therapist appointments. he made sure i was eating properly. there were days, i would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. he literally went above and beyond for me. i hated the city that were living in. because  i had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

i was so passive, it was scary. my therapist had told my dad that i was stuck in the victim's cycle; i didn't know how to get out. because of this, i was bullied quite a bit. by the time i was 15, i had been to 3 different schools. it got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. i was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. noting would motivate me.

looking back, dad did spoil me but at the time i wasn't aware of it. i was so in my own body that i barley acknowledged my surroundings.   if i asked my dad for a new bed spread, i would get me new one plus new furniture. my phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. i was grateful and thanked him. i did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. again i was being polite. i didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. i barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

by the time i was 16, dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. i didn't question it. he had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. i didn't think it was any of my business so i didn't press the issue. a year later, dad had divorced my stepmother. one of dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in boston and he took it. we moved and i felt i was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. that year was probably the best year of my life. i was coming out of my shell. there was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. it was if i was like everyone else. i felt ""normal"". i became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, i was going out more. us moving probably saved my life.

because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. there was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. you could just sense it. it got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

me and dad have always been close. when i had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, i could see my dad crying in the crowd. i lived with my dad while i attended college ( i still do for the time being) . ever since i was child, i always wanted to be a doctor. well, i just finished my first year of medical school. honestly, i feel like a normal young adult in society. i have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom i've been with for 4 years. i'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

recently, i got fb message from my half-sister. she was apologizing a lot and i had no clue what she was talking about. turns out, the reason why dad and i moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what i was watching her change........... yes. she told her mom that i was watching her change.. at the time, i was traumatized of sex. heck i was terrified of any form of intimacy. the kid was envious of what dad was doing for me. she was so envious that she tried to move me out. well i guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and i'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. because we moved out, i think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. how can someone be so cruel? what did i ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. i didn't even respond. more importantly, dad never let this to get back to me. chances are if i had heard about this when i was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. it also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

this is a lot to take in and i have a new found of respect and love for my dad. he gave up this marriage for me so i could live a normal life.dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. i'm missing him a lot lately.

should i bring it up to him when he returns? also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? at the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and i almost want to help.

tl;dr: dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. dad kept it from me for 6 years. should i bring up with him?

edit: i wasn't expecting such a huge response. i just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. it will take some time but i will read all of them or as much as i can. as i was going through the comments, i found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. this a part of my life. i don't normally like to talk about about this . aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. the fact the people are saying that it's fake.... i don't what to say. it's not my place to try and convince anyone. believe  me, they're times i wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. when i wrote this, i wasn't thinking about syntax. it was more just getting this out. people questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. forgive me but i wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

as for how i became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; i did respond to it in the comments but i'll post it here too. 

""it was very unorthodox how i became valedictorian after attending a real hs for only a year. my overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because i was in online classes for my previous hears, i wasn't eligible at the time. i met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

i broke down in front of the coordinator and i told her the truth. being named valedictorian was something i always wanted. to be that would have been my first accomplishment that i would have achieved based on my own merit. yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. it wasn't trying to be valedictorian financial reasons. money wasn't a problem (dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. this would have helped me self-worth as well.

the girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and i told her the truth. she actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. it something i'll forever be grateful for. that's actually how me and her became friends."". not many people would do that and in hs. 

i'll be posting again. i just need a few days.",8
"update i've been putting off introducing my 28m girlfriend 26f to my parents 60sm/f because they'll be weird about her weight. op(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh673p/my_28m_parents_60s_mf_are_about_to_meet_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

thank you to the many commenters who offered good advice. including to call in advance and  let my parents know how it was going to go down if they wanted a role in this new part of my life. 

went like this. paraphrasing of course. 


me: hey mom and dad, you know i mentioned a girlfriend a few times. we're moving in together so i'm thinking i'll bring her out. 


mom: oh that's nice. first week of december maybe? 


me: sure. look there's one thing though. she's not thin. if you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we're done, we're going home. i love her. and she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so i expect you to show her the same respect. 


mom: but you have so many prospects and a good job why would you—


me: no. this is exactly what i'm talking about. 


mom: fine. i'm just happy i finally get to meet her. 


dad: *insulting weight related comment*


me: what the fuck dad? 


mom: oh babe give it a rest, it can't be that bad. 


me: no if there's any chance of that sort of commentary, i'll just not come. i have zero tolerance for this. you're going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won't get the chance to screw it up. 


dad: *insulting joke* 



me: ok, bye. if you wonder why brother is buying a tux for a wedding you've heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. 



mom: no, wait, i'll make sure his act is together by the time you're out here. 


dad: *insulting comment* 



me: i'm hanging up. 


so it looks like i'm going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. probably not soon. my girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and i started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said ""it would be nice if i could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won't be possible and it definitely isn't worth putting you through this.""

so thanks for the comments and help. for now it's a non issue it turns out. 


*tl;dr: my dad couldn't even hold it together through a phone call so my mom will meet my girlfriend some other time, my dad is affectively disinvited in the event we get married, and we're just going to let this go for now.*",8
"kevin hart should not have stepped down over what he said in 2008. dear americans,

just because one man makes a gay jokes 10 years ago doesn't mean he should have to step down from hosting a huge event. i'm not american and i know and understand your country is one of, if not the most sensitive countries on earth but over 10 years ago? 

what you're doing is making people who tell jokes like this tell them in private, you're not helping in your cause. being offended is a choice and i'm sure you americans can choose to ignore old tweets. back 2008 you could still go on stage in a stand up comedy club and say the word faggot in a joke and people would laugh.

an apology isn't enough anymore. people must now bow down to thy shoe of thy offended because their ego is that fragile. 

oh how times have changed. well, you got your way..happy now?

"lpt request : do not request one hour dry cleaning if you can help it.. as a dry cleaner, i can tell you that it take an average of 1 1/2 hours for a proper dry cleaning cycle to complete: a double bath (rinse and cleaning with detergent) and a drying cycle. if a dry cleaner is offering an hour service, something was skipped. 
it take an average of 110 seconds to press a pair of pants, so take that into consideration too. that is if all the stains came out on the first try. most likely, they need to be spot treated on the spotting board by a professional spotter to remove some stubborn stains. and that may or may not need to be cleaned again with pre-spot spray treatments to get that last stain out.
usually, a dry cleaner who offers  an hour service have to shorten the washing cycle and skip pressing the clothes and just steam them while on a hanger to get them out on time. they have to also make time for tagging, bagging and racking and inputting the order into a computer or some system for pickups.
in summary, dry cleaning itself needs to be done in 45 minutes (2-3 min rinse and 35 mins for drying and the rest for extraction spinning and cool down) and the rest for processing if the staff is on top of things.
before, it was possible cause perc was a strong enough chemical to wash like water, but most dry cleaners have switched over to an alternative dry cleaning solvents away from perc by now, especially in california. 
so if you want your money's worth, do not ask for an hour of dry cleaning. (i've been in the business for 16 years. )",9
"bunnys are no easter gift.. with easter coming around again there are many bunnies gifted away to children in too small cages and most of the time alone, and not neutered and/or spayed. 

some facts for y'all.

bunnies are as much work as a cat, if not even more! (ok, it seems they are much more work than a cat)

they poop. a lot.

you need to clean their toilets. a lot.

you need at least 2 bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be spayed*)


bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.

bunnies are not for picking up! they are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!

they need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.

you need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)

this post was created because my sister wanted to gift 1 bunny to my nephew and i had to talk her out of it, so please don't gift bunnies they are a fuckton of work.

"co my ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. she now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. i want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible.. me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. there were a variety of reasons for this that i wont get into here. one of them though was her anti-science beliefs. she's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200b;

we have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. my ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. and threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200b;

around this time i also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. when this happened i decided i wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. the only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. my ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. the judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200b;

ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" i demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. so, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. she somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. i have been stressed out from the minute i got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. my daughter must have picked up on this and thought i was mad at her because when i was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200b;

turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. she made my daughter lie about it. instead she has been using ""special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" what about the forms i got saying she was vaccinate? there fake. i called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. so my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200b;

i'm pissed to say the least. my daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. my ex doesn't know i know yet and i told my daughter not to tell her, i want her gone now. how do i approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. i have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. i also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones i have a forged. i'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but i would like to know going in what to do. thank you.",2
"my boyfriend (21m) hates my (20f) vagina with a passion. i recently became sexually active with my boyfriend and he told me that sex feels very pleasurable but he doesn't like my vagina. he said it just looks unappealing and he doesn't wanna touch it or put his mouth on it or anything. he gave me oral once but he seemed very disgusted so i didn't push him to continue until i finished and i said he could stop. he doesn't like fingering me either. he basically just said that he doesn't like looking at it or anything. he said the folds are weird and it looks nasty. 

so i thought i had a vagina that looked similar like the ones in porn. my inner labia are not long or stick out and i'm an innie or whatever. i taste and smell fine. i think he just doesn't like vaginas. but he has a very high sex drive and he wants to have sex like 24/7 but it's just him fucking me and playing with my boobs. no attention down there. i do cum but i have to touch myself because he won't do it. it's just basically like he's having sex with me and i'm masturbating like rubbing my own clit so i can get off too. i don't wanna force him to do anything he doesn't like but is he ever gonna get over this aversion to my vagina? he's 100% straight and he likes boobs and he's attracted to girls and he likes when i wear sexy underwear and he likes looking at me naked from the front and he likes having sex. he just thinks vaginas are ugly looking. his penis is not beautiful i still put it in my mouth and touch it and give him a lot of attention because he enjoys it. idk it's weird. 

my friends boyfriends are obsessed with their vaginas. my friend told me that her boyfriend always begs to let him eat her out and they're always touching them and they worship them down there and sorry to sound gross but they always lick them out. not only that, their boyfriends are not grossed out about anything. my friend told me her boyfriend is always asking to tongue her asshole and he fingers her there sometimes. my boyfriend doesn't even like to ever look at my butthole. my boyfriend thinks it's disgusting if i get too wet and he said it's like a swamp down there and he wipes me off with a tissue and he always gets mad if i drip onto his sheets and dirty them. he will only touch me momentarily for 2 seconds to find where to put his dick and that's it. i get jealous sometimes. i wish he would be more accepting or loving or something. it sounds so stupid but writing this out is making me wanna cry. it's like he hates me for having a vagina or something. he's never even looked at it properly since the first time we had sex and he was very visibly disgusted. g",8

a friendly redditor u/kevindavebob suggested i post on so thank you for the great idea (and for being nice to me). this is certainly a and it all just happened so i'm still feeling pretty terrible about it.

i have a rare disease called usher syndrome that is causing me to go blind and deaf. one of the ways i cope with having this disease is by traveling whenever i can to create visual memories before i go blind. i went to iceland to try to see the northern lights. i can't even begin to describe the feeling of actually being able to see the northern lights. i didn't know if it would be too late for me to see them. 

i really wanted to share my story about going blind and seeing the northern lights, hoping to generate awareness for usher syndrome. only having a phone camera and being a very amateur photographer, i certainly can't capture the beauty and experience of witnessing the lights. i was able to find a public use image on the internet that would properly convey my story and experience. the photo has been linked so many times that i didn't spend time searching for the original source (you can see where this is going….).

with my genuine caption, generic photo, and source to my story and blog (no ads) in the comments, i posted in r/pics. i chatted with a few kind redditors about my story and was really happy to see people learning about usher syndrome. then i went to sleep….

well, all hell broke loose.

my post made it to the front page of r/all. #1 in fact. i woke up to thousands of hurtful messages and comments – calling me a liar and telling me i don't have my disease, redditors telling me they're happy i'm going blind if it is true, that i should kill myself, etc. (there were some way worse ones i won't write here).

i wish the mods took my post down while i was sleeping but it made it to the front page and stayed up for some reason despite reddit telling me i was a fraud. it then got posted to r/quityourbullshit where i got even more hate. i didn't say it was my picture, but i didn't credit the photographer. i seriously fucked up.

i can't even tell you guys how upset all of this made me. living with usher syndrome is not easy. there is no cure and it's terrifying losing both my vision and my hearing. my vision especially. i want nothing more than to try to raise awareness for usher syndrome to discover a cure. not just for myself, but for everyone else who also has to live with this rare disease. 

i was so focused on my mission to raise awareness and share my story, i didn't make the effort to credit the photographer the way i should have. i fucked up reddit. 

i am getting so much hate now, even outside of reddit from people finding me on my blog and other social accounts just to attack me. i'm sad that my post which intended to raise awareness for usher syndrome turned into fuel for such negativity. we have too much negativity in this world and it's got to stop at some point. 

thank you to everyone who was understanding and realized i made a mistake. thank you luke stackpoole for making your beautiful photo free for the public to use. i'm sorry for not taking the time to find you and credit you before. your entire portfolio https://www.withluke.com/ is stunning.

from the bottom of my heart, i am sorry for misleading everyone and not posting correctly on r/pics.

i really did fuck up, though. 


tldr; i tried to raise awareness for usher syndrome by posting a picture on r/pics and failing to credit the photographer, luke stackpoole. my post made it to the front page and reddit now hates me.

edit: a nice redditor (u/omichandralekha) suggested i share the non-profit that donates to usher syndrome research so here you go (no need to click on it if you don't want to, it just takes you to the homepage of this non-profit where you can learn more about it all) - the usher syndrome society: www.ushersyndromesociety.org. also, full disclosure: i am on the board of directors and it's a pretty amazing organization!",4

"update my wife tried to hide my daughter from me. am i wrong to feel this angry?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bty3oi/my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me_am_i/)

hesitant to post an update after how infuriating some of the replies in the previous thread were, but figure i owe it to those of you that offered genuine well meaning advice. plus i've had some time to calm down. i probably wont reply to comments because otherwise i'm just going to get worked up again by people saying my wife didn't betray my trust etc. 

if you're a woman and are going to say it's ""understandable"" what my wife did, then consider how you'd feel if you put a kid up for adoption when you were young, that kid tried to reach out when they turned  18... and your husband told them you wanted nothing to with them without ever telling you they tried to reach out. it's not ""understandable"".

--------------------

wife texted me yesterday and said we ""needed to talk"" while i was at work. this was the first time either of us had spoken or messaged each other since the fight. i dropped our kids off at my parents' house so we could be alone and went straight home. i'm not sure exactly what i was expecting her to say, but i genuinely hoped she would at least apologise first and foremost. because in my opinion she severely betrayed my trust by not only denying my agency, but also lying to me about it, and then downplaying the entire ordeal.

when i get home and we sit down to talk the first thing she says is that she ""forbids"" me from seeing this young woman. not an apology. an ultimatum that if i went and saw her, she would kick me out of the house (which is laughable considering i owned the house before marrying her...)

i asked her if she was serious. if she isn't even going to apologise etc, and she reaffirmed she has nothing to apologise for. yeah, okay. at this point i remembered someone's comment in that post about how she might have done this before. i asked her if she has ever done anything like this previously and she said no. i kept pushing her and she kept saying no. finally i told her that i had already called the fertility clinic to reach out to any parents and explain what my wife had done in case they had tried to contact me previously (not sure what has come of that yet).  i explain that if i find out she has and she doesn't come clean now, i'm divorcing her immediately. she immediately changes tune and says she has ""only"" done it one other time.  ""only"". fuck, that ""only"" infuriated me even though it's just a god damn word.

anyway turns out another girl called a couple years back after she turned 18 too. her parents are lesbians and so she just wanted to meet her biological father since she doesn't have a father of her own (according to my wife, so take it with a grain of salt at this point). i tend to believe what she's saying, as the original girl also has lesbian parents and wanted to meet me for the same reason. she wouldn't say **exactly** what she said to this young women, but she did say she made sure she'd stay away from our family. i mean, at least my wife was finally honest with me, but jesus christ what a fucking heartless thing to do.

i feel like i don't even know my wife. the woman i thought i married had some fucking empathy.

she still hasn't apologised and goes back to ""forbidding"" me from seeing this young woman. i explained she no longer has a say in the matter. had she explained her concerns to me like an adult, i would have listened to them and taken them seriously. but by trying to deny me having any choice in the matter, and for being needlessly cruel to these girls, she doesn't get a say in this anymore.

i told her she has 7 days to give me a genuine apology and agree to marriage counselling, or i would call a divorce lawyer. i also reaffirmed she doesn't get a say in whether i meet with this girl, but i would consider her feelings if any future kids reach out (and she doesn't fucking lie about it).

a few hours later she ""apologised"". i say ""apologised"" in quotes because it was clearly not genuine. but whatever, it's at least an admission of guilt. so we're going to to marriage counselling and try to work through this.

tbh though, i don't think i'll ever see her the same way again. so i have doubts our marriage will last.",8

"most female ""influencers"" are softcore porn models and nothing more.. lets face it: every second woman on instagram pretends like their fanbase cares about what they're eatting this morning.

""hey guys check out the smoothie i'm drinking""

""hey guys swipe up for my code ""daddyissues15"" to get 15% off *insert random item*""

i don't understand how oblivious they are? 90% of their pictures are flirty bikini pictures, some with less than a bikini. each picture tries to show up as much skin as possible without breaking guidlines... but we're supposed to take these people seriously when they winge about their fanbase being filled with creeps???

fair enough, it's not cool when you have guys constantly dming you for more, but let's be honest; this is the image and type of attention you attract.

the people watching you don't care about you and your ""fitness advise"". your progress photos aren't inspiring, they're jerk off material for guys. they just want to see your ass and nothing more.",6
"for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food?. i'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. i've lived there for 6 years. my neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (i actually don't know her first name but i'll call her katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. we exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

so i don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, i don't have as much money for takeout anymore. i'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. i'm gaining weight and i never feel great.

this is where katie comes in. i can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (i know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). i've even complimented it a few times. so i got the idea that i'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or i can pick it up from her!) at night. she's cooking anyway and then i'd have varied presumably delicious food.

i asked her the next time i saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). the next time i saw her a few days later, i asked her if she was sure and upped the amount i was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and i should get a housekeeper if that's what i want. she also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like i was being creepy (i wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). i think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

so, aita?

edit: people keep assuming i'm sexist because i didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. it's not an assumption for me. he and i have lived across from each other for 6 years. the cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and i've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

edit: okay. it is abundantly clear that i was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as i hate to admit it, creepy. my instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, i'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. thanks.",3
"for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes?. first up please know i am trying my best to be kind in my wording. i run a small operation where i guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. i have served all kinds of clients.

i got an inquiry for a group called ""womens+ adventures"" and because it was during pride month, i thought maybe it was an lgbtq+ group. i chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and i started the training plan.

the group wanted to work up to ""a 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. going off what everyone reported, i decided gray's peak. one of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

when i arrived for our first group hike, i learned ""womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than lgbtq+. no issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

the first hike was... awful. it was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. when we got started hiking, it was very slow. one woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. one ate all of her snacks after the first break. lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

after we got back (6 hours later) i pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. she insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that i didn't believe them. when i suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. i gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd hike went even worse. i had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. so i called the head and told her that i thought it was best if i refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that i am fatphobic, i'm mocking them, etc.

please, please keep in mind that i have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. i consider myself to be very patient. one of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

i refunded the money and ended contact only to find my social media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. you can guess what i was called. i felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me i was an asshole for not powering through, that i should have given them three chances, that i should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

"(update):my mil exposed my (28f) past group-assault to my husband (34m). who had no idea. wants him to divorce me. please help me.. tldr: mil told my husband and their family about my assault after stealing my journal where i wrote about it in detail and how it caused my infertility. hubby and i are solid. she then texted everyone pictures of the things written in my journal and said she was doing the christian thing. 

hi guys, i just wanted to give you a quick update about a post i made 5 days ago on here. you were very kind to me. thank you. it got locked and deleted because i had the wrong username so i've just made another account and added the ""throwra"" to my normal username lullabelleanabelle, so i can make a quick update for this subreddit. i'm not sure if i'm allowed to link to my post because i posted it on another subreddit too. a lot of you suggested i go to the mother in law subreddit which was also a big help. thank you everyone. you're wonderful. 

to clear a few things you enquired about and to just speak about my wonderful partner a little more (if i may). i'm not american, european born and raised, but my husband is and we live here. we met at his friend's wedding where i did the bride's makeup (i'm a wedding mua), and he drunkenly told me during the reception that she looked a bit like a chucky doll (she didn't, and he still doesn't know or care what blusher is). we had some serious words, mostly where i told him to stfu, and then he invited me to dinner as a way of apologising for being an ass and i fell hard. and you guys are so right, he is the best person i have ever met. he's a serious, stoic, super focused and quiet kind of guy, doesn't really speak or smile until he needs to but he's so sarcastic and funny and charming and just so sweet and kind. and he says that he really enjoys my giddy chatterbox. so i think i'll need to hold onto him because that type of patience is rare. he's just my world. 

it hasn't been easy. a few things have happened and i can't honestly say that i'm better off for it. but i'm trying.  again, really not a troll post. i'm not creative enough to write something that fantastical. this is all true and a little bit long so im sorry for that. 

i didn't know how to tell him. or what i wanted to tell him. a bunch of you said to show him this page or my diary but those were my private thoughts, i didn't want to show him ever. so, i told him i could show him the details of the court transcripts and my medical records. they aren't particularly easy to read. those men weren't very nice to me. they had found me walking through a park near my house in the evening and grabbed me and pulled me behind one of the paths where a lot of trees and bushes were. and they had gone to jail. 

he got really upset and told me that he didn't care what any of those pieces of paper said, he knew instantly that his mother was lying and just spewing bullshit. that i didn't have to work up the courage to tell him anything about my past if i didn't want to, he'd never thought for a second i was ever hiding anything from him that would ruin our relationship. he'd always known there was something because of the way my anxiety would come out and my nightmares and struggles during intimacy at times, but he would never have pushed the issue. he wanted me to feel safe with him and he trusted me completely. he said he was so scared that i would leave, especially after offering him a divorce. and he was keeping his family away from me because he didn't want them to stress me out any further. they were just confused and concerned and trying to reach out to us. nothing malicious or accusing. 

i thought it was going to all be okay eventually but unfortunately, 3 nights ago, she sent him a text with some pictures of some parts of my journal. she'd taken pictures of the parts where i described things that had happened almost too vividly and then i had pointed out ways i could have defended myself and questioned why i hadn't fought back, before explaining it away as being my fault, blaming it on the way my body had developed and the way i looked and wanting them to do those things to me. its a disgusting, jumbled piece of my mental state at the time. it was stupid but it was just a way back then to pull all my negative thoughts out of my head and get rid of them so i didn't have to think about the ways i could have stopped it. maybe it was the wrong way to do it but it's all i had, i never went to therapy. she put in her message that i had spread my legs and got her son to believe my sob story but she had proof i was a willing whore and she would never let her children and grandchildren be alienated from her. 

his sister rang him crying and told him that their mom had sent her the same text. and to the other siblings and some others in the family. fil was apparently furious and the family have reached out multiple times to my poor husband to apologise and ask after me. 

things haven't been going well. my husband is so broken over his mother's actions and is just lashing out. he's broken all ties with her and is just so furious at anyone in the family who even reaches out to ask if we're doing okay. he won't let them get in contact with me and is just so angry. he owns the house my in-laws live in and financially supports them 100% and has told them that they'll need to get out immediately and he's done financing their shit. but i'm trying to get him to not do that. it's just a house and some money, it doesn't matter. i don't know how to comfort him or what to say or do to reassure him that he is not to blame for what she's done. 

as for me, i'm just in a fog. i don't know how to process what she did, so i'm not going to until i'm ready. my husband isn't leaving me alone and it helps to just cuddle up and pretend nothing has happened for a little bit. i think we might start some couples therapy, just to be able to learn ways to help each other through this and become closer and communicate better. i'm not ready for any therapy regarding my own stuff yet. it sickens me that they know this about me, that they know a chunk of what my feelings and thoughts were back then. i hate it so much that my husband read those parts and he knows i thought like that about myself. i never wanted to be some damaged victim in front of him. its just shit. 

i won't be posting on here again. 
thank you all for your lovely words. i hope you take care.

edit: thank you all so much for being so kind and wonderful. and thank you to the commenters who privately messaged me telling me how much i must have enjoyed and asked for it and offering to reenact it with me again. no.",8
"by deleting reddit's #1 top post of all time. happened just now. sorry for my possible slips as english is not my mothertongue. i mostly only lurk around, but this time i decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

i've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. usually when i get depressed at home i start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because i like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

see, since i'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""accounts"" folder and terminating the ones i don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). the thing is i used to have an imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so i decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since i didn't get it by registering at the service directly. i'll omit the details of all the cyber sex i went through with my keyboard and the browser, but i somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so i pretty much forgot about the whole deal. but little did i know.

later in the day i get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. in addition to that i still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. being the total jackass of an idiot that i am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, i decide to google the #1 top reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on imgur (yeah, the one about the senate, with a total of whole damn 310k updoots). i open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise satan himself. of course imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? it can't be this bugged, right? (i hadn't clicked one by then yet). so i click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this tifu.

i'm sorry. i didn't want to. please, forgive me everyone.

"i f25 received a letter from my mother f49 yesterday in the mail. i've never cried harder.. so around a week ago i posted on reddit that i was having issues with my mother. my husband and i took in my best friends two children after she past from cancer. we are now working on adopting them. she has been totally unsupportive and down right mean to my children, husband and myself. so i decided to take a step back from her.

i've been ignoring her phone calls and today get a letter in the mail addressed about a week ago. it broke my heart and i broke down in tears. probably the most i've cried in so long.

it was such a heartbreaking letter. she said that ""i was a worthless space of a human"" and that ""those kids would be better off in foster care then with me"". it was a full page of just insults. the one that really got to me was ""you've never accomplished anything and you've never made me proud"". i broke down that line. throughout my life all i wanted was to make her proud.

i ended up booking an appointment earlier with my therapist just to let these emotions out. i'm glad that the kids nor my husband were home at that time. i talked to him last night and he just let me cry to him. he truly is my rock.

i truly can't believe my mother would do such a hurtful thing. it broke me down but now i have to pick myself up. i fully think this would be enough for me to cut her out of my life forever. does anyone have any advice? anyone ever cut a parent out forever?",8
"my brother stole almost all of my inheritance and spent it on food and games. what actions should i take against him?. hello. i'm a first-time poster, and i'm also on mobile. i am 19, and i currently live in new york city.

my parents died when my brothers and i were young (eldest was 11, second (the brother in question) was 7, and i was 5). they left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. i turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. it was in march 2019 that i finally got it. it turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. i decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. i wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. i called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after i deposited the money. my savings account has also been taken from. i'll admit, i really should have been paying more attention, but i was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and i got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. we tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. he had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

when i confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. he spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. i know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. it's just line after line of uber eats, postmates, and game purchases. my grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence. it would take years for him to make that money back on minimum wage. should i call the police and have him arrested? is there any way to get that money back?


edit: okay, i've decided to call the police and sue the bank. i know how to get my hands on bank statements, and i'll record him confessing to the theft. but i don't know how to hire a lawyer. where do i start?

edit #2: okay i just figured out how he got ahold of my account details. my grandma sends him to the store with her atm card sometimes to get money. he memorized her card and pin, found the account shared with me, and took from it.

edit #3: thank you so much everyone for all of your concern and advice. i got a ton of messages and i'm trying to answer them all, sorry if it takes long.

i've managed to convince my grandma (after a long arguement about this potentially ruining his life) to sue the bank for negligence and speak to a lawyer. we're going to see if the court would be willing to send him a mental institution instead of jail. haven't gotten him arrested yet, but i told her if need be, i would call them myself.

i like to clarify my grandmother's intentions on protecting him like this. my mother committed suicide right after my father died, and my grandma felt responsible for not helping her or seeing the depression that had taken hold of her. she explained to me that she knew something was mentally wrong with my brother, and was trying to ""make up"" for ignoring my mother's mental state by shielding him. she had no play in stealing my inheritance, other than giving him her card and pin under the assumption that he was just getting money for her since she can't easily walk to the store and use an atm.

edit #4: so i went to the bank. because he went through my grandmother's account, the bank says we have no claim. no case to sue the bank with. there's nothing i can do to get the money back. i'm ruined financially. all i can do is sue him and put him in jail, but i'm never gonna see that money again. i'd like to thank everyone once again for their help, and i'm sorry if i haven't responded to your messages yet. also, thank those two people who gave this post silver and gold. this will be the last edit i make, hopefully.",2

so the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. one of the cues was something like, ""things that are short"" and i write down, ""my boyfriend's penis"". they were all read aloud and when its revealed that i wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. my boyfriend tries to brush it off ""oh you got me! ha ha"" and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him ""oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro!"" more laughter.

after we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. he said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. he said that by making that joke, all i have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. he wasn't mad, just disappointed. he said that he would never make fun of me if i had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me i was beautiful no matter what. 

i felt really, really bad when he said that. i have apologized and things are fine now but i think that maybe he is blowing this out of proportion? am i the asshole or should he maybe not take this so seriously? ",3
"by having, what is hopefully, the strangest sexual experience i encounter. nsfw. literally happened a half hour ago.

husband and i have been together 15 years.  we are both open minded and confident when it comes to sex so there is little we haven't done and we love it all.  nothing is gross or weird with us when we're getting off.

he asked me to help wax his balls a few days ago.  i did.  unfortunately the one section of skin came off with the wax strip.  it was about the size of a quarter but he's tough and didn't complain.

i walk out of the master bathroom to find him jerking off.  he's not home 90% of the year because of work so i, of course, wanted to help him despite staying up late drinking and fucking and therefore worrying the motion of a blow job or getting fucked might make me nauseous which would ruin the mood.  i thought ""i'll lick his perfect balls and help by applying pressure to the base of his dick right under his balls"".  

he's loving it.  i'm loving licking and sucking and cradling his balls, independently and simultaneously, in my mouth.

i feel something as i'm making circles with my tongue.  no big deal whether it's hair or lint whatever so i quickly pull my finger and thumb up to retrieve the foreign, unknown object.  as i pluck it off my tongue (trying not to miss a beat of our quality time) i glance at it.  it's grey and slimy, bunched up and longer than my longest fingernail.  it took a half a second to realize that i had literally sucked the scab off my husband's balls.  

tl;dr - exfoliated husband's balls with my mouth.",4

"tsa detained, roughly handled my terminally ill father and his port, causing us to go to the er and possibly miss out on experimental treatment.. i'm going to try to state this as calmly as possibly.

my father has cancer, walks with a cane/wheelchair, and has a port(https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/cdr756805-750.jpg) for his treatments that is a tube from the side of his chest going to his heart.  we came to this country 20 years ago, both my parents speak english well with an accent that is not so thick people have difficulty understanding them in our city (new york) facing the customer directly at our shop. they sometimes get syntaxes, plurals, and slang wrong, but it's not hard to figure out, my father read the times daily and has given lectures at a college. i'll gladly post an audio clip of them speaking if needed. however, the cancer and medication make him very soft spoken, and his hearing isn't that great (he's nearly 70) and when very upset or flustered, can have a hard time finding the right words. 
 

today, they were flying from tn (i don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to houston, tx, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   he had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (brooklyn, ny) and in texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which i will request from his doctors tomorrow)  he also brings a printout from the tsa about traveling with a port and cancer which i will find the exact link to when i get more info.  

my parents arrive 3:45 to a tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
both parents have tsa pre and get on line at about 4. they are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  the agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the id, etc.  my father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. meanwhile i assume he is not speaking his best english, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. i'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which i think adds to the confusion. they wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. they don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  they go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   my father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  he calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  he tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (his first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) they take him into a small room away from my mother. he is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  the agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. the agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  my father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed his parents and most of his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  i have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. he couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

he tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115-25 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) the agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   the agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. my father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  they bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  they wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  they agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  they take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. he asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. by this point the plane has left.  they go to the er to see if port is damaged and for pain medication.

he has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  my father is in incredible, needless pain, in a strange city hospital.  port is ok but they want to check him out again before flying.

i would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. if he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? they have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. i am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so i have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that i can go over with her later, so i'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
my family is very quiet, i don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  i would if that is the only option, however.  i don't know if it's relevant that we are muslim, either, i assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  my father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  he doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  i would love some advice.  apologies for length.
edit- i do not know if this is correct flair, if you want me to change it please advise.",2
"by letting my girlfriends dad use my laptop nsfw. so today i had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, i'm still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn't make one hell of a story for you all

okay so for a bit of back story i'm 27 and i live with my girlfriend, we've been together for 2 years now and through out that time i've seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they're usually travelling so it's a little harder to spend time with them. now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and i for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. we've also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....

so on top of making porn i'm also an aspiring film editor and i am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but i also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us i'd been editing a new video, usually after editing i go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because i'd always got the vibe they didn't like me very much. we were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, i immediately said sure and led him into the office, now i could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and i kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. so i lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as i opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst i ejaculated on her face, if that's not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

i panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn't want her dad getting us sick also.

her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and i are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but i hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and i'll keep you updated if anything else happens 



tl;dr i unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won't talk to us

update: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so i'll explain, as i said earlier in the post i watch the video post editing to make sure there's no problems before uploading, before going to sleep i just shut the laptop without even thinking, i do this often (i know it's not good but sshh) if you don't stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. still haven't heard from her dad yet. i honestly didn't expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and i laugh a lot so thank you

update 2: thank you all for participating in a social experiment stay tuned",4
what are some things that sound like compliments but are actually insults?. ,1
"by agreeing to an ""open relationship"". obviously a throwaway. 

to put things into perspective, i (m 20) and my gf (f 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

we decide to spice things up a bit and ""open"" up our relationship a little. it was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole ""sex is fun"" idea.

she is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she's met a guy (m 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn't working at the time. i agreed. i tell her to go for it, and she does. she texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

the week after, she mentions she's meeting up with this guy again. wasn't expecting it but i'm cool with it. again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. a decision i would live to regret. she doesn't text me the entire night. weird, but okay maybe she's just having a good time?

the next day i receive a load of messages about how she needs a ""break"" from ""everything"" right now. meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. a little more conversation and we're over. she's completely cut me out of her life. i check her snap chat story, and of course, she's with him. i've heard from her friends that they're dating now. 

tldr; agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me.",4
"when buying a car at a dealership and they leave you alone to talk about it, check their desk phone speaker light. if it is on, they are most definitely listening to your conversation from the back office..  

it happened to us when i bought my first used car at a vw dealership. we were discussing the sale price and he left us to ""talk about it"" while he went to ""run some numbers"" by the finance manager. i had given an offer of $1000 below their asking price as that is what i could afford. my mother said she could chip in $500 more if that would help me out. 

he came back and said his ""boss"" could meet in the middle, $500 off sale price.  we were quite happy about it all and it was done.

later on i got an office job with the exact same phones the dealership had. found out the green light button was lit when the phone was active, and the microphone on.",9
"by taking lsd and pretending to be french for 10 months. throwaway for reasons.
tl;dr at the bottom.

so this was more of a fu that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

about 11 months ago i moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until i could get the money together to sort something out properly, i was hoping to have already moved out by this point. on my second day after i'd finished unpacking i decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, i'd brought some with me that i'd recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and i quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than i had been told they were, and i thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn't helping me relax. so i figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because i was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

so i left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. it's a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door's door is about one meter away from mine. i'd not met anybody on my street yet and didn't realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. she said something along the lines of ""hello nice to meet you, my name's (her name), are you new to the area?""

so basically i do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where i pretend i can't speak english. i remember a few words from my gcse french so i just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. in the state i was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and french just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. my exact words were ""je voudrais une boulangerie"" (one of my favourite lines to use) and i shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. she pretty much just left me to it after that and i got on my way. i did my walk and got home about two hours later, i was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. when i got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. i tried to keep my head down because i couldn't handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said ""bonjour"", so i instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. when i got in i started freaking out straight away because i realised that i'd just become french and now two of the neighbours think i can't speak any english. the next day when i woke up i realised the best thing i could do (as an englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be french for seemingly no reason. 

fast forward 10 months, i still live here, and at this point i'm in deep. my life on this street is a web of lies. i've perfected my french accent and over the course of 10 months french me has learnt a decent amount of english so he can hold disjointed conversation.
i'd gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and i was the nice quirky french guy on the street. i didn't let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation i had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered i wasn't french. if i had friends come over (i don't have many so it wasn't too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. most of them found it amusing, at least. 

things were going okay and i wasn't too worried about being exposed anymore because i'd gotten so used to it. i'm not home that much and when i am i rarely leave the house for any reason so i only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when i was out on my street. if anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when i got to take on my french persona. french me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his english was a bit limited.

but then there was the day it all came crashing down. i was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her i didn't recognise. she stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend ""this is f7tj78, the guy i was telling you about"". you might be able to see where this is going. 

her friend hits me with a question in french that i didn't understand a word of, and i knew he was actually french straight away because his accent was way better than mine. i didn't know what to do and i just froze. every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause i just decided i had to come clean. i told her i wasn't actually french and couldn't speak french and then i tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke i'd been doing on everyone. nobody was buying that. i fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

i haven't spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which i'd  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. i make sure nobody is around now whenever i leave the house, and i do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when i get home so that i never come into contact with them. every time i think about the day i was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

tl;dr: pretended to be french to avoid human interaction on lsd, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a french man.

edit: i didn't think this post was going to catch much attention, and i'm praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. some people seem to have a hard time believing that i thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, i'd like to remind people that when i made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",4

"by plagiarizing from my own reddit post and getting threatened to be dropped from my university. ***background***

i am a very passionate writer. i *had* an account that was just for writing prompts. every week i would go to that sub and write long detailed stories.  

***story time***

last year, on r/writingprompts, someone gave a prompt idea that revolved around a student who one day became rich. i forget the full details, but it intrigued me and i wrote a 6-page story about it. anyways, that post didn't gain any traction (which sucked), but i still had a 6-page short story just sitting on that reddit post.

**^((it was on a different account, which is no longer alive))**

***present*** 

so a few weeks ago, my writing class professor gave the class an assignment that was literally about the same idea. so i was like, okay sweet i don't need to spend any time on this project. i went over to that account, copied the text, put it into a word document and submitted. to be sure i don't get into any trouble, i delete the account, forgetting that it wouldn't delete all my comments. 

yesterday, i get an email from the professor saying i need to meet with the dean immediately. at this point, i am shitting my pants. she told me that i stole someone else's work and i could be withdrawn from my program. i try to explain but i have no proof that it was my work because i no longer live at home and i wrote it on an old laptop. i have a meeting with the head of the university later today. i am so fucking scared. i am currently driving home to find that fucker.

tl;dr: i copied and pasted my own work from my own reddit post, which caused my assignment to show up as plagiarized. could be withdrawn from my program


edit 1: 17:00 i found my original work. took me an hour of going through files on a slow laptop. travelling back now, meeting is in 3 hours. i'm okay with taking a zero, obviously, i just hope they can reason. 

also, i can't show the reddit emails because i never had a real email for the account. 

edit 2: success! i brought my old laptop to the university principal and provided proof that i was the one to write the story. they were skeptical, but the dates matched up with what i told them before. they asked me why i did this and asked me to tell them why it was not okay to do this. i told them it was a lack of understanding and apologized. 

*results*

i am not kicked out, and i am actually given another chance at the project. my professor told me he actually enjoyed the story lol. 


thanks everyone who supported me through this! i won't do this again. i'm sorry. 


also, thanks u/squid_fucker for the suggestion

> just read all the edits.  you know what you should do, is incorporate all this into the story.  if the idea is about a student getting rich all of a sudden, write a story about a student who plagiarizes a story for a writing assignment and it takes off and gets published and he becomes insanely wealthy off of it but the guilt over who the original author drives him mad.

"we need to let some pet breeds die out.. we have destroyed what were once great creatures by selective breeding, and we need to let some of our ""creations"" die out.

breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

of course i don't mean all breeds of animals when i say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds i do mean:

french bulldogs, pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: these dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

munchkin cats: munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. if they had no health risks, i still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. but, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (hollowed chest), and lordosis (curved spine).

this isn't even hard to achieve. simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

but i doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

edit: i posted this very early in the morning, i know i wrote ""car"", but i did not mean that! i think i meant cat.

thanks for commenting, i have read lots of them (over 300, only got hundreds left!), and there are lots of informative comments about other breeds of cats and dogs, and different animals such as snakes! this has been very informative, thank you for commenting, liking, giving awards, etc!",6

got one last year, was surprised at how cheap and effective it is.

our house is relatively new yet the downstairs gets frigid, my wife mentioned that the windows felt drafty yet they were solidly shut. we used this and found very slight cracks in the chaulking that were letting cold air in. after using it to find all the weak spots and rechaulking along with fixing some door insulation and closing a flue the house is much more comfortable.

bonus: you can aim it at pans/foods and tell temps within a few degrees (surface only of course).

double bonus: aim it at your so and say you found something hot.

you can get them on amazon shipped right to you and the batteries last forever, enjoy!

no this isn't a 100% perfect item, it's cheap and does a few things and is neat. don't eat raw/undercooked meat. people are weird, including myself.

"update i feel like my white boyfriend is mainly with me for the novelty of being with a ""pretty black girl"" and clout.. we didn't get the chance to see each other all week, but we managed to link on saturday. i wanted to speak about things in person.

i didn't want to go in all accusatory so i just started to say how i feel (it's a good idea who knew lmao). i talked to him about how hearing his friend stereotype black people, and my boyfriend laughing and agreeing with him made me feel.

how ""cool black kids"" were a prop for them at their partners. just a source of entertainment and that upset me. they let them in with the expectation that they'll dance and turn up in a way that'll make the party cooler. there is always a moment at these parties always have the black people dancing in a small small circle doing their thing and everyone else surrounds and sc them. it's like a show. i thought it was a coincidence until i knew it was kinda...orchestrated? black guy walks in and they throw them the aux. not to mention there were no black guys in the frat or in any of their inner social circles, but they love to have them around to dance for them. i told him that i didn't even want to get into letting ""hot black girls in"" hoping they'll twerk. but i talked about how it felt like that's how he saw me. he listened to me the entire time without jumping in and i've never had someone do that before so i appreciated it.

he spoke and said that because of where he grew up, he was used to tolerating fuckshit. that's just how people talked around him and way worse behind closed doors. but never spoke up or anything and he thought that was cool as long as he wasn't saying it. he sees things differently than i do sometimes, but being with me, he's trying to do better. also that, choosing who gets into a party and who to hook up with is purely superficial. but you can't be with someone for almost a year just because they have a pretty face. then we talked about why we were with each other and i won't get into it, but it was really sweet and emotional.

then we started talking about the ""drip or drown"" for guys and **""if she's not a nine, she stays outside""** for girls.

we both agreed it was an awful way to talk about people. he was frats parties are superficial, and so are clubs and they let people in the same way. but the more people want to get in, the higher the standards get. at the end of the day, they can let in whoever in they want. it's their home and they don't have to make it available for everybody if they want to.

his dad was in a frat (his cousins too) and his sister was a sister. it offers a life-long brotherhood, networking and advantages for the field he's pursuing. plus, they're just fun to be in.

so everything worked out and we're just taking things day by day.

also people got so mad because i called myself pretty. women are told to accept compliments all the time, but i do it...it makes me conceited? i'm hella pretty and i know it. stay mad.

but to everyone else, thank you so much for the support and advice.

**edit: guys i read the comments and i'm more confused...i really thought that we had a mature conversation and he promised to better, to call out his friends and tolerate it anymore. he listened to me and i thought all i could do is wait until i see if he follows up. he seemed genuine and i do give him the benefit of the doubt. but maybe i shouldn't...idk here.**

**i've never dated outside my race and i have mostly black friends, so i've never been in this position before. i came here to get different opinions and i did. i guess what i'll do now is watch closely. i really didn't see things this way and thanks for the input and guidance.**",8

"update: i 31m found out my fiance cheated during her 30f bachelorette party, planning on leaving. i will be posting the update here instead since i am still receiving pms to update what happened. i am not allowed to post in relationships (mods told me i am not allowed to post an update thread there) so i got the advice from someone to post the update here instead. this is the post i posted about 2 hours ago on relationship. will try my best to update it as time goes.

here is my previous post for the people who did not read:

click here to see my previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wod49/i_31m_found_out_my_fiance_cheated_during_her_30f/)

i will try to be as detailed as possible. i have had quite a few pm's regarding what happened and i got such a big amount of responses (both positive and negative) which i never imagined would have happened. i want to let you all know that the support i have received has been incredible (both in pm and on the post itself) which has helped me in taking my decision.

i am also sorry for not being able to respond to all the pm's, theres just too many to respond to but i would like to throw out much love for all of you who took the time.

i would also like to give a big thanks on my post to everyone who replied, i tried to respond but i noticed the thread was closed (i still dont know why mods close it) but i still want to give a big thanks to the people who took the time to give me advice. much love to you all.

i basically left in the morning to take a smoke, my head was still messed up but reading all the comments on reddit helped me. i cant remember who, but there was one guy who said the positive thing about all of this is that i found out before i got married, with no children or attachments. i still dont think she cheated other than this night, nothing i found indicated anything else, i guess she wanted this to be her ""last night"" before settling down or soemthing, i honestly dont know and dont care.

when i was outside taking a smoke, about 15-20 minutes or something after i left reddit, she had woken up. she noticed the drinks out and asked me what i had been up to, basically came to give me a kiss and a hug. i followed through with it but honestly felt empty doing it, i didnt want to give her any hint of what i knew. she asked my why i had been drinking and why i didnt come to sleep last night and i told her i was just having some nightmares but everything was fine. i felt detached, like i was watching myself in third person through a tv or something.

she asked me if any stress was related to the marriage and the plans, i just told her something along the lines of ""you know i love you, there is no stress i have for the marriage, how can you be stressed about the best thing in your life"". she got herself done and left for work.

i basically started packing my most important things, my desktop, computer, most clothes and some other things. i planned on leaving things like furniture, tv and other things i really dont care about more than getting the fuck out. i just took the stuff most important to me so that i dont have to return here again. i dont care if she gets the rest. all in all my stuff added up to about 3 or 4 suitcases i would say (desktop not included in this).

i called and cancelled the venue we were supposed to be having the wedding at, apparently they take 15 &#37; of the money for cancelling so early on because we were having such a big event, i told them its fine and i really dont care at this point.

i also saved screenshots of everything and have taken them with me.

around 1 pm i called a taxi and went to stay at a hotel around 100 km far from my city. i didnt leave any note or pictures at home, i just left. i am planning on leaving to stay with a really really close friend who lives in a town about 300 km away, but i just needed the alone time in the hotel for some time to think everything through and process whats happened.

around 3:30 pm my phone starts getting spammed with calls from my ex-fiance. around 3:50 i start getting calls and messages from her sister, her friends, her parents, my parents and a few of our mutual friends.

the only person i called back was my dad and mom. i have a huge trust for my parents, i basically spilled the beans and told them a nicer story about what happened, asked my dad to not say anything and also asked my mother not to say anything. i told them its ended, and that i wont be getting married no more. i also told them not to tell anything to anyone about what i told them, i trust them alot so i am sure they wont say anything. i didnt tell them exactly what happened, just that i found out she wasnt being loyal to me, i didnt think giving details would help in anyway.

around 5 pm my dad calls mee back and is telling me my ex-fiance is completely hysterical and has basically broken down completely not understanding what is going on. i just told my dad not to intervene and that i need some alone time now.

i basically just shut my phone down and have been staying silent ever since, like a ghost. been sleeping for a little, went to the pool here at the hotel and have just been taking it easy.

i dont know if i should respond to them now or wait some more? her sister knew about what happened at the bachelorette party ( i have the texts to prove it, she even laughed about it and told her not to feel guilty, because its her bachelorette and that women should go all in on this night). i am seriously considering replying with to the sister, with just an image of the conversation where she is telling her this.

once again, thank you to everyone who replied. i will update this post 1 or 2 more times and then perhaps go silent for a while, i know you are only aloud to do 1 update on relationships section. i hope this post wont get closed (still dont know why the last one did).

time here is 10 pm soon.

tl;dr found out my fiance cheated and i left without saying anything. not 100&#37; sure what to say or to at this point...

edit 1:  since i still gett messages asking what happened i will leave this edit here. yes i did send the with proof to her sister (the part where the sister is talking about it) to her sister. i have since not received any call or message from the sister. my phone is still blowing up with calls and messages from the ex-fiance. havent read them though, yet. thinking of answering or something but i dont know what to say or do. might make another post later today so i can update you with what happened.

edit 2: thanks once more for all support, sorry i havent updated, alot of things have happened and im too exhausted to write it all out today. i will head to sleep and try to update tomorrow morning with a new post. once again thanks for all support and all comments and feedback, i never believed i could have a community help me in such a big way. i might go for a vacation or something, dont know yet... i will just shortly explain that i really feel like neo in the matrix dodging bullets in slomo, however instead of dodging bullets i have dodged a slut wife, unwanted children with this wife, endless of fights and ton of depression. i honestly feel alot better knowing my life will get better. 
shortly said about her, she has broken down and is begging me to take her back, so is her sister and friends. they also come up with the most retarded excuse of what actually happened (i dont believe them for 2 seconds) and much more... will let you all know tomorrow, going to crash now im mentally exhausted.",8

&#x200b;

i said i'd come back if anything relevant happened!

&#x200b;

ex-bf kept trying to get in touch through common friends. they kept asking me to unblock him and at least hear him out, cause he was really sorry, he loved me, he was a mess, he didn't mean to, someone even went as far as to ask me if i was really sure it happened. they offered to send me prints of texts where he was talking about me, so i'd see how he always had great things to say and how much he cared. but i've had it with the print screen drama for life, and said no. to the ones who insisted i told them i wasn't unblocking him, had nothing to say or hear, and if they kept pushing me, i'd block them too.

i ran into ex bf at this book thing i go to often (hobby of mine). maybe i'm being presumptuous, but i think he went there for me. he didn't really have any business there, but i'm just speculating really. he asked if i had a few minutes for coffee, i said i was late (lie). he walked me to my car. he looked so good, smelled great. he was so sweet. was even wearing his hair the way i like it. i fell horrible cause even after everything, i still like him. he apologized some more, said he knew i needed time and space but asked if i'd consider giving him another chance cause he would wait for me. said he would never talk to jessie again, and would act like they had restraining orders against each other. and i just found it really funny how everything he was saying required me trusting him. which i don't. so i told him i wasn't interested anymore and he should move on. i wish i said something snappier or wittier. but i had nothing.

this was saturday, i haven't heard from him or friends since. i think that was that. 

&#x200b;

jessie also kept trying to talk to me. like i told some of you on comments, i had a trip coming up, it would have been me, jessie, ex bf, and a few friends. since jessie couldn't afford it, my parents payed for most of her expenses. she must have remembered this right after everything went down and panicked cause i had everything (vouchers, confirmations emails, credit card info...). she went crazy. even showed up at my place (i wasn't home and my roommate told her to fuck off, exact words). i didn't block her at first cause i admit i was having some fun watching her despair.

i talked to my mom and she was amazing. told me i should cancel everything even if it costed us money, it was fine. so i did. and for one last bit of print screen drama: i printed all the emails i got confirming cancellations and sent those to jessie with the word ""bye"" before blocking her.

&#x200b;

my roommate has been amazing. we were never really close and now i don't even know why. she cancelled plans with her friends to stay with me and invited me to go out with them next weekend.

&#x200b;

a few of you suggested i see a therapist and i did, yesterday. i really liked it. it was just one appointment and i mostly just talked, but it felt good. she gave me ""homework"": she talked a little about unhealthy and abusive relationships and asked me to think about my friendship with jessie and try to point what was healthy and what was unhealthy about it. made me realize she was never really my friend. she was taking advantage of me for years and she even had me thanking her for it. therapist also told me about this saying (i think that's what it is) called ""the narcissist's prayer"", which goes something like ""that didn't happen. if it did, it wasn't my fault. if it was, i didn't mean it. and if i did, then you deserved it"", which is totally how jessie is handling this whole thing now.

so good riddance indeed

&#x200b;

and a final piece of gossip. ""pete"" talked to me yesterday (he is checking up sometimes, he's a good guy. again, he is gay, in case someone is still thinking this might turn into a romantic comedy) he said jessie was super sure that since i broke things off, she and dean would hook up right away. but apparently he doesn't have the same plans and that freaked her out over the weekend. pete says he really is a mess and went out drinking hard 4 nights in a row to the point he had to be carried home by his pals. and yesterday, they all went out for lunch at this burger place, jessie was going to run her fingers through his hair or something and he just pushed her away and told her to stop and to never touch him again. (great that **now** he manages to do that, huh?)

i guess in the end he really did like me in his sick way. the thing is, i don't want to be with someone who likes me in a sick way. i want to be with someone who likes me in a healthy way. i thin i deserve that.

&#x200b;

i am also thinking about taking the money i got back from the trip to go somewhere else by myself. haven't decided though.

&#x200b;

anyway, this will be the final update on this, since it is unlikely that i will have anything new to add

now, i think i just need time to heal and let go, you know?

i might come back in a few months if there is reason to do a ""yay life is awesome now"" post, but i wanted to post this update now cause i wanted to end this whole story on a bright note. and, of course, thank you all again!! you are the best!!

"'happy' is one of the most annoying songs ever written.. it does not make me happy and i don't want to clap along. it's honestly one of the worst songs on earth. i'm sorry to anyone that likes it but i just can't stand it. it makes me feel really angry when i hear it. that and 'roar' by katy perry, which has been played more times on every single radio station than every other song combined it feels. both of them make me want to rip my own face off.

"""money can't buy happiness"" is the biggest bullshit statement of the past hundred years.. for almost every normal person in the world, money can buy happiness. the only case where this doesn't exist is with people that are severely depressed to the point that nothing matters anymore. for almost everyone else, a new car, house, medical care, medication, etc is what they need to be happy.

"mi, usa considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now i have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear. i have a big family, with around 20 cousins,  10 aunts and uncles, and several others who always show up to family  reunions. i'm a male in my 20s.

last weekend we had a family reunion in a cabin resort in the woods. on the last night there, while everyone was sitting by the campfire, my uncle (by marriage), snuck up behind me and blasted an air horn about a foot  or two away from the back of my head. this air horn was not a normal little one you often see at sporting events. this campground has bear  around, so they keep several large air horns around the place to be used to scare off a bear in case they get too close.

as soon as he did it, everyone called him an asshole and got angry at him. he showed no remorse whatsoever. he laughed about it, telling us how he and his friends from work have blown air horns at each other before as a prank.

i was so furious when it happened that i didn't know what to do. i sat there quietly stewing in my rage for a while. i wanted to beat the shit out of him or hold him down while i emptied half of the air horn directly into his ear. but instead i  walked away eventually and spent the rest of the night in my room. it's important to know that this uncle was hosting this reunion. it's a ""corporate retreat campground"" that his company lets employees use.

he clearly knew he fucked up because he attempted to apologize the next day, but it was a pretty shitty apology. while everyone was sitting down for breakfast, he snuck up behind me, put his arms on my shoulders and quietly said, ""i heard your ears were ringing. sorry about that."" he didn't even say it to my face, or say it loud enough for anyone else to hear. i grumbled something about ""it's okay,"" but i absolutely do not forgive him.

this happened last saturday, a week ago. for the first couple days my ears were literally sore, and any loud noises were painful to hear. since then, my ears have been constantly ringing. it's the worst when i'm in a quiet environment, like  trying to work or go to sleep. i hear this high pitched sound that is driving me nuts. sometimes it'll start to subside, but it still comes and goes. i think i could have permanent hearing damage.

this  guy has been giving me shit since i was a young kid, so this was not a one time occurrence, though this was definitely the worst thing he's done to me by far. i've contacted a personal injury lawyer in my area to learn about my options, but i figured some people here might have good info as well. i won't hear back from the lawyer until tomorrow at the earliest. any info is appreciated. suing my uncle would tear a huge hole in my family, but i really don't care about that if i end up having a ringing in my ear for the rest of my life. it's interfering with my ability to sleep and work. thanks for any help.

"yesterday, my(33m) wife's (34f) best friend (female) contacted me and told me that her husband and my wife were having an affair and my 3yo daughter is actually his daughter.. wife and i have been together since high school. married for 10 years. i'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. 

my wife's best friend megan and i work for the same company( different departments ). so yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. so i met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. i tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. 

according to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. she confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. 

and when i confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when i told her that megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. 

i really don't know what to do. i mean, everything was a lie right? my little girl taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. what do i live for now? i just don't know what to do. just here for some advice. i'm sorry if this felt like a rant.",8
"for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it?. i fucking hate wedding culture.

it's bullshit.

my fiance and i thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. we were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

then the demands started coming out. they wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person has to be a groomsman, etc etc. suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

we put our foot down and said:

>thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. when we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. with so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   
>  
>our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  
>  
>if you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. but if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.

this has caused an epic shitstorm. such to the point where i have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. my parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. 

we are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want.

"meta: this sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world. i've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and i feel like i've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. over time, more and more of the posts seem to have a- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and b- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

given that, i think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

so just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

they'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. they'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

the internet has its own values, and that's fine. but in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? people who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? people who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? the people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

so yeah. i love this sub, i love reading the stories and i find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. but i personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people i know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. i don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

so even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. and maybe this is just me, but i really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. that's a discussion worth having too.

edit: thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. and lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

edit 2: wow, this got very big. it's gonna take me a minute to read all this. 

and alright guys, maybe the one about not ever wanting to socialize with coworkers outside of work is more of a thing in my field, not a universal experience. academia blurs the line between personal and professional like nobody's business, so i might have a warped view on this one.

"update: hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. building management's negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (to, canada). link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

first i want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and i are quite happy with. i've been very active on reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. it has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. i digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

through the advice i received on this subreddit, i contacted the city and the health department right away. i was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. the more we spoke the more interested he became. he called and asked me ""if i were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would i be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?"" to which i replied ""150%"". he then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, i said ""no."" 

shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. i went out and asked them why. they told me they were instructed to because they don't want people panicking etc. i told them they were to leave it there as i have called the city and they are on their way. they didn't seem happy. as if the whole floor isn't already in a panic anyway. literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. i also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. i have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. this lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

i explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. according to toronto health and bylaws that is bullshit. the situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. the bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information i have been receiving from the building management. 

the bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. i heard nothing until monday. come monday morning i get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. they will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. the cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. i'm guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

the city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. i do not believe them at all. we have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they ""didn't know"" and will be handing it over. from what i understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. i have the personal contact information for the officer i spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. we went from ""submit a maintenance request"" to ""we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately"" in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

thank you so much reddit!!! i couldn't have done it without your help!! 

here is hoping the next few months continues on a more upward trajectory. ",2
"for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?. so my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. she was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. she was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn't lift a finger to go visit her. 

i tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. he said no. and my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. i spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he'd have to fly over to her country too. which is fair enough. 

he said no, he didn't want to fly or travel anywhere. my son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

last week, he told us she's dumped him. i went on her fb page as we're all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she's upset it didn't work out but these things happen, so we're on good terms) and looks like she's with a new guy already. me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

i confessed to them both that i actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. he did not treat her properly and i hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. i said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

wife and son are very upset that i said this. very very upset and my wife says i am being horrible.

"update my (21m) friend (21f) is being forced to marry a 43 year-old man.. **previous post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ceqcnx/my\_21m\_friend\_21f\_is\_being\_forced\_to\_marry\_a\_43/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ceqcnx/my_21m_friend_21f_is_being_forced_to_marry_a_43/)

first of all i want to thank everyone for reading my previous post and giving me good advice. your comments gave me further insight in this situation. i apologize for not giving you guys frequent updates to this situation as i was busy with work.

so after my last post i talked with my friends and my college professors about this mess. fortunately almost all of them were ready to help. later during that day we all decided to talk to my friend (21f). we explained to her about the severity of the situation as she was not ready to run away from her house and if she does not act fast she might end up getting married to the old thug ( i know though she might have been frozen in fear, as this is a important decision in her life and she had not made any such decisions before. she is of the type that always follows the crowd and obeys what the others say. ). after lot of convincing from me other friends and professors she finally decided to act. but she was still hesitant to run away as she might bring a lot of suffering to her little sister(14f) who would still be with her parents. so we had to act keeping her little sister in mind. so we convinced her to take her sister with her. we also involved her sister in our plan.

now the main problem was where they would stay and who will help her get along. which was managed by our professor *( dr m. i will not give his full name here. but dr sir i know you browse this sub so if you are reading this, i thank you million times. ).* apparently our professor has a extended family thousands of kilometers from where we live, who are happy to let her and her sister stay rent free for sometime.

so on 25 july at 4am in morning we planned her and her sister escape. we made sure she took her important stuff and documents of her and her sister with her. after we had breakfast at one of my friends place. we all left for the train. we made sure she destroys her old sim card. skip to the day 27 july we arrived at the place and i helped her unpack. bought some clothes for her and her sister and overall they seem to get adjusted pretty quickly. we still need to take admission to school for her sister (fortunately there are free schools for girls in india). and she recently landed a good job. so financially she is settled, but i will still be helping her however she needs.

meanwhile recently we had filed police complaint about her parents and that man. we also informed women's welfare center about this. things seem normal and i will keep you guys updated as things progress.

"i (21f) found a hidden camera in my house. i suspect my sil (26f) put it there to watch me while i babysit my nephew (1m). what do i do?. i babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm mon-fri for free because a) i love my brother and nephew and b) i'm already a sahm for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, i have everything he needs already at home and i love kids. 

the spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. there is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv i found a weird circular object with a lens in it. after some googling i found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. i flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. he vehemently denied it and suggested i called the police and explain to them that i need a bug check. the only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my sil; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and bro and our parents only come on the weekends. i suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. another reason i suspect sil is because i had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" it could be a coincidence, but now that i found the camera i'm not so sure.


if it's her, she knows i know since i'm assuming she saw me find it. what do i do? do i confront her and ask if its hers? i couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; i have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. i would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care i take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course i treat my nephew the same.",8

"for not paying for the extra meal i accidentally ordered at a wedding?. my sixteen year old son and i went to a wedding. when we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. there was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but i never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. i sent in the rsvp card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

at the wedding, my son and i got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. the waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. the waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

i later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that i had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. i told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. they said i should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that i should have asked for clarification if i wasn't sure. but i wasn't unsure, i never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. ten and under i would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up i would never think would have a kid's meal. the bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but i've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. i think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. 

if i refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? i know wedding meals are expensive, but i think this was their mistake.",3

"for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?. my 19-year old daughter vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they've never don't ever see each other besides a few quick weekend visits. moreover, they've only dated for a little more than a year. 

i told her i was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. but i maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

the problem lies when vanessa asked me for money. you see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, i decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn't have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). that combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn't have to work at all during the school year. 

since i gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. i told vanessa that i was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

she now says that she's moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in it). she said that now she's not going to school, she'd rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

i told her i cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. if/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she's married, i'll be happy to contribute the money. but it's not just a free handout.

she's got really mad that i rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. to her credit, her brother and i have a closer relationship (he's always been the studious rule-follower while vanessa was more the troublemaker), but i do love my children equally. i told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiance, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. that if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, i will fully support it financially.

well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. my wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but i told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and i rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and when she has to move back home. i don't want her to think i support this decision.

she told me she sorta saw my point, but she's not going to help me unravel this mess with my vanessa, she's staying out of it. i, on the other hand, think she's acting like a spoiled brat. for sticking to my guns on this?",3
"donating organs after death should be the standard, not even mandatory literally normal procedure. just like refusing to call an ambulance when someone is in need is a crime, refusing to give organs because your family members want your body to keep them should be a crime as well

so, this morning ended up being a meeting with my boss. now, yesterday i was given a run down of how she made a complaint of interrupting her work day and not being told important information. she did have an 'example' but it was very stupid one.


co-worker when she was at my desk had apparently been staring at my screen. she saw that the usual application to log data we use wasn't up and went straight to assuming i wasn't working. what she didn't know is me and two other senior employees were using a new application that we will be switching over to and was running on that application (with the old one minimized) she then came back to ask about lunch and saw 'i still didn't have the application up' and went running to boss to tell him i wasn't on the application and i wasn't working, making it hard for her as she had to pick up the slack. 


my boss calmly assured her that i was working on a different application and all productivity is monitored (i get my shit done) she then, not wanting to be wrong i guess, doubled down and was upset i hadn't communicated that to her. i didn't even know. my boss asked her to elaborate on that and she brought up the application again and i guess they talked in circles for a bit. he let her know that he takes these matters seriously and asked her for any examples of me not communicating. she had nothing. 


when i spoke to my boss, at this point i was upset. i finally just told him what happened and explained what happened yesterday. he was not pleased. he did let me know i don't have to explain myself and that next time if i'm in that situation to go straight to him. he offered his condolences for my loss.


as for her, she is no longer allowed to speak to me. anything work related must be done through the messenger we have or email. though, he assured me that as we are working on different applications, she shouldn't be reaching out to me. she has a laundry list of people to ask before me. he told me to document everything. anything she does say document it for the time being and be as curt as possible.


today, she hasn't been around me. she even moved her monitor and keyboard so she's facing away from me. she hasn't said a word all day. it's been a wave of relief for me.


tldr: coworker tried to report me for something stupid, it didn't work. she is now not allowed to speak to me.

"vanilla coke is the best flavor, even better than the regular flavor of coke.. to begin, what the hell even is the flavor of regular coke? sugar? it's indiscernible and, frankly, a little bland. all you really get with the base flavor is fizz. 

with the vanilla flavor, however, the whole soda gets creamier, smoother, with a flavor you can notice and a sweet after-taste reminiscent of buttercream frosting. the whole drink gets less harsh to swallow, not to mention that vanilla and whatever the base flavor is *work*. like, really well.

in fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange coke (which just taste like regular coke with fruits shoved in them).  

the only real downfall to vanilla coke is that it's not wide-spread; only two stores in my town sell it, which is a huge shame considering how much of a blessing vanilla coke is.

"by trying to edit a headshot without permission, hr is involved.. tl;dr at bottom.

i work in a corporate environment in the marketing department. a portion of what i do is handling the corporate website. one of our mid-level professionals (i'll call her gina) has recently published an excellent research paper that is topical, relevant and insightful. it's a pretty big deal for her professionally, and the company as a whole.

every year, we get professional headshots done to feature in corporate documents. it's one guy who does every office, and he's usually pretty good, but with 800 staff and unrealistic deadlines, he'll do colour correction, but no retouching.

so, gina's paper is being published, and i'm called on to do all the marketing around it. this includes getting professional hard copies of the document, a social media strategy and some conference speaking work.

the thing is, gina's headshot is a little... off.

as a thumbnail, it's fine, but when it's zoomed in, you can see a definite moustache. not a little ""maybe she ate a chocolate doughnut for lunch"" mo, but a lip full of whiskers that you'd expect to see on a 90 year old woman who enjoys hitting children with her walking stick.

so, i can't exactly call up and ask if i should do something about this, as it's not really a conversation i want to have, and i'm also not known as the most tactful person. i'm very familiar with photoshop, and use it all the time (i've got no graphic design qualifications though, so i'm very slow by comparison), so i go about just blending and masking her whiskers a bit. i'm zoomed right in on her mouth to clean up the zone.

i work in an open office, but not many people are in my immediate area. still, it's not something i want to embarrass her about, so any time someone walks by, i alt-tab to a different screen, or move the pic to a different area.

lo and behold, gina decides to drop by with her feedback on the printed draft that she's marked up. as she comes by, i hear her footsteps and hit the scroll wheel on the mouse. she comes in and freezes, asks what i'm doing. i say im just tweaking a picture, and when i look at my own screen, it's zoomed right in on her cleavage.

she gets louder and asks what the fuck i'm doing fixing her chest area. she then asks if i'm making her breasts bigger, or doing something shady. for some reason, i decide to avoid telling her the truth and just say i'm evening out the skin tone.

she dumps the hard copy draft and walks away.

about an hour later, i get an email from hr saying that i need to stop working on this project, and come in for an interview.  i ask if i can speak privately first, and explain the situation. i still get in a lot of trouble for fixing an image without her consent, and that gina is more than her appearance, and a suggestion that it's sexist to try and ""make her prettier"". i acknowledge that, but also mention that i tidy up all images that are going to be blown up, men and women alike, but to be honest, i'm just trying to get out of the awkwardness. 

we have the meeting, and i had to explain the whole thing to gina directly. she is adamant that she doesn't have a moustache (an to be fair, while sitting there, she doesn't. she's sorted that out in the days between the pic and this event). she then goes on to suggest that i altered the pic to add the lip hair as an excuse for staring at her chest (worth noting here, she wasn't dressed provocatively or anything, just normal corporate wear).

i then had to get the photographer to re-send the originals to the hr rep, and they indeed show her lip-bristles.

she's still livid, and hr suggest that i should jump off this project. 

i'm actually a bit concerned as to where this leaves me going forward, as she does have a bit of influence. i told my boss the whole story and he's assured me i'll be fine, in-between being sympathetic, and stifling his laughter at my misfortune.

my sister and i have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. my niece told my sister about it when she got home. my sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. so they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge.

update: my sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. the board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. the school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution. thank you to the people who were helpful!",2

their door was cracked open, so there's the fuck up. i walk in and am greeted by the sight of my mother blowing my dad. as i hear my mom say ""do ya mind??"", i immediately walk the other way, and back downstairs to my room. all the while trying to burn away what i just saw.

they leave for the weekend at noon, and i have no plans on seeing them again this morning.

tl;dr: jeff epstein decided to scar me from beyond the grave.

edit: in one hour on a throwaway, i get more karma than my 4 year old account, first time getting silver, and front page for the first time? huh.

anyway, back on the ""fuck jeff epstein"" train.",4
"bank gave away my entire banking account. so last week, a check i wrote bounced from an account i have that i rarely use. it's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. i called the bank where i was informed that i closed the account to pay for ""my wedding"". i told them i sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. after them jerking me around ""are you sure you're not getting married"" ""did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding""...etc. i finally got them to open a fraud case. 

here's the crazy part. i call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. i finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. this woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. she lives in florida and i live in colorado. we do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. so she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. i figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. open and shut case.

so now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. they asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but i have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. the icing on the cake was i got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

do i have any legal recourse? do i just shut up and hope she doesnt steal my identity and be glad they're giving my money back? what advice do you have?",2

"i don't care about school shootings, and neither should you.. using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't i? if i contended this in public, i'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. but from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. here's why.

&#x200b;

**1,153.** that's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per the washington post.(https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) this averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - terrorism.** let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on united states soil in 2016. this is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. source(https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - falling.** whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 us lives in 2011. the amount of fucks i give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around mercury. so why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   source(https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - diabetes.** if you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. source(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200b;

and, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **airplane/spacecraft crash** \- 26 deaths
* **drowning in the bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **getting struck by a projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **pedestrian getting nailed by a lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **accidentally strangling yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200b;

now, here's a new york times article(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*new reality for high school students: calculating the risk of getting shot.*"" complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? what it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the washington post:(https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>that means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly 1 in 614,000,000**. and since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. the chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200b;

in percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. it's a number so remarkably small that every calculator i tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. there is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",6

"for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 ford bronco i owned as a teenager?. so how to begin with this...i realize that on paper i am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations i'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even i did the right thing. 

when i was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 ford bronco. it was my true passion and i don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. plus my dad and i would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when i was teenager it was always that bronco that brought us back together. i made a huge mistake and sold the truck when i turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, i've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

we had a baby in early february. she is our first and the light of my life. my wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. i guess i need to say this. 

two weeks ago i was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. i stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. my dad and i had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so i just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't my bronco! 

i asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on i-25 as we spoke from colorado to buy it for $21000. i freaked out and asked him if i could buy it right then and there for $23000. he said if i could come up with the cash, yes. i had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so i had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, i maxed out my credit card to venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and i fucking drove away in my old car. it was like a dream come true. like a literal dream come true. it needs a lot of work i can't afford right now but it's mine. like in my driveway mine. again. i can't even describe what a joy this is. 

my wife and her parents are furious with me. they feel i was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. my point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. but this bronco means everything to me and if i wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. to me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

like i said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. how do you guys see it?

edit: had no idea this would go so one way. i guess i messed up. i talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. the $4k will be a gift and she's going to give me whatever i need to restore it. she's always been awesome to me and she's rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. sorry to get everyone so mad at me, i was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the ""mommy bailed you out"" comments really necessary ? i found a solution and it's coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it's not like i'm not paying for it on my own eventually.

edit 3: my inbox is so buried i have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. does anyone know what those are ?

edit4: i'm getting a 403 error whenever i try to respond, not sure what that means but i'm still reading because honestly i'm afraid to go home even with the great news i know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? i messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/snausagefest since you're a mod, do you know? i can't respond to any posts and get the ""status 403"" whenever i try. thanks!

edit in the morning: i couldn't figure out why i was getting so many private's  but i guess this must be locked now. i didn't tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and said i found a buyer for the bronco. i'll figure out how to cross that bridge when i get there but my wife was so relieved that i ""had come to your senses"" i don't want to disappoint her. it's going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",3

we've been together for 3 months and i had no idea that she held those beliefs. she's always been a calm, ""make love not war"" kinda person and very kind to everyone. this is completely out of character and i'm still not sure if she was trolling or not. 

yesterday evening we were sitting in the car and she was talking to some guy from her internship. she sounded heated and they were clearly arguing over something. when she hung up she said that he was an asshole, a douchebag etc...then she started calling him a ""dirty ass jew"". i was shocked to say the least and didn't even know what to say, it came out of nowhere. she said that all jews are ""extremely arrogant"" and that they disgust her. 

for the record, we never discussed our religious backgrounds. neither of us are religious (she's middle eastern) so that's just not something we ever brought up. 


she continued saying that you can't trust jews, that they're all ""rats"" and that she'd rather die than associate with someone ""so corrupt"". i asked her if that's how she really feels and she said yes of course.


i still haven't told her that i'm jewish, i'm not even sure how she will react when i do tell her. should i even bother? it sucks because she's an amazing girl and i'm ridiculously attracted to her but had no clue she was like this. any advice?

"update: old coworkers are telling me my old boss talks to them about ""all the issues i'm having."" found out my therapist is my old boss's husband. (mn). original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/anlpqr/old_coworkers_are_telling_me_my_old_boss_talks_to/)

&#x200b;

**old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that i was having a ton of issues. i found out my therapist is her husband, but i didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200b;

**new developments summary**: there's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. i even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200b;

**new developments, continued**: therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). i have a very peculiar family dynamic, so i think he talked about that. however, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that i was depressed and had family issues. neat. one of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200b;

**resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than i thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. i don't know if he'll practice again.

"boston, my therapist has created a false rape and forced abortion and is reporting it on my behalf, i was not raped.. i am in boston but my abortion happened in new york city. i was 18 and this was completely legal. 

i'm 18 and in college. like all 18 year olds, i mess up. i messed up big time and i ended up pregnant. i waited a week after my pregnancy test came up positive, i went to the doctor to 100% confirm the pregnancy, and my best friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, and i took a couples' trip to nyc so i could have the abortion in a safe environment and have everything taken care of in a timely manner. 

we got back to boston and life went on. i am in therapy to work through my problems regarding the suicide attempts of my older sister and dealing with the repercussions of her mental illness. i have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, i'm not considered depressed, i have no history of any kind of any mental illnesses, self harm, or anything of the sort. i receive my therapy in a non religious environment. this is just straight up confidential counseling because my sister attempted suicide right before i went to college, my parents are toxic, and i needed help with that burden. 

i told my therapist immediately that i'd had an abortion, told her my reasons (cost of a baby, not wanting children, i go to a university that i worked my ass off to get into and i'll be damned if i let an unwanted pregnancy ruin my life. i also could not raise a child that i disdained. selfish? yes. but i'm not sorry). i also informed her that my boyfriend and i are still together and that he and i plan on staying together, the sex was between two adults who 100% consented, it was just a mixup and confusion on both of our parts. he and i split the cost of the abortion with him paying 75% of the cost. 

i go home and do homework. at around 4 pm, i get a visit from the boston police who are investigating a rape. they think that i'm the victim and my boyfriend is the perpetrator and that i've been forced to have an abortion, i ask them where they got this false information and give them proof that both he and i agreed that abortion was the way to go. after a lot of talking to smooth things over and apologizing, they left. 

then i get a call from my parents. they're ranting on and on about how i've gotten an abortion and sinned in god's eyes, how i've been fornicating and screwed every man in nyc, and how my lack of contact (i'm nc with them because of abuse and they're narcissists) is killing my mother. they screamed down the phone for four hours before telling me that they've been given my address in boston by my therapist and are coming to get me no matter what. 

it becomes clear. my therapist called the police, reported a false rape and forced abortion, violated all sorts of confidentiality, and had to track my parents down (i never gave her their number, address, or personal information. she did not know their names, i only ever called them mom and dad) to call them to say that i'd been raped and gotten an abortion. 

i never gave her any sort of go ahead to do anything. i never used the word rape in our sessions, in fact, when i mentioned the sex, i called it ""consensual sex"". the police are still hounding me, i'm freaking out and constantly having panic attacks, my therapist is making things worse by continuing to knowingly provide false information to the police (although i gave them the information that should have ended this all), therapist is also saying that i have stockholm syndrome and that's why i won't report my boyfriend, and i'm at a loss for what to do. 

i also know why she's having some weird witch hunt. my boyfriend is in a fraternity and in her mind, i was brutally raped at a fraternity party (this is what she told the police). i was not and in the session i said specifically told her that i never had sex with him at his fraternity house several times when she tried to convince me that i was raped at his fraternity house. 

i've also started to get calls from the nypd investigating the ""forced abortion"" and i'm freaking out and don't know what to do. this is serious. 

at this point in time i know that i need to get the police off my butt. is there a way that would help me? is a lawyer the best way to go? also, is there a way for me to report my therapist and make sure that she is punished? is there a way to make sure she doesn't do this again? 


edit: when the cops came the first time, i told them that she was completely falsifying everything and i gave them evidence. she is continuing to call and labeling me with various mental illnesses so she gets her point across and so i'm not taken seriously. the last time the cops called was last night.

anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. but all these kids know sign language, and i thought that was pretty damn cool. so i start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it's working! suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say ""more"" and ""all done"" and ""drink""! she can call me mom and my husband, dad! holy shit! thanks pinterest moms! i take back all the shit i talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

well today with my husband out of town, i didn't feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants i decided to go out for a quick dinner. the kid loves french fries and so do i. so we hit the local burger joint and i order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. the server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and i set it out of her reach so she doesn't hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. so of course every time she wants some, she signs ""drink"". and every time she wants my attention, she signs ""dad"" because apparently the slightly different sign for ""mom"" isn't as fun for her. ok, whatever. 

well i notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they're looking over at us and snickering. i'm like okay, i did like 4 quick google searches, maybe i botched some of what i taught her. it's fine. but then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iphone down with a message typed out for me to read. it says something to the effect of ""she's calling you 'dumb' and telling you she wants to drink alcohol"". 

i'm like... wait... what? so she continues to show me that i have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for ""drink (non-alcoholic beverage)"" and ""drink alcohol"" and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since i am her mom. i can only imagine what the pinterest moms would've done had i shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

tl;dr asl is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

eta: thanks, everyone! i'm glad you all enjoyed this post. please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that i was trying to teach my child proper asl. they were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as asl. they just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

also please note that i literally searched ""baby sign language"" and based the signs off of still frames from google. i have no idea how close they were to the real signs. additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. she speaks english well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. we were always sure to say the words while signing them. she now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that i decided to share with you all. i'm new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen ""today"". you can take back your upvotes for this as necessary :)",4

don't get me wrong, there are some exceptions to this rule--if someone has the ability to help with something, but doesn't want to get off their ass, but still wants brownie points for ""helping"" and so they pull the ""i'll pray"" card, then yes, they are the asshole.

but that is why i added ""with sincerity."" if they can't help, if there's nothing they can do, all they can do is appeal to the highest power they know. if you don't believe in their god, or a god at all, that's totally fine. but don't be fucking rude about it.",6

so thank you to everyone who responded. and i guess thank you to everyone in the dms who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, i want to sleep in my own house. just to allay the fears of the other nice dm's, i did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

i took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on monday night. i also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. i called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

he was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the da actually pursuing this were slim to none. he did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, i could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. he said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


so basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as i type this) but i just heard (wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. in fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. the people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. they also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all i know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people i've ever encountered). the can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). so with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

so our complaint to animal control from last thursday is still on the books. the lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. the criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

"why is sleep deprivation normalized in college/university?. in one of my classes the other day, one of my classmates was doing a presentation on college life. at one point he jokingly said something along the lines of ""being successful in college means many nights with little to no sleep and breakdowns"" and the entire class and the professor thought that was hilarious and everyone laughed it off. and i was sorta just sitting there wondering why we, as a society, think its perfectly fine sacrifice our physical and mental health for academic success.

"for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?. new to reddit, please bare with. 

so i (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

however, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. she and i have quite a lot in common, and i actually like spending time with her. however it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; i'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. however, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if i want coffee. i sleep naked. every time prior to the last one, i've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. i always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but i didn't"". 

when she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, i intentionally slept on top of the covers. sure enough, she barges in at 7am, begins to ask if i want coffee and sees my you-know-what. she immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. my mate later pulled me aside and said i was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that i'd ""threatened"" to do it before (i literally just said ""okay but what if i had no covers and you saw everything"" before). they're now framing this to others that i'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how i get my rocks off, and i'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. for doing this?",3

"for refusing to pay alimony to my cheating ex-wife. i met my wife in my early 30s. she was in her mid 20s at the time. i was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. she on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. 

so when i meet her we click instantly and i fall head over heels for her. we get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. when we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. obviously i was jealous but i went along with it since it seemed logical.

so she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while i work 12 hour days and then some. i'm not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.

a couple years ago i discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend's husband. divorced obviously followed.

the only major asset we had in the us was our house, which was a premarital asset. we had a shared bank account, but since i am a finance guy i handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. 

now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, i'd have no problem paying what's fair. but the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. 

so in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.

so here i am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. so i sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it's taking so long to liquidate our savings. once abroad i immediately stop alimony payments.

now she has no legal recourse (i've double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.

the reason i'm asking here is that my own children are split on this. my son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. i figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",3

we have done some reading and been to a councillor but it always ends up along the ""learning to be nicer to her so she'll get in the mood"" lines which is rubbish for our situation. no matter how happy, relaxed, rested, etc she is, the idea of sex is an instant agitation to her and she gets mad.

essentially...
- if i try to get her in the mood, she gets pissed.
- if i am super nice and thoughtful etc, she is happy but nothing happens.
- if i do nothing, nothing happens.

recently ive stopped asking... and the fighting has stopped and she's happy... but im dying inside.

is our relationship over and we just need to cut the cord? or is it normal and do i need to just come to terms with my sex life being over? i dont want an affair etc, i want my wife to want a physical relationship with me... is that too much to ask?

"update had a falling out with the girl i love and got served a cease and desist order. what can i legally do? michigan (x-post on r/relationships). past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

oh boy. i've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. i wasn't going to, but i know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and i actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and i read all the comments there. it was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. i decided i needed to post again for some closure. i would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

for those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so i'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. i want to take full accountability for everything, so i want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

first, i want to assure everyone that i didn't contact that girl ever again. since i moved, i no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (i don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. i have avoided getting any information about her at all). the way i acted and the way i hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but i know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. if she wants to get closure by talking to me, i'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. i don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. i learned in my classes that men do that a lot. i don't want to hurt her anymore, so i will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

i was distraught after my last post here. i admit i came here looking for validation, not help. i had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that i was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that i needed help. all of these people were right. i don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive i was in response to the comments). i checked myself into therapy in michigan the week after i posted here. i knew something was wrong, but i was still in denial. i thought i needed help with heartbreak. i didn't recognize that i actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that i used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. after a few sessions, i started seeing a psychiatrist too. i got on mood stabilizers and i started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way i was acting. something that couldn't be cured by medication. after talking it over with my therapist, i decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my aunt's house. within a month of me posting here, i had moved into her house. 

after moving, i started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. i had a fresh idea of the issues i wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that i was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in michigan (though i wasn't stalking anyone at this point, i was just obsessing in my mind. which is still bad, but i wasn't actively victimizing anyone). i realize that in addition to therapy, i needed more help. my therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so i signed up voluntarily. i attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. the goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  i know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? people like me. people like me in the last post. i look like a normal person. i grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. monsters come in all shapes and sizes and i fooled myself by saying because i didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because i wasn't ""like"" the abusers i saw on tv, that i wasn't one. but i am. i can't take back what i've done, but i can promise myself i will never victimize anyone else again. 

in conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. i want to say that i do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. i made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because i thought i had the right to dictate how others interact with me. the class is a year-long class and i have only been in it for a month, but i have already learned so much. i have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. but i believe that since i've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. i've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so i made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people i am stalking or believe i am in love with (i talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and i'm sorry for how i decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice i asked for.

**tl;dr**: i ceased, i desisted, and i got mental health help. thanks to everyone.

**edit**: wow, just wow. i didn't expect this response. i guess this is a top post of all time. 
i wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. i read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though i didn't reply to many. i cried a lot while reading them. 

2. i didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. i'm not sure why i did it, but i don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. i don't know if i deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. but thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. i've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program i am in. the program i am in is specific to my area, so i'd rather not disclose the name. however, i encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" i did some research today about the class i am in and that is what these types of classes are called. they all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. there is no official federal program i don't think.

4. i am not healed. i have a lot of obsessive thoughts and i have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. my meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process i need to change and that cant be done with pills. i have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. i have never had real ""friends"" until the ones i have now. before jaime, i definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women i had crushes on and men i wanted to be friends with. it was never as bad as it was with jaime, but i still am sure i made people uncomfortable.  i also have some self-harm behaviors i am working out. so to the person who was worried that i would use all of the good praise to say ""oh i'm perfect now so i can do what i want,"" trust me, i know i am fucked up and i want to change. i want to have normal relationships and friendships. i want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

please get help if you need it. take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",2

kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that i was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. it's flattering to read that so many of you think that joe and i are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with kim. it was humbling for kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

for those who are asking, i didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because i wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone i know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. but since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, i bought jack a horse. my family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem.

"by letting my parents have access to my bank account and student loan money.. backstory- my parents wanted me to learn responsibility with money when i was in middle school so they opened a bank account for me with a debit card. they have complete access to it and can take out or add money if they want to. multiple times while in high school i had money saved up in my account and they took huge chunks out because they ""needed it."" i was paid back in increments when they took large amounts of money out but i still don't think they have fully paid me back for all the money they took. 

fast forward to now and i still haven't learned my lesson of keeping my money in a separate account that they don't have access to. i have to take our student loans to pay for school (tuition, rent, utilities, food, etc). i had $4000 in student loan money in my account last month and i get a text from my mom saying she transferred all that money to her account so she could pay my rent in advance for the next couple months. i didn't understand why she did that because i've been paying my monthly rent just fine but i said okay and didn't think twice about it until yesterday. 

my rent is due the first of each month and if my mom would have prepaid my rent, i should not have gotten a notification to pay it. but i did get a notification and i was confused. i logged online to look at my account and it said i needed to make a payment. i thought it was just an error or something so i called the 24 hour hotline and they told me there was no payment ever made. i confronted my mom about this and she said ""oh crap i forgot to pay it! let me go pay it real quick."" i was relieved but only for a little bit. she came back later and told me my dad spent all my loan money on bills and christmas gifts because he thought it was theirs. she told me she is sorry but they don't have the money right now to pay me back because they don't have any extra money leftover after christmas. so now i have come up with enough money to pay my rent and utility bill and am out $4000. i doubt i will ever see anything close to that $4000 again.

tl;dr - parents have access to my bank account and mom took out my $4000 in loan money to pay my rent. dad spent all the money and they can't pay me back. i'm out $4000.  

edit - i have since created a new checking account online at a different bank and will be moving what money i have left into the new account and will be adding my direct deposit to the new account. thank you all for the advice so far and the support!

edit 2 - i am overwhelmed with the number of people who have pm'd me offering advice, kind words, and even offering me money or starting a gofundme. i'm amazed how much people would do for a complete stranger and can't express my gratitude enough. however, i was smart enough with my money last semester and have enough saved up to still pay my rent. i never thought i would need a rainy-day fund so soon haha. but i am okay and it would feel wrong to accept any of your money. you all are an example of how much good is in this world.",4

i scolded my son and gave a ""sorry"" wave to the driver. at the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. his car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. he rolled down the window and shouted the n-word at my son. my son's face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. the encounter **sickened** me.

i did some research on the company; at one point i even plugged them into facebook. they have a very active facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. i called the company and reported the man's behavior, describing him very vividly. they informed me that they knew exactly who i was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. i had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.

two months later, when i was browsing facebook kind of boredly one day, the company's name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it i clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. one of the very first photos/posts i saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. to my horror, i saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. meaning they didn't fire him.

the company is part of a nationwide chain, so i called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person i could get to, and i reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn't fire him. the man i spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person i'd reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have ""no place"" and ""no future"" in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee's career is now toast.

was it right of me to ""double-report"" this guy? i'm sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that i was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. am i an asshole or a ""karen"" for not dropping this matter?",3
